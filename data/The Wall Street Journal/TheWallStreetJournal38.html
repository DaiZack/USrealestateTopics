<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose last month, as distressed properties and low prices helped bolster the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that sales of previously owned homes rose 2.9% in April, compared with March, to a 4.68 million annual rate. The increase nearly reversed March's decline, though the sales were 3.5% below the level in April 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home sales keep chopping around," said <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>. economist Michael Feroli. "We're seeing continued evidence that things are stable, albeit at very low levels."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of distressed properties, such as homes in foreclosure, accounted for 45% of the April total, down from exactly half in March. Those sales are driving prices lower; the average selling price of $170,200 was 15.4% below the year-ago level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in home prices is aggravating many households' woes: Because the value of their homes has fallen below what they owe on their mortgage, they can't clear their debt by selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate government report suggests that the home-price declines may not be as severe as those shown by the National Association of Realtors, a trade association. The Federal Housing Finance Agency said its national housing-price index was 7.1% below its year-ago level in the first quarter, compared with the fourth quarter's year-over-year decline of 8.3%. Nevada registered the steepest decline, with prices falling 31.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' home-price measure can be distorted by the mix of homes sold in a month. If fewer high-end homes are sold, for example, that will drive the price measure down. The government measure avoids these problems by including only homes with financing from <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. It also doesn't include homes with subprime mortgages, which have made up the bulk of the housing-market problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The separate S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national home-price index, which fell 19.1% in the first quarter, avoids the distortions of the Realtors, and includes homes with subprime mortgages. But because it is based on prices in the 100 largest metropolitan areas, its scope isn't as wide as the government's.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes in the U.S. climbed modestly in April as buyers took advantage of foreclosures and snatched up property carrying discounted price tags.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales rose by 2.9% to a 4.68 million annual rate from 4.55 million in March, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. The NAR originally reported that March sales fell 3% to 4.57 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The April resales level was above Wall Street expectations of a 4.67 million sales rate for previously owned homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 45% of the 4.68 million in April sales were foreclosures and "short sales" -- in which a homeowner sells the home for less than the amount owed on it. The large number of these distressed-property sales has driven prices lower, year over year. The median price for an existing home in the U.S. last month was $170,200, down 15% from $201,300 in April 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak demand has kept inventories of unsold homes high. Inventories of previously owned homes jumped 8.8% at the end of April to 3.97 million available for sale. That represented a 10.2-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with 9.6 in March. Bloated inventories, in turn, are depressing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of the sales are taking place in lower price ranges and activity is beginning to pick up in the midprice ranges, but high-end home sales remain sluggish," NAR economist Lawrence Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower prices, combined with historically low borrowing costs, have increased affordability. The average 30-year mortgage rate was 4.81% in April, down from 5% in March, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> data show. Realtors also hope demand is stirred by the $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers included in the Obama administration's economic-stimulus package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decline in prices is troubling because it can give pause to would-be buyers who hope for a better deal. On a bright note, the median price, on a monthly basis, has climbed for three months in a row. It was $169,900 in March, a downward revision from an originally reported $175,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working against sales are tighter mortgage-lending standards, which have made it harder to finance a purchase. And the uncertain economic outlook is hurting the existing-home market. The U.S. unemployment rate rose to 8.9% in April from 8.5% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, year over year, were down 3.5% from April 2008.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lingling Wei   </div><div>1075 words</div><div>27 May 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lingling WeiMarket enthusiasm for the Federal Reserve's plan to help the commercial-real-estate market was doused Tuesday after <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> warned that billions of dollars of top-rated bonds backed by commercial mortgages could face downgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financing drought in commercial real estate is threatening to cause major damage to the economy, so the sector was cheered when the Fed announced in March that it would expand one of its main rescue programs to help resuscitate the $700 billion market for bonds backed by mortgages on office towers, strip malls and other commercial property. The market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, rallied on the news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> action has raised doubts about how effective the Fed program will be. Investors responded Tuesday by selling off CMBS, with yields on triple-A securities widening to 10.7% from 9.4% one week ago, according to data tracker Trepp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed program, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, is designed to jump-start lending by increasing investor demand for securities tied to all kinds of assets, including commercial real estate. So far, the $1 trillion program has been made available only for consumer debt, such as credit-card loans. The program makes available inexpensive loans to investors buying these securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TALF will soon start offering this low-cost, nonrecourse financing to investors to purchase CMBS. But under the Fed's rules, only the highest rated CMBS are eligible. That is why S&amp;P's action sparked so much consternation. The rating agency announced proposed changes to its CMBS rating method that would likely lead to substantial downgrades on triple-A-rated bonds issued from 2005 through 2007. That would make them ineligible for TALF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P said the loans made during those years featured "increasingly more aggressive underwriting" than those made in prior years. In other words, lenders were overly optimistic about rents, occupancies and values. In fact, they have all fallen sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers have been worried that without TALF, banks and other financial institutions may suffer hundreds of billions of dollars worth of losses from value declines and defaults on commercial-real-estate loans. "This program is critical to restoring the flow of credit to owners of commercial real estate and preventing a damaging chain of events in this market," Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said in recent testimony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TALF program has two parts to help commercial real estate: One to create a market for existing CMBS; the other to unfreeze the market for new CMBS issues. Wall Street sold $230 billion of CMBS in 2007, a record year, compared with $10 billion in 2008 and zero so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of banks including <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. have been working on new CMBS deals that could be eligible for TALF financing, according to people familiar with the matter. Representatives at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some borrowers are gearing up, too. <span class="companylink">Developers Diversified Realty Corp</span>., an owner of 710 shopping centers globally, is preparing to be among the first real-estate-investment trusts to borrow against properties through the program. Developers Diversified is assembling a pool of at least $750 million in shopping centers to be used as collateral for a CMBS deal of $250 million to $300 million, says David Oakes, the REIT's chief investment officer. "Just to get the market started again is very important to the industry overall," Mr. Oakes says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But owners of highly leveraged property likely won't be able to take advantage of the rekindled CMBS market, at least for now. The first few TALF-eligible CMBS deals should be backed by "very conservative loans," says Hugh Balloch, managing principal at Goff Capital Partners LP, a Stamford, Conn., private-equity firm specializing in commercial-real-estate investments. That would leave highly levered borrowers to have to find ways to "fill that gap with equity" or face potential foreclosures, Mr. Balloch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed, mindful of protecting taxpayers' interests, has set high bars for the type of loan it will accept as eligible for TALF financing. Among those that won't qualify: floating-rate mortgages, construction loans or loans secured by properties that don't have a steady cash flow, according to the Fed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, instead of solely relying on rating agencies, the Fed also will hire firms in the private sector to help it screen the quality of the loans. A handful of firms will be hired within the next few weeks to serve as collateral monitors for the Fed, people familiar with the issue said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Parkus, head of CMBS research at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, estimates at least two-thirds, or $410 billion, of the CMBS loans maturing from this year to 2018 wouldn't be able to refinance without more cash put up by the property owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, other hurdles also exist for a return of the CMBS market involving the so-called B-piece of CMBS issues, bankers and investors caution. Typically when banks slice commercial mortgages into bonds, the tranches first in line to suffer losses in a default are ones rated single-B by rating firms that also pay the highest interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TALF program is only financing investors' purchases of the top tranche, triple-A-rated bonds. That means banks may still have a hard time getting investors to buy B-piece debt with no government-sponsored financing available. Some market participants also worry that potential B-piece buyers may be discouraged because, under the TALF funding terms, it is unclear if B-piece buyers would have control over how to work out a loan with a borrower in the event of default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key question for a B-piece buyer is "how do you avoid having 25% of your class wiped out" in a default situation, said Eric Hillenbrand, chief executive of Hillenbrand Partners in Chicago. His firm, which specializes in buying B-piece debt, is talking to some financial institutions about structuring a CMBS deal to take advantage of the TALF financing. The potential size of the deal: $300 million to $500 million.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lisa Scherzer   </div><div>Smart Money</div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watching a home's value plunge by double-digit percentages in a matter of months is enough to unnerve even the most financially secure homeowner. And, as the real estate market continues to reel concerns are growing that the free fall is far from over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Playing into that anxiety are two companies – EquityLock Financial, based in Austin, Texas, and Lighthouse Group based in Charlotte, N.C. – that are selling products promising to put a little more control in homeowners' hands. Their pitch? That homeowners could spend a little now to hedge against declines in the value of their home later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how it works: For a fee of 1% to 3% of their home's value, homeowners buy a contract that protects them against the loss of equity in their home if the market takes a turn for the worse. The contract, which should not be confused with an insurance policy, pays the homeowner when he sells his home in a market where average home prices have dropped since their purchase. The amount he receives is tied to the size of the market's decline, as measured by one of two home price indexes (both of which are based on sales of single-family homes).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Say you buy a home in Denver for $300,000. Five years later, after Denver's home price index falls 10%, you sell it for $290,000. At closing, the company you bought the equity protection from pays you $30,000 – your original purchase price times 10%. Even if you sold your home for more than what you paid to buy it, you can still make the claim – as long as the index fell. (If the index rises, however, you can't make a claim and you're out the $6,000 you spent buying the contract.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the kind of product that ends up being useful for a niche part of the population, but likely not really worthwhile for homeowners in general," says Todd Sinai, associate professor of real estate at the Wharton School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor to consider is how long you plan to live in your home. If it's going to be 10 or 15 years, buying protection doesn't make much sense, says Susan Wachter, real estate professor at Wharton. While home prices can change dramatically in the short term, they hold steady and increase over longer periods. For short-term homeowners, though, it might make more sense. If, for instance, you anticipate a move for work and worry that area prices will sag, the protection can be worthwhile, says Sinai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We spoke with real estate experts about what to look out for when shopping for home equity protection plans. Here's what they had to say:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calculate the costs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Payment terms are different for each product. EquityLock's premium, which is paid upfront, ranges from 1% to 3% of the purchase price (or of the current value if you already own a home). Lighthouse's premium could be paid either on a monthly or yearly basis, and typically works out to just under 1% of the home's value, per year, says a company spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Say your house is worth $300,000 and you pay $6,000 (a 2% premium) for EquityLock's protection. You're starting with a $6,000 loss, and you'll only break even if the house index drops enough from the time you purchase the home to the time you decide to sell. "You really have to think hard if the initial cost is worth it," says Sinai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watch out for lockout periods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be sure to ask about any lockout period which bars you from collecting payment before a set time. EquityLock imposes an exclusion term ranging from 18 to 30 months from the time the protection is purchased. So you can't sell your home and make a claim a year after the contract begins. Lighthouse has no lockout period. But if a homeowner exercises the contract after, say, the first month, they still owe the future monthly payments that are due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing indexes are imperfect</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential payouts are tied to a house price index: either the S&amp;P Case-Shiller house price index, which tracks 20 metro markets, or the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>'s House Price Index, commonly known as OFHEO, which covers 386 markets. The problem? Indexes don't capture the true volatility and variation within markets – and don't always correlate with the specific value of your home, says Jonathan Adams, a finance professor at NYU. For example, if highway construction has just gotten underway at the next block over, chances are your home's value would dive – but the index might stay the same, says Adams. (Lighthouse says tying the contract to an index is the most efficient way to determine a home's value, without having to actually sell the house or get an appraisal.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be wary of new, untested products</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bear in mind the novelty of these plans when assessing their worth. "When it comes to finances and your home equity, you really want to go with someone who has a history," says Alison Southwick, spokeswoman for the Better Business Bureau. Also, new products tend to be more expensive, says Mark Browne, professor of risk management at the University of Wisconsin. They haven't been around for long, so it might be better to wait for competition to build.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks churned to a mixed finish on Tuesday after a surprisingly weak report on the housing market failed to puncture investors' optimism about an impending economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 29.23 points, or 0.3%, at 8474.85, weighed down by a slide of 5.3% for <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> after the home-improvement giant posted stronger-than-expected earnings but said that its sales and margins declined. The chain reaffirmed its guidance for the year ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An upbeat earnings outlook from <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> rival <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> stirred hopes of an imminent turnaround for the housing market on Monday, but that thesis took a knock on Tuesday when data showed housing starts unexpectedly fell in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large decline in apartment groundbreakings offset a modest increase in new single-family construction, causing housing starts to fall 12.8% compared to the prior month, the Commerce Department reported. But some economists said that the increased building of single-family homes is a positive sign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Since this area is where most of the housing problems originated, ongoing though slow healing here is a positive step," economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.18 points, or 0.13%, to close at 1734.54. The S&amp;P 500-stock index slipped 1.58 points, or 0.2%, to 908.13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another promising sign was a retreat for the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index push below 30 for the first time since September. The VIX had indicated that even buyers of stocks were willing to pay lofty premiums to hedge their bets on the options market ever since September. It ended down more than 5% at 28.66.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other stress indicators eased. The spread between the London interbank offered rate and yields on Treasury bonds has continued to retreat from its peak late last year. That shows that money is flowing around the banking system with ease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're just not seeing the volatility of forced selling right now and that creates a ton of positives for the market," said Shawn Price, a portfolio manager with Navellier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most traders and analysts remain cautiously bullish on stocks, based in part on the idea that pressure is rising for investors sitting on the sidelines to put to work their excess cash. That money is garnering little interest because of the Federal Reserve's rock-bottom target intended to spur an economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil futures briefly moved over $60 a barrel to hit a six-month high. The front-month contract settled up 62 cents, or 1.1%, at $59.65 a barrel.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. home construction unexpectedly fell in April, toppled by a sharp drop in apartment starts that cast a shadow over signs of stabilization in housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts decreased 12.8% to a seasonally adjusted 458,000 annual rate compared with the prior month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Starts fell 8.5% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires forecast a 2% increase in April starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leading the fall, construction of housing with two or more units dropped 46.1% as developers struggled to get financing. Single-family housing starts, though, rose 2.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We still have a large glut of homes for sale, particularly used ones," Weiss Research analyst Mike Larson said. "But these figures add to the evidence of potential stabilization in that part of the industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been other indications the housing crisis might be nearing an end. New-home sales, for instance, are up from a January low. Builder confidence in the housing market is growing. The National Association of Home Builders' latest Housing Market Index rose to 16 in May from 14 in April and nine in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It increasingly looks like January was the bottom for home sales [new and existing], home builder confidence, and single-family housing starts," wrote Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, the job market is very weak, credit is tight and inventories of homes are high. People are buying foreclosed existing homes for a discount, rather than new homes.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction in the U.S. fell to a new low last month. But an increase in the construction of single-family homes suggests the slump in home building is drawing to a close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the pace of construction starts fell to an annual rate of 458,000 new homes, a 12.8% drop from March. That was the lowest level since 1959, when the Commerce Department began tracking the figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline was wholly the result of a sharp drop in ground-breaking for apartment buildings and other multifamily dwellings. Single-family home construction rose 2.8% to 368,000 in April, after rising slightly in March as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in the single-family figures adds to evidence that residential construction has begun to recover. The National Association of Home Builders said Monday that its measure of home-builder sentiment increased for a second month in May. New-home sales appear to be turning upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Temkin, owner of T&amp;M Building in Torrington, Conn., has started to see business pick up. After weekends when hardly anyone came by, foot traffic in his model homes is back up, and he just made the first two sales in nearly a year in one of his new projects. To adjust to the weak market, he is building smaller homes starting at about $220,000 -- in places where prices once started at more than $350,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We keep tweaking our designs to see what we can come up with that will attract a different crowd," Mr. Temkin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists believe the single-family construction figures are the best measure by which to gauge the housing market. They say builders breaking ground for new homes is the most reliable sign that mortgage woes are getting resolved, that prices have fallen to appropriate levels and that the glut of unsold homes has thinned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though housing may have turned the corner, that doesn't herald a robust recovery in a market where financing is difficult to come by, and many homes continue to bear "for sale" signs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are still huge inventories of vacant homes on the market, so there's still going to be some pressure," said James O'Sullivan, an economist at UBS AG.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To turn renters into homeowners, home builders are getting creative. They're gathering addresses to contact tenants, participating in rent-with-equity programs and wooing them with pet adoption drives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's all part of the broader strategy to boost anemic sales as the sector limps through its worst downturn in decades. "The tougher the market gets, the more back to basics we get," said Dan Klinger, president of K. Hovnanian American Mortgage, the lending subsidiary of builder <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises</span>. "And soliciting renters is about as basic as it comes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers not saddled with an existing home to sell have become critical for a recovery, pushing builders to design smaller and more affordable homes. And they're racing the clock: A federal tax credit of up to $8,000 for qualified first-timers expires Dec. 1, while funds for California's credit of up to $10,000 for buyers of new homes could be exhausted soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are accentuating very low interest rates and more affordable prices that may make owning cheaper than renting. Builders face hurdles including fears among home buyers that prices have further to fall, job insecurity and the inability to secure credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Mid-America Apartment</span> Communities said recently that the number of renters leaving their properties to buy a home in the first quarter fell by 31% compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, with nearly 89 million renters nationwide, there may be potential to sell the 340,000 single-family homes that will be started this year, estimates residential research firm Metrostudy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's a large untapped market," said Jeffrey T. Mezger, <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>'s president and chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its effort to woo renters and emphasize affordability, <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, the nation's fifth-largest builder by annual closings, redid its Web site to highlight monthly payments over the total price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builder also offers more flexible and personalized floor plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our sales are up and our first-time buyer sales are up," Mr. Mezger said. In the first quarter 70% of deliveries went to first-time buyers, compared with 53% a year ago, he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction in the U.S. fell to a new low last month. But an increase in the construction of single-family homes suggests the slump in home building is drawing to a close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the pace of construction starts fell to an annual rate of 458,000 new homes, a 12.8% drop from March. That was the lowest level since 1959, when the Commerce Department began tracking the figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline was wholly the result of a sharp drop in ground-breaking for apartment buildings and other multifamily dwellings. Single-family home construction rose 2.8% to 368,000 in April, after rising slightly in March as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in the single-family figures adds to evidence that residential construction has begun to recover. The National Association of Home Builders said Monday that its measure of home-builder sentiment increased for a second month in May. New-home sales appear to be turning upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Temkin, owner of T&amp;M Building in Torrington, Conn., has started to see business pick up. After weekends when hardly anyone came by, foot traffic in his model homes is back up, and he just made the first two sales in nearly a year in one of his new projects. To adjust to the weak market, he is building smaller homes starting at about $220,000 -- in places where prices once started at more than $350,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We keep tweaking our designs to see what we can come up with that will attract a different crowd," Mr. Temkin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists believe the single-family construction figures are the best measure by which to gauge the housing market. They say builders breaking ground for new homes is the most reliable sign that mortgage woes are getting resolved, that prices have fallen to appropriate levels and that the glut of unsold homes has thinned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though housing may have turned the corner, that doesn't herald a robust recovery in a market where financing is difficult to come by, and many homes continue to bear "for sale" signs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are still huge inventories of vacant homes on the market, so there's still going to be some pressure," said James O'Sullivan, an economist at UBS AG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With rents falling and financing tight, the number of multifamily-home starts fell 46% to 90,000. Regionally, overall new-home construction fell 21.1% in the South, 21.4% in the Midwest and 30.6% in the Northeast, while jumping 42.5% in the West. The number of building permits issued in April fell 3.3% to a 494,000 annual rate, but permits for single-family homes rose 3.6%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign that the market for new homes may be nearing a bottom, home builders became more optimistic about sales conditions this month, according to a trade group's monthly measure of builder sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders' housing-market index rose for the second consecutive month, as new-home sales continued to benefit from falling prices, an $8,000 tax credit for certain first-time home buyers and various state incentives for home buyers.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Riva Richmond </div><div>1722 words</div><div>16 May 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>In-Depth Reports</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(See Corrections &amp;Amplifications item below.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John and Barbara Henningson plotted their retirement on the Connecticut coast for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York couple harbored fond memories from early in their marriage of vacations at a summer home in Madison, Conn., once owned by Ms. Henningson's parents. The pair's wish list included a slower pace, boating and small-town community life—a sharp contrast from 10 years of commuting between a weekday apartment in Manhattan and a suburban home in Westchester County in New York. And they wanted to remain in the Northeast near their son and grandchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So nearly 10 years before Mr. Henningson, an environmental engineer, retired in 2003, the couple began to search for the right waterfront property and community on the stretch of rocky coastline between Milford and Old Lyme. In 1997, they bought a weathered, gray cottage, built in 1902, in the Sachem's Head area of Guilford; the next year, they began spending weekends there. When Ms. Henningson, a financial comptroller at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, retired in 2005, the two sold their Manhattan apartment and settled in Guilford for good (though they do escape to Florida in the dead of winter).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the Henningsons are fully immersed in their new life. Like many old New England towns, Guilford has a town-meeting form of government that depends largely on volunteers. Mr. Henningson lends his expertise as chairman of the town's harbor-management commission and writes news releases for Faulkner's Light Brigade, which helps maintain the historic 1802 Faulkner's Island Lighthouse and its eroding island. Ms. Henningson recently became an elected member of Guilford's board of assessment appeals (an unpaid position), after sitting on the town's economic-development and ethics committees. She is also vice president of the Sachem's Head neighborhood association and active in the Garden Club, which maintains flowers about town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All Inclusive</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New York was never a community," Ms. Henningson says. "If you're interested and you're willing to spend the time, [Guilford is] a very inclusive community. We've made a wonderful circle of friends."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, retirees to Guilford and neighboring towns like Madison are often transplants from New York City and its environs. Some kept a summer home in the area and then chose to settle full time in retirement. Some are moving closer to family, and others are refugees of the more costly and congested New York bedroom communities of Connecticut's Fairfield County, such as Westport and Greenwich, or Westchester County, as in the case of the Henningsons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retirees who once might have moved to Florida or Arizona are making decisions based more on family and social connections, and thus are finding some appealing options in their backyards, says Steve J. Maun, president of Leyland Alliance LLC, a New York firm that plans to build an active-adult neighborhood on the waterfront in Madison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a very strong trend where people want to keep their existing social connections," he says. What's more, they're eschewing the isolation and car-culture of suburbia and rural areas for a more urban life, Mr. Maun notes—a setting in which home-maintenance chores can be minimized, and "they can get a cup of coffee and meet a neighbor."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guilford and Madison are particularly attractive because, unlike many other Connecticut towns, they have retained quaint town centers. Guilford's pride is its old Town Green, where the annual Christmas-tree lighting draws crowds, as do an art fair, free concerts and Shakespeare productions in summer. Surrounding the green are a few boutiques, a coffeehouse and hardware store, as well as Town Hall, several churches and Colonial-era buildings. Madison's Main Street is treasured for its art cinema and an independent bookshop that plays host to top authors and bejewels its heavy wooden cases with staff-scrawled book recommendations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Towns and Country</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The towns are also conveniently located between New York and Boston, both reached by train or car in about two hours. And they're a stone's throw from New Haven, home to Yale University's intellectual community and well-regarded hospital as well as cultural attractions like the Shubert Theater and many restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet despite the proximity to these cities, both Guilford and Madison have managed to preserve much of their natural beauty and historic character. Here, prim 19th-century wood-shuttered homes overlook salt marshes, blue-gray seas or winding wooded roads. Favorite pastimes are hiking in the woods, all-season strolls along the beach and, of course, for sailors and fishermen, taking out the boat. Locals pick their own apples, pears and peaches at Bishop's Orchards—one of the area's few remaining working family farms—as well as hunt, clam and fish for oysters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's all these traditional and old-world things that go into making us special," says Carl Balestracci, Guilford's first selectman. Some towns in New England are governed by boards of selectmen, whose top vote-winner takes on a role similar to that of mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Search for a Sunset</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Jean-Marc and Annick Pandraud, it was the sunset on the water that sold them on Guilford. The French couple, who live in Lexington, Mass., had been mulling whether to stay in the U.S. or to retire in France. They have two daughters in U.S. colleges and one still in high school. If they were going to move elsewhere in the U.S., Ms. Pandraud had one requirement: a view with sunset over water, something she had loved in France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a tall order on the East Coast of the U.S. But Mr. Pandraud, 55, who recently retired as chief operating officer of technology company <span class="companylink">Entegris Inc</span>., contacted a slew of real-estate agents along the Connecticut and Rhode Island coastline in search of the prize. He found it in Guilford, where from a tip of land in Long Island Sound there are sunsets over the ocean when you look southwest in winter. To get the view, the Pandrauds had to buy a summer house in need of winterization, but they aim to move in permanently in the next year and a half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By coincidence, "we found a fantastic community," Mr. Pandraud says. "When you are there after five minutes, you are already in a different world."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judy Whitehead, 68, was lured to Madison by her niece and Hammonasset Beach State Park. She had been living in central Connecticut, where she worked as a metallurgist for <span class="companylink">United Technologies Corp</span>. until she retired at 55. But when her husband died three years ago, she wanted to shed their big house and couple-centered social life and start anew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So she bought a condominium within walking distance of the beach, where she and her husband spent many Saturdays as teenagers before they married. "It took me about 20 minutes to look at the condo and sign the papers on the hood of the real-estate agent's car," Ms. Whitehead says. "I always loved the area."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, she gets her daily exercise, weather permitting, with a walk on the beach, 4½ miles up and back. She has also built a busy social life with lots of women friends by joining two book clubs, a garden club and the American Association of University Women, among other groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Economics</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, it helps to have a good-size wallet to settle along the Connecticut coast—and a good coat. The median price of a home in 2008 was $425,000 in Guilford and $539,500 in Madison, according to the Connecticut Economic Resource Center, a state agency. Winter temperatures regularly dip into the low 20s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Whitehead says the biggest drawback of living in Madison is also a positive—she can't reach a big-box store without driving at least 40 minutes. Indeed, Madison and Guilford, both wealthy towns, have often demonstrated a willingness to bear the price of preserving their characters. They have kept commercial development to a minimum, and, as such, most of the tax burden rests on residential-property owners. Still, residents say tax rates are lower than in New York, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We aren't interested in attracting business and industry," says Madison First Selectman Alfred Goldberg. Homeowners bear 92% of the tax burden and industry only 8%. "That has been a conscious decision."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The towns also aim to protect and expand public green space. Guilford recently negotiated the purchase of 624 acres from a local family for $14.4 million, which will be paid for by selling town bonds offset somewhat by $3 million from the federal government. The property, which includes two miles of riverfront land along the East River and a tidal marsh rich with wildlife, will become a nature preserve with public hiking trails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madison is in the midst of a development controversy over Leyland Alliance's active-adult project, Madison Landing, which has faced resistance among some townspeople. The land, once a private airport, is the last large parcel on Madison's shoreline and is contiguous with Hammonasset Beach State Park. The town has asked Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit skilled at negotiating deals and raising money, to work with it on open-space issues and to consider the possibility of making an offer for the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leyland says it has held "exploratory" talks with the trust but maintains the land isn't for sale. It has already gotten most of the clearances needed for the project and plans to break ground in the first quarter of 2010 and complete construction of 127 units—a mix of apartments, townhouses and single-family homes priced between $500,000 and $1 million—within three or four years. The company has pledged to create a nature walk open to the public.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(See Corrections &amp; Amplification item below[correction])</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. I'm 31-year-old lifelong renter. From working for a hedge fund for the last four years, I have $1.5 million in municipal bonds, the stock market, certificates of deposit and cash, and no hard assets other than my car. But considering the current environment for hedge funds, I foresee losing my job, which pays $150,000 annually. I'm thinking about purchasing real estate, so I can take advantage of mortgage tax breaks and stop paying rent. I'm thinking of buying about $2 million worth of property, possibly a single-family home and a multifamily unit, using about $600,000 for down payments. Do you think this is wise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Congratulations on having the discipline to save such a large amount of money in such a short time, and for investing it widely. Since real estate can help you hedge against downswings in these other investment classes--at least if you invest for the long term--I think you're wise to look into it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since you don't feel your job is secure, you may be better off if you continue renting for now--or at least scale down your buying ambitions--for several reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, you can deduct mortgage interest on your federal tax bill, but only for the first $1 million in home acquisition debt. Second, real estate is relatively illiquid in the best of times, and we are in the worst of times. Right now, should you lose your job suddenly and have to relocate, you could just end your lease and move. If you own one or more properties, you may have to sell at a loss or become a long-distance landlord, with all the stress, hassle and expense that this entails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the gap between the cost of renting and owning in San Francisco, which has been wide for many years. As a tenant, you're benefiting from this gap; as an owner, you lose out. For instance, on Trulia.com[http://Trulia.com], I recently saw a one-bedroom loft in the SoMa district listed for $499,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know you can afford to pay cash for such a property, but for the sake of comparison of owning and renting, let's assume you bought it as most buyers would, with 10% down, at 5% interest, with $1,000 annual tax and $300 annual insurance. Your monthly payment would be $2,519, but you'd only be able to command a rent of about $2,500 a month for the property, according to Zilpy.com[http://Zilpy.com], a Web site that uses nearby comps to estimate rental returns for specific properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, you can't count on appreciation to make up the difference. Property prices have fallen precipitously in San Francisco since the housing bubble burst, and many economists think the city won't start to recover until late this year or early next year. According to the latest Standard &amp; Poor's/Case Shiller[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124092346703363431.html#project%3DCASE_SHILLER090428%26articleTabs%3Dinteractive] home price index, in February existing single-family prices fell 31%, and condos 23%, from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, if you're sure you will stay in the area for the next few years, you might want to invest in real estate anyway. But, cautious and don't take on too much debt, considering your shaky job situation. I don't think you should buy $2 million worth of properties without feeling secure that your current income will continue or if you don't have much hope for positive cash flow or appreciation in the current economy. If something goes wrong, you'd soon have to raid your other savings to pay your hefty mortgage payments, even if you put $600,000 down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, I'd suggest that you buy a $500,000 to $600,000 foreclosed or short-sale duplex. Either pay cash, or finance the purchase with a down payment of at least 20% to avoid paying private mortgage insurance. These days, many such properties can be purchased at a huge discount over traditional sales, giving you instant equity and cushioning you against potential home price declines. Plus, you'll eliminate your rental payment and get some income from your tenant, making it less likely that you'll have to dip into your savings should you lose your job.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a single-family house fell 14% to $169,000 in the first quarter from a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group said first-time home buyers accounted for half of all purchases in the quarter, and many of them zeroed in on foreclosed homes. That dragged down the median, the Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for the latest quarter is down 26% from a peak of $227,600 in the third quarter of 2005. The latest median price was down from a year earlier in 134 of the 152 metro areas included in the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest increase was in the Cumberland area of Maryland and West Virginia, where the median price climbed 21% to $114,900. Debbie Grimm, manager of the <span class="companylink">Long &amp;Foster</span> real-estate brokerage in Cumberland, Md., said the area is attracting retirees and second-home buyers, particularly from Washington and Baltimore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lowest median price among the metro areas was $30,300 in Saginaw, Mich., and the highest was $570,000 in Honolulu. Most of the areas with the lowest prices are in troubled parts of the industrial Midwest. But a glut of homes in Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Fla., pushed the median down 59% from a year earlier to $87,300 -- ranking it just below Gary, Ind., which, at $92,000, was down 26%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes and condominiums declined 6.8% from a year earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.6 million units. But sales were up sharply in some areas hardest hit by the housing bust, largely because bargain hunters were out in force. States with big sales increases from the depressed levels of a year before included Nevada (up 117%), California (81%) and Arizona (50%) and Florida (25%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising unemployment and fears of more job losses are deterring many potential buyers. But others are encouraged by the lowest mortgage rates since the 1950s. In addition, the U.S. government is offering tax credits for certain home buyers before Dec. 1.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">April Drop In Listings For Homes</span>
</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>466 words</div><div>12 May 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale in many U.S. cities continued to fall in April in what some analysts see as a sign that the market may be nearing a bottom. But the picture is clouded by uncertainty over how many foreclosed properties will hit the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes for sale in 29 major metropolitan areas at the end of April was down 3.6% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The ZipRealty data cover all single-family homes, condominiums and town houses listed on local multiple-listing services in metro areas where the firm operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a national basis, inventories typically increase in April as for-sale signs bloom for the spring home-shopping season. Since 1982, the average increase in April from the prior month has been 4.8%, according to Zelman &amp;Associates, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with the year-earlier month, the April inventory in the 29 metro areas was down 21%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors says about 3.7 million homes were listed for sale nationwide at the end of March, down 10% from a year earlier. But that number doesn't include all of the foreclosed homes that banks aim to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, among the biggest owners of foreclosed homes, typically have only about 35% to 50% of those homes listed for sale at any given time, according to industry estimates. At one of the nation's largest banks, about 60% of the foreclosed homes are listed, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some foreclosed homes aren't listed because they are being offered for rental; others are awaiting repairs or are subject to litigation or other delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Lawler, a housing economist based in Leesburg, Va., says the decline in listings "suggests that the bottom in home prices is much closer than many pundits believe." He also notes that housing construction has plunged. But he cautions that it's unclear how many foreclosed homes will go on the market in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> estimates that banks and loan investors owned 765,500 foreclosed homes as of April 1, up from 629,100 a year earlier. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> forecasts that this inventory will peak at around 1.3 million homes in mid- to late-2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zip data don't cover New York City. But Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm there, reports there were 10,369 cooperative apartments and condominiums on the market in Manhattan at the end of April. That was down 0.7% from March but up 20% from April 2008.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Los Angeles Office Sale May Be a Loss Leader, if It Can Set a Bottom</span>
</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi   </div><div>845 words</div><div>6 May 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the dark and stormy commercial real-estate sales market, a deal involving a 42-story office tower in downtown Los Angeles may finally shine some light on how far values have fallen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viewed as one of the city's premier office buildings, the 992,000-square-foot glass-clad One California Plaza in the tony Bunker Hill neighborhood was put on the block in January by <span class="companylink">Macquarie Office Trust</span>, a battered Australia-based real estate investment trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property has attracted interest from a wide range of investors, but many of them lobbed in lowball bids. Others, like New York-based Emmes Group of Cos. and San Francisco-based Shorenstein Properties LLC have window-shopped but to date have passed on bidding, according to people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, the L.A. buzz is that CB Richard Ellis Investors, Los Angeles-based CommonWealth Partners and San Francisco's DivcoWest are also in the mix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is a deal, brokers believe it will be in the $200 million to $240 million range. Macquarie purchased an 80% stake in the building in 2006 in a deal that valued the property at $325 million. The seller was Los Angeles-based Maguire Properties, which retained ownership of 20% of the tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since there have been so few sales, the price of One California would be closely scrutinized as a harbinger of the losses sellers will need to take if they want to get cash out of prime downtown properties. While a few high-profile office buildings in other cities have sold, some for as little as half of their peak value, no large office buildings in downtown L.A. have traded hands this year, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York-based research firm. "Everybody's starved ... for people to actually buy," says Whitley Collins, senior managing director with <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> in Los Angeles. "Whether this is a bottom or not, people will feel better knowing there's some activity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A price of $240 million would mean a so-called capitalization rate in the 7.5% to 8% range, according to Michael Knott, a senior analyst at Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach, Calif. That is a closely watched metric used to value buildings derived by dividing a building's annual net operating income by the price paid. They have been on the rise nationwide in part because buyers can no longer assume rents will rise as they did at the market's peak. Deals completed in downtown L.A. at the market's peak saw cap rates in the low 5% range, Mr. Knott says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed by Arthur Erickson Architects and completed in 1985, One California has issues. It is only about 76% leased and its vacancies could grow as a number of leases are set to expire in the next few years, according to <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>. <span class="companylink">Bank of the West</span>, which occupies about 78,625 square feet of office space, is mulling options that include moving out of the building or staying on when its lease expires next year. The property also carries a mortgage that matures late next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook for the Los Angeles's downtown office market, popular with law firms and financial-service companies now facing pressures, has dimmed recently. Los Angeles's central business district's office market's vacancy increased to 10.4% in the first quarter from 9.8% the year earlier, though it is outperforming some harder hit markets like Orange County, where vacancy rates stood at 13.9%, according to CoStar Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Macquarie Office Trust</span> is a publicly traded property trust managed by the Sydney-based <span class="companylink">Macquarie Group</span>, a banking and financial-services company. It is facing some of the same stresses hitting its counterparts in the U.S. real-estate investment trust sector. The stock of the company, which owned about 42 properties in Australia, Europe, Japan and the U.S. as of December, has been battered as investors have been rattled by concerns about debt and falling real-estate values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, <span class="companylink">Macquarie Office</span> said it was undertaking a number of steps, including selling property, raising capital and reducing shareholder dividends to improve its balance sheet and shore up confidence. Those efforts have helped refinance or repay about 1.4 billion Australian dollars (US$1.04 billion) in debt that was to expire this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adrian Taylor, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Macquarie Office Trust</span>, said in an interview he expected that only one or two of the four properties it now has on the block in the U.S. will ultimately be sold. "We will sell assets where it makes sense but not at any price," Mr. Taylor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Macquarie is marketing the L.A. building as well as the <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Center in Denver, Chase Tower in Indianapolis and a fourth building at 745 Atlantic Avenue in Boston.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kate Haywood   </div><div>1186 words</div><div>6 May 2009</div><div>17:25</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The rally in credit seemed relentless Wednesday as gains in U.S. stocks and an unexpected increase in pending U.S. home sales gave markets a boost ahead of the government's bank stress-test results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as news reports pointed to significant capital needs by major banks ahead of the Thursday release of the results, investors appeared to be growing more confident about the viability of the financial sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the cost of protection on a basket of highly rated North American corporate bonds fell to levels not seen over seven months as benchmark credit derivatives indices outpaced positive equity markets in a broad-based rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>. were among a number of large U.S. banks that need to raise more capital after the completion of the government's stress tests, according to people familiar with the matter and reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>., American Express Co., <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Bank of New York Mellon Corp</span>., however, reportedly won't need to raise more money to shore up their balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tests weren't restricted to traditional banks. <span class="companylink">GMAC LLC</span> may have to raise as much as $11.5 billion of additional capital, according to news reports. However, <span class="companylink">MetLife Inc</span>. isn't expected to need more capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the leaks, there could still be some surprises for the market, according to Vivek Tawadey, head of credit portfolio strategy &amp; head of credit research at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the extent of the need for capital could prove to be a negative for the markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could be even more of a shock because it comes at a time "when most of the good news [both in terms of economic indicators and earnings] seem to have been priced in."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of previously owned homes, released Monday, rose 3.2% in March, while the Commerce Department said spending on construction projects that month rose by 0.3%, the first gain in six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junk Bonds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New issuance remained the theme in the high-yield market, where issuers have lined up to take advantage of the sector's ongoing rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After pricing Tuesday afternoon, the $4.225 billion of new <span class="companylink">Teck Resources</span> notes surged in secondary market trade, with all three tranches -- which priced between 94.65 and 95.25 cents on the dollar -- trading near par Wednesday, with some of the notes up as much as seven points, according to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goodyear is in the market with a planned seven-year note offering via joint bookrunners <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Goodyear deal is now expected in the range of $1 billion, up from an initially announced $500 million, and the timetable has been accelerated with pricing expected later Wednesday, according to two investors familiar with the deal. Price talk is in the area of a five-point discount to par and an 11.5% yield. Proceeds will go toward general corporate purposes, including repayment of $500 million of senior floating-rate notes due Dec. 1, 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Nalco Co</span>. priced $500 million of senior notes at a discounted price of 97.86 cents on the dollar to yield 8.625%. Proceeds from the offering, along with proceeds from a contemplated new term loan facility, will go toward repaying term loans outstanding under the company's existing senior secured credit facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonds traded higher in the secondary market, boosted by gains in lower-rated sectors such as auto parts makers and casinos. Gains in the high-yield CDX index, meanwhile, outpaced cash bonds, with the index up 1.6 points to 81.1, according to Markit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential Capital's senior unsecured bonds were sharply higher -- by as much as 12 points -- even though it became apparent that ResCap parent GMAC would need to raise more capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Ferguson, analyst at <span class="companylink">KDP Investment Advisors</span>, said that the reason behind the run-up wasn't completely clear as there hasn't been any particularly compelling news for ResCap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment-Grade Bonds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market saw a solid day of new bonds totaling around $5 billion, including $2 billion from <span class="companylink">General Electric Capital Corp</span>., the financing arm of <span class="companylink">General Electric Co</span>. These notes, unlike the bulk of deals from the company since autumn, didn't carry a guarantee from the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is favorable and there is demand for our paper," said spokesman Russell Wilkerson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proceeds of the deal will go toward the company's 2010 funding plan, he said. Underwriters on the deal are <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, according to another person familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial companies have relied heavily on the FDIC's guarantee program to sell debt at cheap rates since it started in the fall. But a few have gone outside the program, particularly in recent weeks, to sell non-guaranteed debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Electric Capital was one of the first companies to test the waters, and has sold $6.4 billion in non-FDIC backed debt since November, according to data provider Dealogic. During the same period, it sold $39.4 billion in guaranteed notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other issuers Wednesday included <span class="companylink">Rabobank Nederland</span>, <span class="companylink">Husky Energy</span> and Xerox.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, bank credit-default swaps tightened significantly as investors grew more confident that the stress tests won't result in any haircuts, or reductions, for bondholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark high-grade credit derivatives index, the Markit CDX IG12 is quoted at 144 basis points by CMA DataVision. It closed at 157 basis points Tuesday, according to Markit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agency mortgage-backed securities continued to firm up, though at a much more modest pace than in the past couple of days. Risk premiums were two basis points tighter over Treasurys yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve bought more of these securities than was available in the market. Also, investors expect prepayment speeds in April, to be announced Wednesday evening, to come in at 15%, a pace that indicates that homeowners aren't repaying as fast as was expected in the current refinancing regime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the refinance index has dropped to the low 5,000 levels for two straight weeks in a row, throwing off market participants' expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Information on how much the Fed dispersed to investors who applied for $10.6 billion in loans under its Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, program in the third round of such funding, which ended Tuesday, will be released May 14. The fourth loan application deadline is June 2. Issuance picks up around the loan application deadline and market participants are expecting the next round to be mammoth. This time around, issuance of consumer loan-backed bonds reached $13.5 billion ahead of the Tuesday deadline.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Encouraging Signs Seen in Housing, Construction</span>
</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans   </div><div>409 words</div><div>5 May 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increases in housing-market activity and construction spending were the latest signs of a brighter outlook for the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales of existing homes rose in March for the second-straight month, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. It marked the first back-to-back gains in that index in nearly a year, and the latest hopeful sign for the beleaguered housing market. Pending sales serve as a leading gauge, as they are based on contracts signed but not yet closed, a process that typically takes a month or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity was strongest in the South and West in March, the Realtors' group said, as the index overall increased 3.2 points from February to a level of 84.6. Sales of new and existing homes have fallen sharply in the past year, but have shown signs of life in recent months as falling prices and low mortgage rates help to make homes more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said Monday that spending on construction projects rose in March by 0.3% to $969 billion, the first gain in six months. Spending was down on residential construction but strong for nonresidential projects, particularly power plants and government structures, possibly reflecting a jump-start from the onset of the government's distribution of $787 billion of stimulus funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While both reports are encouraging, plenty of clouds remain on the horizon -- rising unemployment, in particular. The nation's 8.5% jobless rate is expected to jump toward 9% when April figures are released Friday by the Labor Department, and to flirt with double digits as layoffs continue to mount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nomura Securities chief economist David Resler wrote in a note to clients about construction spending: "We [still] expect that these expenditures will remain under considerable pressure this year due to rising vacancies and difficult financing conditions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the increase does suggest that the economy contracted at a slower rate than initially reported during the January-March period. The government last week reported that the economy contracted at a 6.1% annual rate in the first quarter. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economists said they expect that figure will be revised upward to a drop of 5.9%, and also raised their forecast for the current quarter to a drop of 3.3% from the 3.5% projected prior to Monday's reports.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Peter A. McKay and Rob Curran   </div><div>945 words</div><div>5 May 2009</div><div>03:39</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An across-the-board surge in stocks turned the broad Standard &amp; Poor's 500 positive for 2009 after data showed increased construction spending and pending-home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets have been marching higher for nearly two months, with the S&amp;P 500 gaining 34% since hitting its bear-market lows in early March. Data Monday that showed the first increase in construction spending in six months and a 3.2% jump in pending home sales gave stocks another shove.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 214.33 points, or 2.6%, to end at 8426.74, the highest close since Jan. 13. The blue-chip benchmark is now down just 4% for the year to date and has risen 29% since closing at a 12-year nadir of 6547.05 on March 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 jumped 29.72 points, or 3.4%, to 907.24 as a late burst of buying turned the benchmark positive for the year to date, up 0.4%. Its financial sector jumped 10%, and its basic-materials sector gained 5.6%. Investors snapped up energy and consumer stocks, as well betting that the economy bottomed out in the first quarter, when it shrank at a 6.1% seasonally adjusted annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Frejlich, a futures broker at Fox Investments in Chicago, said that there has been a marked change in investor sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've reached a point where the selloffs are short-lived," he said. "Even if you get a downdraft, it lasts a week or so, then you get a new high because people are looking for entry points to the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign of the economic optimism sweeping trading floors, crude-oil futures settled at $54.47 a barrel, the highest level this year. Crude has gained more than 9% in the last four trading days and is up 60% from its 2009 closing low of $33.98, hit on February 12, 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With stocks substantially above their worst levels for the current bear market, market watchers said that some investors were now feeling compelled to push funds into the market after missing out on the early part of the rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you're one of the big bears out there, you really have to worry that you haven't participated," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at <span class="companylink">Banyan Partners</span> in New York.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at brokerage thinkorswim, said many traders had expected the S&amp;P 500 to pull back after hitting the 870 level, but that hasn't happened. "A lot of people are getting caught short here," he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An increase in housing-market activity and a gain in construction spending were the latest signs of a brighter outlook for the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales of U.S. existing homes rose in March for the second-straight month, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. It marked the first back-to-back gains in that index in nearly a year, and the latest hopeful sign for the beleaguered housing market. Pending sales serve as a leading gauge of home sales, as they are based on contracts signed, but not yet closed, a process that typically takes a month or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity was strongest in the South and West in March, the Realtors' group said, as the index overall increased 3.2 points from February to a level of 84.6. Sales of new and existing homes have fallen sharply in the past year, but have shown signs of life in recent months, as falling prices and low mortgage rates are helping to make home buying more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said Monday that spending on construction projects rose in March by 0.3% to $969 billion, the first gain in six months. Spending was down on residential construction, but strong for nonresidential projects, particularly power plants and government structures, possibly reflecting a jump-start in spending as the government begins to distribute funds from its $787 billion stimulus package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While both reports were encouraging for the economy, there are still plenty of storm clouds on the horizon. Rising unemployment, in particular, threatens to damp the outlook: The nation's 8.5% unemployment rate is expected to jump toward 9% when April figures are released Friday by the Labor Department, and to flirt with double digits as layoffs continue to mount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nomura Securities chief economist David Resler wrote in a note to clients about construction spending: "We [still] expect that these expenditures will remain under considerable pressure this year due to rising vacancies and difficult financing conditions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the increase does suggest the U.S. economy contracted at a slower rate than initially reported during the January-through-March period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government last week reported the U.S. economy contracted at a 6.1% annual rate in the first quarter, as sharply lower spending on new building projects, in particular, weighed on growth. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economists said they expect that figure will be revised upward to a drop of 5.9%, and they also raised their forecast for the current quarter to a drop of 3.3% from a decline of 3.5% prior to the release of Monday's reports.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jon Hilsenrath and Kelly Evans </div><div>397 words</div><div>5 May 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although credit conditions remain strained, an April survey of loan officers by the Federal Reserve found a smaller number of banks were continuing to tighten loan standards, compared with a few months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glimmers of improvement were most notable in commercial lending. The Fed said 40% of the 53 domestic banks it surveyed between March 31 and April 14 said they tightened standards on commercial and industrial loans, a smaller percentage than the 65% that said in January that they tightened standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The April survey marks the first time since January 2008 that the proportion of banks reporting such tightening fell below 50%," the central bank said. When banks tighten standards, they make it harder to get a loan by toughening certain criteria, such as for income, cash flow or indebtedness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the period, banks were also a little less aggressive about demanding more for the loans they actually made. Some 80% said they toughened terms on loans -- for instance, increasing the interest rate -- when compared with some benchmark. That was down from the 95% that said in January they demanded a higher rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 65% of banks said they tightened standards for commercial real-estate loans, down from 80% in January. It was the first time since October 2007 that the percentage of banks tightening standards on commercial real-estate loans fell below 70%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer lending was mixed. While there was a greater percentage of banks tightening criteria for mortgage loans, the percentage doing so for home equity and certain other consumer loans eased a bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, increases in housing-market activity and construction spending were the latest signs of a brighter outlook for the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales of existing homes rose in March for the second straight month, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. It marked the first back-to-back gains in that index in nearly a year, and the latest hopeful sign for the housing market.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Total U.S. construction spending rose for the first time in six months in March, beating analyst expectations as public-sector outlays increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a forecasting gauge of home sales rose more than expected in March, buoyed by first-time home buyers taking advantage of lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. construction spending rose 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $969.7 billion during the month, the Commerce Department reported Monday. Analysts had expected construction spending would fall by 1.3% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. construction spending has been falling since September, taking with it thousands of construction jobs. It has fallen more than 11% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In revising February's construction-spending estimates, the Commerce Department on Monday said spending fell 1.0%, slightly more than its original estimate of a 0.9% drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, residential-construction spending fell 4.1% to $265.85 billion. Residential spending fell a revised 5.6% in February, up from the Commerce Department's original estimate of a 4.1% drop. It was down 33.3% from March 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending in the nonresidential sector rose 2.0% in March as spending for educational and power facilities rose while spending on office construction remained fairly steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-sector construction spending fell 0.1% in March to $661.0 billion and a revised 2.1% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public-sector construction spending by state and federal governments rose 1.1% in March to $308.7 billion. Public-sector spending was up a revised 1.3% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of previously owned homes rose 3.2% to 84.6 from a revised 82.0 in February, the industry group said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private analysts had projected that pending sales would grow 1.0% during March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Lawrence Yun, the association's chief economist, said it is too early to declare a recovery in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This increase could be the leading edge of first-time buyers responding to very favorable affordability conditions and an $8,000 tax credit, which increases buying power even more in areas where special programs allow buyers to use it as a down payment," Mr. Yun said in a statement. "We need several months of sustained growth to demonstrate a recovery in housing, which is necessary for the overall economy to turn around."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending-sales index, based on signed contracts for previously owned homes, was 1.1% above the level of 83.7 in March 2008.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>.'s fiscal second-quarter loss narrowed as the home builder said market conditions remain challenging as inventories surge amid rising foreclosures unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> dropped 3.9% to $12.97 in after-hours trading as results fell short of estimates. Shares have soared 90% in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders, which have posted a string of losses, have seen their turnaround efforts mired by tighter credit practices and poor consumer confidence. The industry has struggled to unload inventory, as many builders compete with bargain-priced foreclosed homes, and have pinned their hope on the success of stimulus initiatives. Meanwhile, companies have written off billions of dollars in prior spending and assets as values slumped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But optimism is mounting that the bottom is near. The National Association of Realtors reported Monday that its pending Home Sales Index increased, helped as property prices fall, more than 50% from their peak in some markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended March 31, <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> reported a loss of $108.6 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $1.31 billion, or $4.14 a share. The latest results included $48.1 million in pretax charges, compared with $834.1 million in the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue slumped 52% to $775.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters projected a per-share loss of 30 cents on revenue of $817 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closings fell 47% to 3,585 homes. At March 31, the company's sales backlog of homes under contract was 4,581 valued at $963 million, down from 8,947 and $2.1 billion, respectively. Net sales orders fell 45% to 4,160 homes, and the cancellation rate was 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said as of March 31, it was in compliance with all covenants associated with its home building revolving credit facility and had $275 million available under its borrowing base. The company said it doesn't anticipate having to borrow from the facility for the remainder of its term ending in December 2011, so the company decided to terminate the facility effective May 11, which should save over $3 million a year in nonuse fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> has long been the nation's largest residential builder by volume, but <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes Inc</span>.'s proposed combination with Centex Corp. will usurp <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>'s No. 1 position.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[As the spring auctions begin, the stock market is rallying. But collectors and dealers are treading warily.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> stunned the art world three years ago by selling a single painting by Pablo Picasso for nearly $100 million. On Tuesday, the auction house says it will need to sell everything in its evening sale of Impressionist art to hit that mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next two weeks, New York's chief auction houses -- <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span>, Christie's International and the smaller Phillips de Pury &amp;Co. -- will try to protect price levels for dozens of the world's top artists at their semiannual sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art. With the recession hitting home among wealthy collectors, the auction houses are bracing for one of their toughest seasons in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The auction catalogs alone weigh half as much as those from three years ago. <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> expects to bring in between $179 million and $256 million at the spring sales, down from $411 million at its auctions last fall and $742 million last spring. The priciest work in the house's contemporary sale: Jeff Koons's sculpture, "Baroque Egg With Bow (Turquoise/Magenta)," which has an estimate of about $6 million. <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> got nearly four times as much for a Koons sculpture from the same series two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These sales come at a crucial moment for the art market. For the past seven years, an influx of newly wealthy buyers from around the world has spurred art prices to record highs, with artists like Francis Bacon, Mark Rothko and Andy Warhol commanding prices above $70 million. Prices kept climbing even after the credit crisis began in 2007, as collectors shifted assets from ailing housing and stock markets into tangible assets like gold and art -- a pattern that has historically caused the art market to lag behind other financial markets by at least a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the fall auctions in November, art sales pulled back sharply, and a Bacon painting priced at $40 million, along with dozens of other works, went unsold. Since year's end, buyers have been circumspect, some galleries have closed and contemporary art values have dropped by a third, almost as much as the record 41% drop during the last art crash of 1991, says economist Michael Moses. (By contrast, in the last two months, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed nearly 16%.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At next week's auctions, strong sales could restore confidence throughout the global art market, but that confidence could be shaken further if collectors think the estimates are slightly high or the offerings remotely inferior. Another drop could further hamper the auction houses' ability to attract the masterpieces that appeal to their top clients, according to art adviser Allan Schwartzman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roster of artists up for sale has shifted dramatically this season, as auction houses have steered away from some whose prices soared during the recent boom, making them more vulnerable to precipitous drops. Works by Bacon and other contemporary stars like Lucian Freud have been left out of the sales entirely this time around. The contemporary evening sales include only one work each by Mark Rothko and Damien Hirst, the latter priced at around $350,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the auctioneers have sought out more-subtle works by lesser-known artists who are popular with curators in hopes that museums or seasoned collectors will bid. Conceptual sculptor Robert Gober, whose works are collected by institutions such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is featured prominently in major contemporary auctions of two houses. Phillips is offering an untitled Gober sculpture of an oversized box of Farina wheat cereal with a low estimate of $2.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This potential shift in taste -- from celebrity art to cerebral art -- will be tested when <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> offers up German fashion designer Wolfgang Joop's group of 10 works by Tamara de Lempicka, a Polish artist whose slinky portraits of Art Deco-era women have been collected by Madonna and Barbra Streisand. The group is led by "Portrait de Marjorie Ferry," a view of a woman with golden ringlets clutching a toga-like sheet that's priced to sell for at least $4 million. Christie's, meanwhile, has its own Lempicka with "Portrait de Madame M," priced to sell for at least $6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The auctions do feature a few blockbuster works that the houses hope will be big sellers. <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> expects to get at least $16 million apiece for Alberto Giacometti's spindly sculpture of a cat, "Le chat," and Picasso's 1938 portrait of his toddler daughter, "La fille de l'artiste a deux ans et demi avec un bateau." Christie's expects to make anywhere from $210 million to $310 million by selling works such as Picasso's 1968 portrait of a musketeer, "Mousquetaire a la pipe," for at least $12 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The auction houses say they tightly edited their sales and rejected works whenever sellers insisted on boom-era prices, which they say explains the smaller sales. Dealers say the auction houses are simply struggling to find enough material at any price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Sutton, a senior research analyst who tracks the auction industry for Craig-Hallum Capital Group in Minneapolis, says buyers may no longer want to flaunt their fortunes with status art, a recession-era taboo that could affect these sales. "No one wants to be the only guy buying a big boat right now," Mr. Sutton said. "Does that also apply to big paintings?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jose Mugrabi, a major collector and dealer of contemporary art, is treading cautiously. He says he decided not to consign any works to the higher-stakes evening sales this time but has consigned around a dozen works by artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Tom Wesselman to the day sales. "I'd like to see a little more what will happen in the market first," Mr. Mugrabi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The auction houses typically go into marketing overdrive to offset any presale jitters, but their efforts this season have been complicated by budget cuts and layoffs. Earlier this week, <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> said it was reducing its dividend, instituting unpaid furloughs and cutting 5% of its staff. It already cut 15% of its work force last fall. Beginning today, at least four top executives, including chief financial officer Bill Sheridan, are taking pay cuts of up to $60,000 each from their salaries, according to regulatory filings. Christie's, which is closely held, cut around 300 jobs last fall and is consolidating smaller departments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Austere times have meant that specialists have had to cut back on the traveling exhibitions that typically give bidders around the world a sneak peek at dozens of sale offerings. <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> says it has also pared its catalog mailing list, directing less-active buyers to its Web site or sending them a USB drive loaded with a digital version of the catalog instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time in several years, auction houses have been virtually unable to win consignments by paying sellers for artwork upfront using financial arrangements called guarantees. With a guarantee, the auction house essentially assumes the seller's risk by pledging a price whether or not the artwork sells. The strategy backfired last fall, when auctioneers lost roughly $60 million after guaranteed artworks went unsold. This time, only three artworks carry such pledges. <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> executives allowed their contemporary specialists to guarantee paintings by Christopher Wool and Martin Kippenberger only after locking down promised bids from buyers beforehand, a device called an irrevocable bid. Christie's, meanwhile, got outside investors to stake its lone guarantee for the $12 million Picasso.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding sellers willing to put their artworks up for sale at a time when prices are likely to be low also proved a major challenge for auction houses this season. To compensate, the houses moved aggressively to secure art consignments from the estates of collectors who have died in recent years. Artworks in estate collections can sell well at auction because they've been off the market for a while -- and often need to be sold quickly to satisfy estate-related tax deadlines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christie's landed the plum estate of Los Angeles collector Betty Freeman this season, after an elaborate courtship that involved Christie's specialists and top executives making trips to California over a six-week period. The auction house also faced stiff competition from the Gagosian Gallery to win the consignment, according to Brett Gorvy, Christie's international co-head of contemporary art. "In the past you won because you dazzled with guarantees or big estimates," Mr. Gorvy said, "but now the governing rule is relationships."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christie's is also selling a painting by Henri Matisse and other works from the estate of department-store heiress Caral Gimbel Lebworth. Ms. Lebworth's daughter, Alva Greenberg, says the decision to sell at Christie's fell largely to "intuition," since both major houses offered similar marketing plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for Piet Mondrian's grid works also remains high, particularly following their profitable showing during Christie's sale of Yves Saint Laurent's estate three months ago. <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> is offering a 1934 example, "Composition in Black and White, with Double Lines," for at least $3 million. Buzz is also strong for Philip Guston's "Anxiety," a 1975 depiction of a black telephone and a bacon-and-egg sandwich. (The artist famously hated the first and loved the latter.) Phillips is offering it for at least $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will collectors take the bait? Possibly. Art experts don't expect much bidding from the young titans from Russia, Asia and the Middle East who socked their new wealth into art last year, because so many took big financial hits as the economic crisis worsened. Yet buyers from these so-called emerging markets have nevertheless maintained their appetite for jewelry and watches, so they could renew their art habit as the economy recovers. Art sales in Hong Kong and design sales in London have also been surprisingly robust in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the field belongs mainly to American and European collectors, notably the postwar generation who sit on museum boards and closely scrutinize the merits and pricing of what's on offer, dealers say. In the past, some of these buyers felt sidelined but may now seize the chance to buy without as much competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a different world now," says Richard Polsky, a longtime private dealer in Sausalito, Calif. "The auction houses don't care what the works sell for -- they just need it to sell so they can prove the art market is still alive."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many developers of resort Caribbean real estate, David Johnson is facing the daunting challenge these days of selling ultraluxury Caribbean property at a time when the economy is tanking and buyers are in retreat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he is getting some help from a powerful ally: the government of the British Virgin Islands, which has agreed to ease some restrictions on foreign real-estate buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Qualified buyers willing to pay $2 million to $25 million for a lot in Mr. Johnson's Oil Nut Bay, an 88-home, low-density development under construction in Virgin Gorda, will benefit from a new 90-day automatic approval for a landholder license. The government also is expanding the local airport and is providing better cellular service and high-speed wireless access for smart-phone use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The government realized, given the current economic climate and given that we live by tourism, that we want to have these investors come in," says Clyde Lettsome, permanent secretary for the Ministry of Natural Resources and Labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As property markets fall world-wide, one of the few consolations for real-estate investors is that some governments have become more open to nonresident property owners. A growing number of them are considering loosening or temporarily suspending foreign property-ownership restrictions in a bid to stimulate their real-estate markets. In January, for example, Beijing issued a one-year suspension of a one-year residency requirement for foreign nationals buying a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cayman Islands and Australia have also recently loosened their rules. Meanwhile, the issue is being discussed in numerous other countries, including the Philippines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loosening foreign-investment restrictions isn't new. Governments have been attempting to stimulate foreign investment for years in response to swelling interest from international investors. In 2005, India began letting foreigners invest directly in Indian residential and commercial real-estate development. And in late 2006, the government lifted a required 10-year lock-in period on repatriating property sale proceeds, although it's limited to $1 million a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slumping property sales has given the issue renewed urgency, as countries strive to find ways to stimulate local economies. Last month, the historically foreign-investment-friendly government of the Cayman Islands temporarily lowered rates on their real-estate transfer "stamp duty" taxes, including a reduction to 5% from 7.5% on waterfront property. At the same time, the country's real-estate brokers group, Cayman Islands Real Estate Brokers Association, announced a 20% rebate on commissions. The discounts last through Sept. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restrictions on foreign ownership exist mainly in emerging property markets. Most Western European countries, including the U.K., France and Italy, don't restrict foreign nationals from owning real estate. (Notable exceptions are Switzerland and Austria, which have established some foreign-buyer quotas to keep prices down in some ski towns.) The U.S. doesn't restrict foreigners from buying property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ways to restrict foreign investment aside from outright bans include high transfer taxes and limits on when and how much money investors can repatriate. Rules can differ depending whether the purchase is a residence or an investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, not all countries are choosing to loosen regulations. Some may crack down on foreign investment, blaming it for driving prices to unsustainable levels, says Danny Bance, managing partner of U.K.-based International Property Investment Network, a research and investment services provider for investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many governments believe that foreign investment spurs infrastructure development, which spurs economic opportunity, says Mr. Johnson, 59 years old, of Detroit, who got his start developing luxury property in Michigan, including a large Lake Michigan resort. He says he helped convince the British Virgin Islands government to loosen curbs on foreign investment partly through his willingness to hire local residents for senior management positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil Nut Bay is Mr. Johnson's biggest solo project and his first in the Caribbean. He bought the undeveloped 300-acre peninsula in 2006 for an undisclosed price and has spent millions on infrastructure, roads, electricity, the arrival dock, the beach club and other structures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet sales are slow. After about four months of marketing, he says he has sold about eight lots of the roughly 45 for sale at "founders" prices, ranging from $1.9 million for a "ridge villa" one-acre lot to $25 million for 10 acres with 360-degree views. Nevertheless, he says he isn't strapped for funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil Nut Bay's beach club is slated for completion in December and construction costs are expected to total $500 million for the full project, including what buyers will pay to build their houses and the cost of shipping in 5,000 metric tons of sand to create a sandy beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is still a market for unique, luxury development, Mr. Johnson says, despite the recession. He admits, however, that there are fewer buyers than there used to be. He notes: "If we had 1,000 units [to sell], I would be scared to death."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's housing-market slump showed hints of improvement in March, with sales of existing single-family homes increasing 64% from a year earlier and median home prices rising month-to-month for the first time since August 2007, according to a trade group report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's inventory of unsold homes in March fell to a three-year low of five months, according to a report released Monday by the California Association of Realtors. That compares with 12.2 months of inventory the group reported for March 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state saw sales of 522,980 existing single-family homes in March, compared with 319,290 in the year-earlier period, the report said. The March median price of $253,000 was up from $247,590 in February 2009 but down 39% from March 2008 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stimulus efforts helped the state's home sales in the month, said Delores Conway, a professor at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What will the housing landscape be like when the current pain ends?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I realize that may seem like a premature question since the bottom of the market has yet to be reached. That was the conclusion offered by 10 prominent housing analysts at the National Association of Home Builders' semiannual Construction Forecast Conference in Washington on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though they were targeting their remarks to an audience of home builders and remodelers, from their data and observations, I began to form a picture of what the post-recession world might be like for homeowners, buyers and sellers. Here are some of their predictions for the housing industry, and my own for consumers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say: The end (of declines) is near. While new home sales show signs of stabilizing as builders cut back on building and boom-bloated inventories are slowly absorbed, prices of both new and existing homes are still being dragged down by a flood of foreclosures. Still, the experts were optimistic that the federal government's efforts to stem foreclosures eventually will have an effect by the end of this year or early next year; Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, even ventured (jokingly) a date when home prices would stop falling—December 15, 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My take: It'll be a while. While prices may rise gradually by year's end, and bidding wars occur sporadically for especially desirable or underpriced properties, it will take a long time for most buyers to stop low-balling offers or asking for concessions -- just as it took many sellers months after the boom had ended in 2005 to realize that they no longer had the upper hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say: People won't invest as much in their homes. Job shocks, shrunken 401(k)s and declining equity have changed both what consumers have to spend and what they want to spend on their homes. Eric Belsky, executive director at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies in Cambridge, Mass., showed that the four-quarter moving rate of change on remodeling spending, up 4% in the first quarter of 2007, was down 7.5% in the first quarter of this year. He projected it would fall 12.3% by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My take: The analysts seem on target here. Consumers who plan to stay in their homes for a few years will spend what's necessary for comfort, or to keep the roof from leaking, but will abandon status upgrades, like bathrooms big enough to host a cocktail party. Those who plan to sell will still need to make cosmetic improvements to keep their house competitive, like putting in granite countertops if that's the standard for the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say: The credit freeze will thaw. The federal government's recent actions to streamline borrowing procedures, combined with mortgage interest rates that have hit 50-year lows, have re-energized borrowers seeking loans—or at least those borrowers with jobs and good credit histories that can pass the extremely tight standards that lenders now impose on borrowers. But even borrowers with some blemishes on their credit records may be able to get loans soon. "We will see some easing of lending standards," predicts Maury Harris, managing director and chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">UBS Investment Bank</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My take: Crisis breeds stasis, especially for those who are fearful of job loss. From December 2007 to March 2009, 5.06 million jobs were lost, and until that bleeding stops—something the assembled experts agreed would be unlikely to happen before the second half of the year—most people won't be tempted to take on extra debt or commitments. The Mortgage Bankers Association (not represented at the conference), expects total loan production to be up 69% to $2.73 trillion this year from the year before. But $1.93 trillion of that is expected to be refinancing of existing loans. Loans to buy new homes are expected to drop 6% from 2008 levels, to $806 billion. If their projections are right, that will be an added drag on housing's recovery, since people who have just refinanced their loans have a financial incentive—and probably have made a psychological commitment--to stay where they are.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty   </div><div>954 words</div><div>24 April 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yale University economist Robert Shiller has often dazzled audiences with a chart showing home prices from 1890 to present. Someone even used Mr. Shiller's chart to make a <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> video that puts its viewer on a roller-coaster ride over peaks and valleys in home pricing. It's a bumpy ride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now another economist, Thomas Lawler, says Prof. Shiller's chart is "bogus." Mr. Lawler says Mr. Shiller cobbled together data that are inconsistent and sometimes unreliable. Mr. Shiller defends his work and accuses Mr. Lawler of making "wild allegations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clash is more than just a spat between two of America's most prominent housing mavens. It could affect the debate about exactly where the U.S. is in its housing cycle. The squabble also illustrates the paucity of reliable information on house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they rely too heavily on house-price gauges, politicians may get a distorted view of the severity of the slump and support overly drastic measures, says Kenneth Rosen, a housing economist at the University of California, Berkeley. Mr. Lawler says the Shiller chart also appears to understate the long-run rate of increase in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one has found a precise way to measure changes in house prices. Because no two homes are exactly alike, changes in the price of one won't necessarily be matched even by apparently similar homes nearby, much less those hundreds of miles away. Though some indexes track price changes in the same set of houses over time, those can be distorted by major improvements in some of the houses and deterioration in others. The publicly recorded transaction prices, used to create indexes, often are distorted by incentives given to buyers that aren't tallied in the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that doesn't stop analysts from extrapolating from what may be dubious data. In a March 30 report, T2 Partners LLC, a New York hedge-fund manager, drew on the Shiller chart to conclude that on average U.S. home prices need to drop another 13% to get back in line with the long-term trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawler has created an adjusted version of the Shiller chart, backing up his view that house prices already are nearing a bottom in much of the country. A T2 partner called Mr. Lawler's critique "valid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While updating his book "Irrational Exuberance" in 2004, Mr. Shiller says he was surprised to find little data on long-term house-price trends. So he spliced together his own chart from various price indexes and studies. He conceded that the chart was "imperfect," but added that "it appears to be the best that can be found for this long time period."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 1890 to 1934, Mr. Shiller used data from a trio of economists led by Leo Grebler. Because he found no index for 1934 through 1953, Mr. Shiller wrote, "I had my research assistants fill that gap by tabulating prices in for-sale-by-owner ads in old newspapers," covering just five cities. For 1953 through 1975, Mr. Shiller used an index compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS. An index from the regulator of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> covers the period through 1986, after which Mr. Shiller uses the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index he created with another economist, Karl Case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In other words," Mr. Lawler wrote in a recent edition of his daily housing-market newsletter, "the long-term chart is based on a concatenation of different time series of home prices which use different methodologies, have different samples, measure different things, and all in all are, well, different."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawler, a former <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> economist who now is an independent consultant in Leesburg, Va., says the BLS data used by Mr. Shiller was based on a "very small sample" and so isn't reliable. Mr. Shiller's chart shows that home prices from 1940 through 2000 rose at an annual real, or inflation-adjusted, rate of 0.7%. Data from the Census Bureau, however, puts the real rate at 2.3% for that period. Part of the difference may be due to improvements in the quality of homes, Mr. Lawler says, but he doubts that accounts for the whole gap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shiller responds in an email that much of the difference "is indeed caused by quality change." He cites Census data showing that nearly a third of American homes lacked running water in 1940.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price indexes all have their flaws. The various S&amp;P/Case-Shiller indexes are limited to 20 metro areas and lately have been heavily affected by sales of foreclosed homes, whose prices reflect banks' need to dump assets quickly. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, or FHFA, index (formerly known as the Ofheo index) is based only on homes financed with loans owned or guaranteed by government-backed mortgage investors <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>; that excludes most homes recently bought with subprime loans,understating the damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Measurement is more an art than a science," says Mr. Lawler. He favors more government spending on house-price data. For now, Mr. Lawler says, the government does a better job with its monthly index of pricing for women's undergarments than it does with housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the criticism, Mr. Shiller's long-run chart is unlikely to fade away. Rich Hodge, a Web site developer in Simi Valley, Calif., who used Mr. Shiller's chart two years ago to create his <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> roller-coaster video, stands by the economist. Says Mr. Hodge: "He's a pretty accurate guy."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes sales continued their slide and companies kept shedding jobs in March, underscoring the economy's weakness in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the pace of economic decline has slowed since the steep drops at the end of last year and beginning of this year. Home sales and jobs data have exhibited an up-and-down pattern that has given some economists hope of a bottom to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It wasn't necessarily more bad news, but it certainly wasn't better news either," said Adam York, an economist at <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes declined 3% in March, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.57 million units, and the prior months' sales were revised downward, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing inventory remains high, and the market is still being driven by distressed sales, such as foreclosures, representing about half the existing-home sales in March. Both high inventories and distressed sales push down prices. The median existing home price was $175,200, down 12.4% from March 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were some signs that falling prices and low mortgage rates are drawing first-time home buyers into the market: The NAR said that first-time buyers accounted for roughly half of the existing-home sales in March. Still, some economists stressed that with a 10-month supply of unsold homes and such a high volume of foreclosure sales, the real-estate market will remain stressed through this year and into the next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If buyers are tentatively walking back into the marketplace, it's certainly a positive sign," said <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>'s Mr. York. "But the market remains under extreme stress."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, two indicators showed that employers continue to shed jobs, and that people without jobs are having a difficult time finding work. Claims for unemployment insurance rose last week, and there were more layoffs of 50 or more workers in March than in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for unemployment insurance rose by 27,000 to 640,000 last week, returning much of the improvement in the week-earlier period, according to the Labor Department. The number of people drawing unemployment insurance rose to about 6.1 million in the week ended April 11, from six million the previous week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on unemployment insurance are volatile by nature, so economists tend to track the averages -- and there were some mildly positive signs on that front. The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance fell to 647,000 from 651,000. "A definite improvement but not enough to feel confident that claims have peaked," said economists from <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department also reported that in March employers had 2,933 mass layoffs -- defined as a single employer letting go at least 50 workers -- costing about 300,000 workers their jobs. The bulk of layoffs were in the manufacturing sector, and the seasonally adjusted data represented an increase of 164 mass layoffs over the previous month's total.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Brett Arends   </div><div>651 words</div><div>24 April 2009</div><div>10:19</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is real estate cheap yet - or is it still expensive?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe it's both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data from the National Association of Realtors, which rattled nerves on Wall Street this week, showed national home sales are still weak. But they also showed how home sellers nationwide have split into two camps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call them "the haves" and the "don't haves." As in: Those who have to sell, and those who don't have to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The haves are the distressed sales. These include those in foreclosure, and those in pre-foreclosure "short sales." Such sales are now booming - at bargain prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, those who don't have to sell are often hanging on to 2006 prices. And they are hanging on to their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices aren't dropping. And homes aren't selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This could be ominous. It suggests - though it does not prove - that another shoe could be about to drop in real estate, as those who don't have to sell realize they need to compete more aggressively with those who do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest housing numbers tell a story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Realtors, there were 360,000 second-hand (aka "existing") home sales last month. As the headlines noted, that was down about from a year ago, when sales were 375,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But remarkably, distressed sales - foreclosures plus short sales -- now account for more than half of all turnover nationwide.The figure was 53% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the first month that has gone over 50%," says Realtors association spokesman Walter Molony. "It was stable for five months at about 45%."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means March saw about 190,000 forced sales. No wonder prices are in free fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, says Mr. Molony, distressed sales made up just 18% of the 375,000 transactions. That's about 68,000 sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, the number of distressed sales has nearly tripled in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the good news. That's a market clearing, at last. Distressed sales are taking place at prices at least 20% below the rest, the association says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, look at those who aren't in foreclosure or a short sale. They're selling their homes while still solvent. This used to be called the normal housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices haven't come down much. In some premium neighborhoods they have may even be rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the volume of those "normal" sales is down sharply. They make up just 47% of 360,000 second-hand home sales. That's 169,000 transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How little is that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even a year ago, when the housing market was already in the tank, these non-distressed sales accounted for 82% of 375,000 second-hand home sales nationwide. Or 308,000 transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's like the old joke about the man with the million dollar dog ("Well, I haven't sold him yet!").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a real estate market collapses, volumes die first. Prices fall later. So news that volumes are drying up for non-distressed sales has to be an ominous sign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who live in premium neighborhoods often fancy that they are immune from the slump. "Oh, good quality will hold up," they say. It's true good quality may hold up for awhile. But that doesn't mean anyone's immune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And over long terms, different real estate markets have to maintain some reasonably persistent connections. Otherwise many people would move to the cheaper neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade now -- in theory, at least -- may be to sell the place in an upscale neighborhood like Pacific Heights in San Francisco, if you can, and buy a foreclosure deal out in the 'burbs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Existing-home sales in the U.S. dropped in March, and the median price was down 12% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales fell by 3% to a 4.57 million annual rate from 4.71 million in February, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. The NAR originally reported February sales rose 5.1% to 4.72 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About half of the 4.57 million in March sales were foreclosures and short sales. The large number of these distressed-property sales has driven prices lower, year over year. The median price for an existing home in the U.S. last month was $175,200, down 12.4% from $200,100 in March 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, new U.S. claims for state unemployment benefits rose last week, while the total number of people drawing unemployment benefits surged to the highest level on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise comes after the Labor Department reported an unexpected plunge last week that had offered a ray of hope that the job market could be finding its footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for state jobless benefits grew 27,000 to 640,000 in the week ended April 18, the Labor Department said in a weekly report Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Labor Department analyst said Thursday's report was no surprise. "It's actually pretty uneventful," he said. "Most of the states are doing what we expected."</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>1293 words</div><div>23 April 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling home prices are starting to ignite bidding wars in a few parts of the U.S. as first-time buyers compete with investors for the same foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most of the nation, the supply of unsold homes continues to swamp demand. Home prices in many markets continue to fall, and foreclosures, which slowed in late 2008 as mortgage companies delayed taking action against delinquent borrowers, are picking up again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But real-estate brokers say multiple offers on certain homes have recently become more common in parts of California and Arizona and the Washington, D.C., and Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tamby Leonard of Santa Ana, Calif., southeast of Los Angeles, says she has been outbid four times since January when trying to buy a home for her family of five. The more appealing bank-owned homes in her price range, around $300,000, tend to be sold quickly to investors who can pay cash. The market for homes in the Santa Ana area in that price range is "blazing hot," says Ed Mixon of Altera Real Estate, Ms. Leonard's agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency reported that home prices nationwide rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7% in February from January, led by gains on the West Coast. When compared with a year earlier, however, home prices were down 6.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding wars -- common during the housing boom -- had all but disappeared soon after the market peaked about three years ago. Even now, they remain the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of 28 major metro areas shows that there is still a glut of homes available in most markets. But the glut has shrunk, and some areas are running into shortages of moderately priced homes in middle-class neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many housing economists expect the market to bottom out gradually over the next couple of years, with some parts of the country stabilizing well before others. California and Washington, D.C., for instance, are likely to recover faster than South Florida, which has an immense glut of vacant condominiums, and the New York City area, which has been hurt by Wall Street's collapse, says Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the nation, there is still a tug of war between bullish and bearish forces. On the bullish side, falling prices and the lowest mortgage rates since the 1950s have made homes far more affordable, luring shoppers like Ms. Leonard, who has been renting for years. Adding to the attraction, the U.S. government is offering tax credits for certain people who buy homes before Dec. 1. The credit -- equal to 10% of the purchase price, up to a maximum of $8,000 -- is available to buyers who haven't owned any other primary residence in the U.S. during the three years before the date of purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the bearish side, rising unemployment has knocked many people out of the housing market and made those who still have jobs skittish. Even those with secure jobs who want to buy can't always get loans on attractive terms because of today's tightened credit standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the supply of bank-owned homes is expected to grow over the next few months because many mortgage companies have ended moratoriums during which they refrained from proceeding with foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moratoriums artificially reduced the supply of foreclosed homes listed for sale, says Chad Neel, president of LPS Asset Management Solutions Inc. in Westminster, Colo., which sells such properties for banks. Now "there's a flood about to come on the market," Mr. Neel says. Foreclosures are likely to weigh on the market for years as courts and mortgage companies struggle to catch up with huge backlogs of unresolved cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures, though far above normal levels in most of the country, are heavily concentrated in a few states, including California, Arizona, Nevada, Florida and Michigan. In areas with large numbers of bank-owned homes, buyers are mainly concentrating on those properties. That leaves ordinary homes languishing as owners generally refuse to slash prices enough to compete with banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Sacramento, Calif., metro area, about two-thirds of all March sales were foreclosures, says Michael Lyon, chief executive of Lyon Real Estate. The supply of foreclosed homes currently listed for sale is enough to last only about a month at the recent sales pace, he calculates. But there are plenty of homes listed for sale that aren't bank-owned, enough to last more than eight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In West Sacramento, a buyer represented by Cherie Hunt of <span class="companylink">Prudential California Realty</span> recently competed against two other bidders for a three-bedroom home built in 2001. Ms. Hunt's buyer won by agreeing to pay about $220,000, or nearly $10,000 above the asking price. But that's still way down from $405,000, the price at which the same home sold in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have 20 buyers looking desperately," says Ms. Hunt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Borges LLosa, owner of FranklyRealty.com, a real-estate brokerage in Arlington, Va., is advising clients that banks favor all-cash bids or offers from people who seem certain to qualify for financing. Sellers may well choose the offer least likely to fall through rather than the highest bid, he says. He and other brokers say banks appear to be deliberately setting asking prices low in some cases to provoke bidding battles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a lot of buyers who think they can lowball," says Connie Vaughn, an agent at ZipRealty in the Los Angeles area. But in some cases mortgage companies already have cut asking prices enough to generate multiple bids. One of her clients recently prevailed over more than 30 other bidders by offering about $86,000 -- or $20,000 above the asking price -- for a four-bedroom house in Adelanto, Calif., that had sold for $200,000 in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mortgage company recently slashed the asking price on a two-family home in Norwich, Conn., to $73,900 from $144,900. That price cut prompted five offers that the company is now considering, says Linda Davis of Re/Max Realty Group, the listing agent. She says the price cut was unusually steep but adds, "At some point, [banks] just decide to let it go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's encouraging, says Ronald Peltier, chief executive of <span class="companylink">HomeServices of America Inc</span>. in Minneapolis, which owns real-estate brokerages in 19 states. "We do need to flush out the distressed inventory," he says, before the rest of the market can stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One positive trend is affordability. A family earning the national median pretax income of $52,800 a year needs to spend 25% of that income to buy a median-priced home, down from 44% in mid-2006, according to John Burns, a real-estate consultant in Irvine, Calif. For the Los Angeles metro area, that ratio has dropped to 45% from 102%. In Phoenix, it is down to 19% from 46%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the markets Mr. Burns expects to recover earliest are the metro areas of Washington, D.C.; San Antonio; Raleigh, N.C.; Denver; Sacramento; and San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">                    Early Signs Of a Turnaround? 
 
  Some home buyers are bidding against each other on foreclosures: 
 
  -- The action is confined to certain markets, including parts of 
California, Arizona and the Washington, D.C., and Minneapolis-St. Paul metro 
areas. 
 
  -- Many markets, including South Florida and New York City, remain glutted.

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">In Atlanta, Irrational Building Exuberance</span>
</div><div class="author">By Alex Frangos   </div><div>1132 words</div><div>22 April 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATLANTA -- A one-mile stretch of Atlanta's upscale Buckhead neighborhood shows why commercial real estate is emerging as an obstacle to pulling the U.S. economy out of recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate developers in Buckhead are building four speculative office buildings at the same time with virtually no leasing activity. The 35 recent condominium projects will help give Atlanta a 40-year supply at the current sales pace. A $600 million outdoor shopping mall under way has suspended construction to save money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glut threatens to worsen the clobbering that many U.S. banks already are getting from nonperforming loans made to owners and developers of office buildings, shopping centers, condos and other commercial real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., first-quarter results announced Monday included a surge in the percentage of commercial real-estate loans that are nonperforming to 7.5% of the Charlotte, N.C., bank's total portfolio of such loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Buckhead, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> financed two of the four speculative office buildings just steps away from each other, despite little evidence there was demand for more than one of them. It also provided a loan for the Streets of Buckhead luxury retail development, now struggling as some retail tenants flee and go bankrupt. There already are two other luxury malls there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve's most recent "beige book" survey of regional economic conditions, released last week, found that commercial real-estate conditions "continued to deteriorate over the past six weeks." Demand for space fell, the supply of sublease space rose and property values moved lower as reality "set in," the survey found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlanta projects reflect the sort of exuberant reasoning that developers and their bankers used in justifying real-estate investments now facing declines in value. Atlanta also shows how the broader economic downturn and financing drought are hammering commercial real estate. Last month, a downtown office building bought at the top of the market was forced into a foreclosure proceeding. An auction is set for May 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slump in the commercial real-estate sector could be a drag on the economic recovery. While some of the Atlanta projects already are defaulting on loans, others won't start running into financial problems for months or years, with a crescendo of loan maturities starting in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About $248 billion in commercial real-estate debt comes due this year, according to Foresight Analytics LLC. In 2010 and 2011, a total of $566 billion matures. While most other cities haven't seen as much speculative office development as Buckhead, many are suffering from an oversupply of new condos and retail space. Other places are hurting as surplus office space is dumped by companies and from declining values of properties purchased when times were good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is about as bad as it's been in modern times, and we haven't even seen most of the commercial damage yet," said Tom Bell, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Cousins Properties Inc</span>., the Atlanta developer of one of the four towers. "It's going to be a rocky road for a while." He, like his three competitors, is bullish about his own project over the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cousins led Buckhead's most recent development boom. Taking advantage of a sewage project that made development possible, the company built a glass pinstriped tower called Terminus 100. It filled quickly with financial-services firms and other tenants after opening in 2007. "It riveted the development community," said Ken Ashley, an office-leasing broker with Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The math was compelling. Office buildings were selling for $400 a square foot, while you could build one for $300 a square foot, according to Kris Miller, president of Ackerman &amp; Co., an Atlanta real-estate firm. Fill a 500,000-square-foot building with tenants and then flip it to the next guy with various fees added, and you could make about a $45 million profit, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first building to follow Terminus 100 was a project by Regent Properties called the Sovereign. It opened in mid-2008 and has managed to lease three-quarters of its space. After the Regent building came Terminus 200, Cousins's encore to its successful first tower, built next-door. It broke ground in early 2007. Mr. Bell, of Cousins, figured the other companies planning towers would fall away when they saw his bulldozers preparing the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the others didn't stop. Mr. Bell describes stages of bewilderment as the other three projects moved forward so quickly. The Buckhead market on average absorbs 300,000 square feet a year, said Lanie Rea, a research manager at brokers <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. That is less than the size of each tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer Properties, of New York, started the second tower of the bunch, just up the road. <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. is an equity partner, and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> provided the $116 million construction loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third building led by a consortium of developers including Pope &amp; Land Enterprises and <span class="companylink">Duke Realty Corp</span>., broke ground in mid-2007. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> again provided the financing: $108 million for the office portion of the mixed-use project, which also includes condominiums. A spokeswoman for the developers said there has been a "tremendous amount of activity" among prospective tenants at the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian insurer <span class="companylink">Manulife Financial Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Crescent Resources</span>, a developer owned by <span class="companylink">Duke Energy Corp</span>. and a unit of <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, was last. It launched Phipps Tower in March 2008, days before <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns Cos</span>. collapsed. <span class="companylink">Regions Financial Corp</span>., a Birmingham, Ala., bank, arranged the $95 million construction loan. A Regions spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Bell, at Cousins, was incredulous that Crescent and Manulife went ahead. "I threw up my hands. The world's gone crazy," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Gilliam, Manulife's regional director in Atlanta, said Mr. Bell and the others knew the Phipps site, which some local brokers consider the best located, was ready to go. "I would ask why they would do it. They knew the Phipps site was there all along," said Mr. Gilliam. He said Manulife is pleased to be in the project and intends to stay for the long haul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cousins building is the only one of the four to find a tenant: a 50,000-square-foot lease with Firethorn Holdings LLC, a mobile-banking company. Prospects that the Buckhead buildings will fill quickly are dim. Buckhead relies on financial-services companies as its best tenants. Those jobs are disappearing. What tenants they do attract are likely to poach from existing landlords, hurting the overall market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk about deep discounts. The property downturn has wiped $50 million off the asking price of a single home in what may be the biggest cut ever on a U.S. house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, for a mere $75 million, a buyer can snare the Greenwich, Conn., manor house of the late Leona Helmsley, complete with two pools, more than 13 bedrooms (six for servants) and a walk-in silver closet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original asking price was $125 million, and industry veterans can't remember a bigger dollar discount. Last July, a Russian billionaire paid Donald Trump $95 million for a Palm Beach, Fla., mansion originally listed at $125 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helmsley-estate representatives put the 40-acre property up for sale just over a year ago. Even then it was an aggressive price, local brokers said. In October, the estate slashed the price to $95 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called Dunnellen Hall, the 20,000-square-foot Jacobean-style brick mansion is set on a park-like property in the Greenwich back country with views of the Long Island Sound. Brochure photos show a large marble reflecting pool and fountain in front and a back terrace leading to a rock- and plant-lined koi pond, flower beds, a large rectangular pool, many trees and a vast green lawn. The home has more than seven main bedrooms plus a staff wing with six bedrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Helmsley, one of the most famous names in New York real estate, and her husband, Harry, paid $11 million for the 1918 house in the early 1980s. They later bought more acreage. The ensuing renovation played a role in her undoing. Among the charges leveled at Mrs. Helmsley when she was convicted in 1989 of tax evasion was that she billed her company for millions of dollars in renovation costs. She served time in federal prison and died in 2007 at age 87.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate prices in Greenwich, a hedge-fund capital, soared during the property boom. But sales there began to slow in early 2008 and remain glacial. Brokers say properties that are selling are concentrated at the lower end of the market, while luxury remains very weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a beautiful, beautiful piece of property," says Barbara Wells, of Prudential Connecticut Realty, who has visited the mansion. "But there are very few deals happening; people are just looking and looking."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steep price cuts are rare in ultra-high-end real estate, because most homeowners rich enough to own such a property are rich enough to hang onto it and avoid the embarrassment of what might appear to be a fire sale. When they failed to get the prices they wanted, financier Leonard Ross and the former Saudi Ambassador to the U.S., Prince Bandar bin Sultan, took their mansions (priced at $165 million and $135 million respectively) off the market in the last two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the Helmsley house must be sold per the terms of Mrs. Helmsley's will. Proceeds from the sale will benefit the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, which will receive the bulk of Mrs. Helmsley's fortune. In her will, Mrs. Helmsley famously gave $12 million to her dog, Trouble, and requested that the trust devote itself to dog-related causes. In February, however, a judge ruled the trustees could also donate to other causes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard Rubenstein, the spokesman for Mrs. Helmsley's estate, said the trustees couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home's baronial features include ornate lamp posts along the driveway, travertine marble floors, 15th-century fireplaces, extensive wood paneling, patterned plaster ceilings, two dining rooms, a wine cellar and a 52-by-26-foot indoor pool, according to the listing posted online with Greenwich realtor David Ogilvy &amp; Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grounds also contain an outdoor pool, a pool cabana with a kitchen, a tennis court and two brick cottages.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson  </div><div>3034 words</div><div>17 April 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mall owner <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>. sought bankruptcy protection early Thursday in one of the largest real-estate failures in U.S. history, capping a precarious, months-long effort to juggle the crushing $27 billion debt load it shouldered in past acquisition sprees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-anticipated Chapter 11 filing might wipe out what remains of the Chicago company's stock, but it won't result in mall closures. Many analysts suspect General Growth will survive a lengthy bankruptcy intact, but perhaps smaller after selling properties, without resorting to liquidation. General Growth, which owns and manages more than 200 malls, is the second-largest U.S. mall owner by number of properties behind <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Growth's board opted Wednesday to make the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York after efforts to piece together a plan for an out-of-court restructuring with a growing list of creditors failed to gain traction, according to people familiar with the talks. The filing includes General Growth, its Rouse Co. subsidiary and most of its malls. It doesn't include General Growth's management company or joint-venture holdings. All told, the filing covers roughly $24 billion of debt, these people say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A General Growth spokesman didn't immediately return messages seeking comment. Trading of the company's stock closed Wednesday at $1.05, down 1 cent, in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has declined by more than 97% in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally forcing the bankruptcy filing after months of payment-deadline extensions was General Growth's failure to secure a deal with holders of $2.25 billion of its bonds to abstain from demanding immediate payment while the company tried to restructure its balance sheet outside of bankruptcy. Several holders of past-due bonds notified the company last Monday that they intended to sue for immediate payment. Meanwhile, additional debts came due on an almost weekly basis, making an out-of-court deal more challenging to reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Growth has since November negotiated for with its lenders for reprieves, sometimes ending up at odds with the likes of <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group</span> and occasionally going for weeks at a time with debts that were past due but not called for payment. Nonetheless, the company and its advisers continued to strive for a restructuring outside of bankruptcy in a bid to preserve as much value for shareholders and lenders as possible. In contrast, the bankruptcy process sometimes can result in divestitures or liquidation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bankruptcy will have far-reaching implications for the mall industry, including putting pressure on already declining property values of U.S. malls, and subsequently mall mortgages, if General Growth dumps property to pay creditors. It also could consolidate power in the oligarchic mall industry if major players like <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Westfield Group</span> and <span class="companylink">Taubman Centers Inc</span>. can come up with the capital to pick up choice pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapse points to an underlying concern for the commercial real estate industry, too. Developers and property owners that loaded up on debt during the past real-estate boom now face mountains of that debt coming due. But some of those borrowers, like General Growth, lack the cash or the borrowing capacity to refinance or pay those debts. Many lenders are granting cash-strapped borrowers extensions of their payment deadlines, but that only postpones rather than resolves the issue. This year alone, an estimated $248 billion of commercial mortgages will come due, up from $230 billion in 2008, according to real-estate research company Foresight Analytics LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, commercial-property values have sunk, hampering the ability of owners to refinance or sell their properties. Real estate research company Green Street Advisors predicts a 40% overall decline in U.S. commercial property values in this recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, General Growth's bankruptcy comes with the U.S. retail market under severe duress. Shoppers have cut their spending as they contend with mounting job losses, home foreclosures and depleted retirement savings. Additionally, a 1.1% decline in retail sales in March from the previous month, following recent gains, signaled that consumer spending probably won't bounce back quickly from the depths of the recession. Retailers, in turn, have slashed their expansion plans and closed stores a pace matched only in the recessions of 2001 and the early 1990s. By extension, mall owners have suffered rising vacancy rates and weakening rent growth at their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among real-estate failures, General Growth's bankruptcy has few peers. In 1992, Canadian developer <span class="companylink">Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd</span>., developer of London's Canary Wharf complex, sought bankruptcy protection with $18.6 billion in debt. Last year, investment bank <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>.'s real-estate assets were valued at $43 billion when it filed for bankruptcy protection, but that figure is mostly made up of loans on real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a mall company, the collapse of General Growth – a company founded by brothers Martin and Matthew Bucksbaum with a single shopping center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1954 - likely is the largest ever. "A few years ago, they were one of the few gold-plated mall owners," says Bernie Haddigan, managing director of brokerage Marcus &amp; Millichap Investment Services' retail division. "It is remarkable how a few wrong decisions made at the wrong time can become fatal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more than 200 U.S. malls and $27 billion in debt, General Growth is so large and its lineup of creditors so complex that, ultimately, it could take "a couple of years" to sort everything out in the bankruptcy case, said Heidi Sorvino, who leads the bankruptcy practice of New York law firm Smith, Gambrell &amp; Russell LLP. "You have bank debt, bondholder debt, properties all over the U.S. and many levels of creditors. This is not a simple bankruptcy," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's possible that nothing will be left for shareholders when the bankruptcy concludes. The stock already had declined by more than 97% from its all-time high of $67 in March 2007. What remains of that equity could be wiped out if General Growth's $27 billion debt load eclipses the aggregate value the company could reap in an outright liquidation -- a scenario in which debt holders would claim all the proceeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some say that, even if General Growth's equity value slightly exceeds its debt, that surplus will be gobbled up by the many fees and costs of the bankruptcy process. Others are betting that shareholders will salvage something if creditors are willing to forego a fire sale and allow a lengthy and orderly process to restructure General Growth's debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activist investor Bill Ackman's <span class="companylink">Pershing Square Capital Management</span> in recent months bought 7.5% of General Growth's stock on the cheap and put another 18% under swap contracts in a gamble that the stock will emerge from a bankruptcy unscathed. "I think a judge looking at the situation will conclude that a simple extension of [payment deadlines] will solve their issues," Mr. Ackman said in a March 16 interview. "I don't think they'll need to dilute shareholders" through issuing new stock to replace debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ackman's Pershing Square has agreed to provide General Growth $375 million in financing during its bankruptcy, including $225 million to pay a past-due, bridge loan arranged late last year by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. Listed among General Growth's largest creditors in its filing are German bank <span class="companylink">Eurohypo AG</span> with a $2.6 billion claim, trustees representing billions of dollars of corporate bonds and several retailers owed small trade debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many analysts suspect that, rather than liquidating, General Growth will restructure in bankruptcy court and emerge as a smaller company after shedding several malls to satisfy creditors. If not, a fire-sale liquidation of General Growth's malls would flood the already weak market for mall sales and hammer the value of those and other malls. "Just the sheer size of the thing and the capital-market climate right now make it impractical to liquidate," says Mike Magerman, senior vice president of credit-rating firm Realpoint LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selling any malls in this recession will be challenging, given that capital is scarce for would-be buyers. Last year, only eight regional malls traded hands in the largest 76 U.S. markets, down from 19 in 2007, according to real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. In that span, U.S. mall values declined by roughly 30%, according to Green Street Advisors Inc. A liquidation of General Growth malls would deepen that decline, perhaps pushing the value of other malls below that of the debt they carry, which would make it tougher to sell or refinance those malls until their values recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If even 10% of those 200 [General Growth] malls are sold, it will represent a deluge of regional malls on the market," says Victor Calanog, Reis' director of research. "Any increase in supply without a pickup in demand will depress prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are less pessimistic. William Taubman, chief operating officer of luxury mall owner <span class="companylink">Taubman Centers Inc</span>., foresees the bankruptcy resulting in only a few General Growth malls trading hands. "I think there are plenty of financial players who are interested in buying well located, well-leased, high-quality property at decent pricing," he said. "It will take time, but I think this will resolve itself in a smoother manner than most would think."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some complications will prove to be unavoidable, though. Several of General Growth's malls likely can't be sold because they're "under water," meaning their value has declined below what is owed on their mortgages. If so, lenders who provided those mortgages can ask the bankruptcy judge for permission to foreclose on the properties. However, they'll first have to convince the judge that those malls aren't critical to General Growth's restructuring or liquidation plan. Green Street Advisors estimates that roughly 60 of General Growth's malls – mostly those of average or below-average quality – are now valued at less than their mortgage amounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other mall owners are acutely aware of the damage that a General Growth liquidation could do to the value of their own malls and to lenders' willingness to lend to the industry. Thus, many prefer that General Growth survive as a standalone company. "I believe that the most value will be preserved for all parties by a negotiated solution that keeps the company intact," said Edward Glickman, president and chief operating officer of <span class="companylink">Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust</span>, which owns 38 malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some, however, anticipate fortifying their dominance of the mall industry as General Growth crumbles, even if the collapse roils the industry for a while. That's the case for David Simon, chairman and chief executive of Simon, the largest U.S. mall owner by number of properties and one often mentioned as a potential acquirer of various General Growth malls. "The reason is very simple: You're the strong and you get stronger, and the No. 2 competitor, no matter what happens, is weakened for years to come," Mr. Simon said at an investment conference in March. "We should benefit from that in the long run. In that I feel confident."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing General Growth's bankruptcy doesn't signal is a widespread closure of the company's malls. The company's downfall didn't result from store closures and curtailed shopping. To wit, General Growth's malls, widely considered to be of above-average quality, posted a healthy occupancy of 92.5% in last year's fourth quarter, though the cash flow they generate was sapped by the recession's toll on retailers and shoppers alike. General Growth's undoing, instead, was its stockpiling of debt and its subsequent struggles to refinance or pay off that debt in this recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, the bankruptcy process doesn't allow retailers to break leases if it is their landlord seeks protection from creditors. "The malls will continue to operate," UBS AG analyst Jeff Spector said. "Tenants are obligated to fulfill lease contracts."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Led by Matthew Bucksbaum and his late brother, Martin, General Growth initially specialized in building malls in secondary and tertiary cities. Humble and hard-working, the Bucksbaums named their company General Growth --rather than using the family name -- so that investors would find it in the stock tables between stalwarts <span class="companylink">General Electric Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">General Motors Corp</span>. General Growth turned aggressive after its 1993 public offering, making several big acquisitions in the following 15 years to become the second-largest U.S. mall owner behind <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>. The company's more than 200 malls are scattered across 44 states and include high-profile venues Water Tower Place in Chicago, Faneuil Hall in Boston and <span class="companylink">Ala Moana</span> Center in Honolulu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With General Growth seeking bankruptcy, the Bucksbaums now are the saga's biggest losers. The family has seen its 25% stake in the company – worth more than $4 billion at its height in 2007 – dwindle to less than $100 million. The family has sold no General Growth stock since the company's second stint as a publicly traded venture started in 1993. "These are basically great, hard-working, ethical people, and this saddens me," said Morris Mark, a New York investment manager and friend of the Bucksbaums who served on General Growth's board from 1992 to 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mall giant's collapse is a rare event for a real estate investment trust, the widely used corporate structure created by tax authorities during the real-estate bust of the early 1990s to allow big real-estate owners to raise much needed capital by selling stock. Most leading U.S. developers adopted the REIT structure, which allows them to pool money from numerous investors for use in buying or developing properties. Most publicly traded REITs are more conservative in their use of debt than are private developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But General Growth took a different tack, loading up on short-term mortgages to finance its acquisition sprees and counting on the deep lending markets of the real-estate boom for continuous refinancing. Ultimately, that heavy reliance on debt, coupled with the credit market's unraveling in the past year, led to the mall giant's downfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a black eye for the mall [property] sector," Green Street analyst Jim Sullivan said. "But General Growth's problems were clearly self-inflicted."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Growth's mountain of debt grew primarily because the company's executives, namely former Chief Financial Officer Bernie Freibaum, favored mortgages as a primary financing tool. A mortgage, which is tied to a specific property, doesn't place restrictions on how much debt a borrower can put on its other properties. In contrast, corporate bonds and bank loans – used more widely by other mall owners - restrict a borrower's overall indebtedness through debt covenants and credit ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we wanted to use bonds, we would have to keep a significant amount of our malls [debt-free]. Otherwise, you don't get an investment-grade rating from the [credit-rating] agencies," Mr. Freibaum said in a March 2008 interview. General Growth considered mortgages "a lot more available" and more flexible than were bonds and bank lines, he said. He hasn't returned messages seeking comment in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Freibaum answered to John Bucksbaum, the founding-family scion who ascended through General Growth's ranks to become CEO in 1999. An avid skier and cyclist, Mr. Bucksbaum took a behind-the-scenes role overseeing leasing, development and other duties while Mr. Freibaum handled lenders and investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Messrs. Freibaum and Bucksbaum at the helm, General Growth's debt swelled to $27 billion by 2007, amounting to one of the highest debt-to-asset ratios among publicly traded mall REITs. But as the capital markets dried up in 2008, General Growth found it couldn't refinance on affordable terms its many debts coming due. The company turned to selling equity, raising $822 million in March 2008. It also examined selling stakes in its malls, but it didn't complete such a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 3, the board dismissed Mr. Freibaum, reasoning that he no longer could handle delicate negotiations with lenders and that he was at odds with the company's main advisor, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group</span>, these people say. Roughly three weeks later, the board requested the resignation of Mr. Bucksbaum as CEO after discovering that his family trust had, without seeking the board's approval, loaned Mr. Freibaum $90 million and President and Chief Operating Officer Bob Michaels $10 million to help them pay margin loans on their General Growth stock holdings. Mr. Bucksbaum remains as chairman and Mr. Michaels as a senior executive. Lead director Adam Metz stepped in as CEO and fellow director Thomas Nolan as president and, eventually, chief operating officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With General Growth now in bankruptcy court, a wide array of creditors will jostle to recoup as much as possible from the company. Roughly $18.3 billion of General Growth's debt is secured, meaning those investors have direct claim to one or more of General Growth's properties. Another $6.6 billion is unsecured in the form of bonds, convertible debt and a credit facility. The unsecured creditors can recoup their outlays only after the secured creditors have been made whole. Much of the rest of the debt is held by joint ventures in which General Growth teamed with partners to buy various malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key battle in bankruptcy court will involve $3.1 billion in bonds that General Growth inherited from takeover target Rouse. General Growth operated Rouse as a separate subsidiary, meaning those bondholders can argue that they should have exclusive claim to Rouse malls, which are of higher quality than the rest of General Growth's portfolio. If a bankruptcy judge opts to consolidate those bonds with the rest of General Growth's unsecured debt, the fatter proceeds gained from selling the Rouse malls will be spread among all unsecured creditors rather than being set aside solely for Rouse bondholders.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-building sector showed tentative signs of bottoming out in March, the latest indication that a key sector of the economy may be stabilizing after years of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing starts last month tumbled 10.8% to an annual rate of 510,000 units, the decline was centered on the volatile multifamily category -- including apartment construction -- that surged the prior month. Starts of single-family homes remained flat from February at 358,000, the Commerce Department said, marking the third-straight month around that low level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate government report, initial jobless claims tumbled 53,000 to 610,000 in the week ending April 11, the Labor Department said. The decline brought the four-week average for claims -- used to smooth out volatility -- down 8,500 to 651,000, the first decline since the beginning of this year. But analysts warned that the improvement could be a statistical fluke due to the Good Friday holiday, when many government unemployment offices were closed. Continuing claims for unemployment benefits jumped 172,000 to 6.02 million in the week ended April 4, underscoring the difficulty in finding new work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data backed the view -- shared by private analysts and Federal Reserve policy makers -- that some sectors of the economy are halting their free fall and nearing bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economy is still very weak, but there are some encouraging signs that support cautious optimism," Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in a speech Thursday. Mr. Lockhart, who expects the economy to start its turnaround with "slow and tentative growth as early as the third quarter," said he is still concerned about job losses and falling house prices, along with the state of the commercial real-estate sector and its effect on the banking system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction is expected to remain under intense pressure for an extended period due to the glut of housing inventory on the market. The large supply of unsold new homes -- a year's worth at the end of February -- is pushing prices down and offering builders less incentive to start construction. Some economists said the oversupply would leave housing starts depressed, or even spur further declines, in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With sales very weak, the credit market still dislocated and lending standards staying very tight, single-family housing starts are likely to remain low for an extended time despite record low mortgage rates," said Steven Wood of Insight Economics.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturing activity is expected to keep contracting for at least another three to six months and most manufacturers say federal stimulus spending will be only "slightly" effective in boosting the economy, according to a survey of major producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the home-building sector showed tentative signs of bottoming out in March, the latest indication that a key sector of the economy may be stabilizing after years of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing starts last month tumbled 10.8% to an annual rate of 510,000 units, the decline was centered on the volatile multifamily category -- including apartment construction -- that surged the prior month. Starts of single-family homes remained flat from February at 358,000, the Commerce Department said, marking the third-straight month around that low level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing survey, conducted quarterly by the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a public-policy group based in Arlington, Va., also found that most expect that a recovery, when it does come, will be "gradual and weak."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've never seen anything like this," said Don Norman, the economist who conducted the survey, in terms of the consistently gloomy responses from manufacturers on everything from their exports to how much they plan to invest abroad or at home this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey, based on responses from financial executives at a cross section of 63 large manufacturers, found overall manufacturing activity last month hit its lowest level since the survey began in March, 1972, dropping from 28% in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 21% for the latest quarter. Any reading under 50% indicates contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate government report, initial jobless claims tumbled 53,000 to 610,000 in the week ending April 11, the Labor Department said. The decline brought the four-week average for claims -- used to smooth out volatility -- down 8,500 to 651,000, the first decline since the beginning of this year.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do not expect a strong recovery, but I do expect the economic contraction we're now experiencing to give way to slow and tentative growth as early as the third quarter," Mr. Lockhart said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The signs of stabilization in housing starts followed a report this week that showed sentiment among home builders improving from rock-bottom levels. An index by the National Association of Home Builders tracking builders' perceptions about the housing market rose to 14 in April from 9 in March. Part of the increase was due to an improved outlook for sales in the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction is expected to remain under intense pressure for an extended period due to the glut of housing inventory on the market. The large supply of unsold new homes -- a year's worth at the end of February -- is pushing prices down and offering builders less incentive to start construction.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts have declined 80% from the 2006 peak, and last month were just half of their March 2008 pace. The decline in home construction is a key step to giving the housing sector room to recover. Foreclosures on existing homes are already adding to the glut of homes on the market. That is depressing home prices, knocking down the value of mortgage securities and weighing on the nation's banking sector and overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if housing starts stabilize, the overall housing sector is expected to remain under pressure for years. Home prices in major metro areas declined 29.1% through January from their 2006 peak, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index. Most economists expect them to continue declining through most of 2009 -- if not longer -- as high foreclosures and inventories weigh on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As we move into the crucial spring selling season," <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economists said, "the outlook for the housing market for now remains bleak."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. home-building sector showed more signs of bottoming out in March. While overall housing starts fell 11%, starts on new single-family homes held near the same level for the third straight month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, starts fell to a seasonally adjusted 510,000 annual rate, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The bigger-than-expected drop came a day after a measure of home-builder sentiment rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders/<span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Housing Market Index, which is based on a survey of home builders' perceptions about the housing market, rose to 14 in April from 9 in March following months of dismal readings. Partly driving the unexpectedly large rise this month was the builders' brightening outlook for sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders said sales have been improving in recent weeks due to low mortgage rates and U.S. government efforts to spur purchases by first-time buyers, such as an $8,000 tax credit. However, an indicator of future building resumed falling, according to Thursday's report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many analysts warned that any optimism may prove short-lived if banks dump additional foreclosed houses on the market at steep discounts and unemployment worsens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. jobless claims last week plunged 53,000 to 610,000 -- another positive sign -- though the holiday may have skewed the figures. Continuing claims for unemployment benefits jumped 172,000 to 6.022 million in the week ended April 4, underscoring the difficulty in finding new work.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of home-builder sentiment rose this month, offering another possible sign that the housing market is beginning to stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders/<span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Housing Market Index, which is based on a survey of home builders' perceptions about the housing market, rose to 14 in April from 9 in March following months of dismal readings. Partly driving the unexpectedly large rise this month was the builders' brightening outlook for sales over the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders said in recent weeks that sales have been improving because of low mortgage rates and government efforts to spur purchases by first-time buyers, such as an $8,000 tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in the NAHB index, which is seasonally adjusted to account for the typical uptick in spring sales, follows other signs that the market is nearing a bottom, including a rise in existing and new home sales and single family housing permits in February. Some analysts said Pulte Home Inc.'s recent acquisition of Centex Corp., to form the nation's largest home-building company, may have been partly driven by a belief that the market was bottoming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have a lot of little signals here and there that there has been a bottoming in sales," says David Crowe, the NAHB's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shares of some battered home builders rose as much as 20% on Wednesday, but many analysts warned that the optimism may prove short-lived if banks dump additional foreclosed houses on the market at steep discounts and unemployment worsens.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic crisis has created a survival-of-the-fittest environment for U.S. real-estate investment trusts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With many REITs trading at distressed levels amid a continuing credit crunch, experts say the stage is being set for merger-and-acquisition plays, with stronger companies taking over weaker rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do think that M&amp;A activity will begin to accelerate this year," particularly if interest rates stay low, said Jay Leupp, a portfolio manager for Grubb &amp; Ellis AGA Realty Income Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign that a cycle of consolidation may be afoot, shopping center REIT <span class="companylink">Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust</span> announced late last month that it "received indications of interest" from third parties, including <span class="companylink">Equity One Inc</span>. The companies are trading around $9 and $14 a share, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most experts say the companies most ripe for acquisition are trading below $5 a share, including debt-laden <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>. Flirting with bankruptcy, the mall operator has long been mentioned as an acquisition target of rivals <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>., the largest U.S. REIT, and <span class="companylink">Westfield Group</span>, based in Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leupp noted that over 30% of REITs are trading below $5. "That's the most ever," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those distressed share prices run across all sectors. For instance, shopping-center REIT Developers Diversified Realty Corp. is trading around $3 a share, while highly levered office property developer <span class="companylink">Maguire Properties Inc</span>. is at roughly $1.40, as is lodging REIT FelCor Lodging Trust Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are more than 130 public REITs, which saw a boom during the 1990s as investors thirsted for yield, but the relatively large number has some experts thinking the market is oversaturated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are way too many REITs. We don't need all of the REITs that we have," said Rich Moore, an analyst at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs, which own about $600 billion of commercial real-estate assets, were established in the 1960s to give individuals an easy way to invest in income-producing real estate. Such companies typically focus on distinct areas of property, such as offices, retail or apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If credit markets don't thaw soon with the help of federal aid initiatives, some companies will be hard-pressed to survive if they can't refinance their debt. The outlook gets more dire in 2011 when $500 billion of commercial real-estate maturities come due, according to a report from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, citing data from <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. and Securities and Exchange Commission filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As credit remains tight, the market has been heartened by the ability of some REITs to successfully sell equity, including <span class="companylink">Simon Property</span>, <span class="companylink">Kimco Realty Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families that include children from previous marriages often come with all sorts of complications. Who goes where for the holidays, for instance. Or what roles do step-parents play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there's estate planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When spouses in blended families sit down to decide who will inherit what, every decision is complicated by the often-difficult and complex emotional bonds among parents, step-parents, half-siblings and other family members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The hardest question is what's yours, what's mine and what's ours," says Jerry Chasen, an estate-planning attorney in Miami. Heads of blended families frequently find it more difficult to decide how to distribute their estate, Mr. Chasen says. "The answers have to be explored carefully -- and each partner has to be honest about his or her intentions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lack of frankness can have dire consequences -- ranging from the litigious (children from a first marriage sue for a portion of the estate) to the emotional (the estate sows division among family members) to the practical (the estate doesn't provide for a partner or child as intended). Estate planners say it's essential for heads of blended families to communicate openly and honestly about each spouse's priorities. A trusted financial adviser or other counselor may help facilitate those conversations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After heads of blended families decide what they want, they can draw on an array of tools to ensure that their assets are distributed in accordance with their wishes. What follows is a look at some of those tools, and other steps that spouses can take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pre- and Postnuptial Agreements</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prenuptial agreements often are criticized for fostering mistrust and paranoia between couples. But for parents entering a second or third marriage, a prenup can be an efficient way to specify which assets are considered marital property and which are not -- thus offering a way to protect the rights of each spouse's existing children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a prenuptial agreement, one partner can waive rights to property, such as a vacation home or family business, that the other partner would like to save for his or her children. Likewise, a couple may use a prenup to divvy the college savings they've designated for the children they have separately, and to set money aside for children they may have together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prenuptial agreements also can specify ownership of future assets, such as inheritances and gifts the couple receives. Say a husband stands to inherit a piece of art from his parents, and would like to pass the painting on to his son from his first marriage. A prenuptial agreement written before his second marriage can designate the painting as individual property, and the husband's will can specifically direct it to the son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Couples who already have blended their families might consider establishing a postnuptial agreement, which can cover much of the same ground. "Some retirement plans require a spouse's consent in order to give the plan's assets to anyone but that spouse," adds Mr. Chasen. "A postnuptial agreement is a great place to provide that consent in a manner that is legally enforceable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In either situation, each party should hire an attorney to represent his or her interests, and to ensure that the agreement will be enforceable in the case of divorce or death. "All a pre- or postnuptial agreement means in this situation is that you want to make sure your children from a prior marriage are protected," says Mr. Chasen. "It absolutely does not mean you distrust your spouse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QTIPs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A qualified terminable interest property trust, or QTIP, provides a way for many blended families to meet dual goals: providing income for a surviving partner while preserving assets for children conceived with a previous partner. Income from the trust must be distributed to the surviving partner at least annually. He or she also may receive additional distributions, depending on how the trust is drafted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The QTIP also can be beneficial for estate-tax planning purposes. (In 2009, the portion of an estate that exceeds $3.5 million is subject to estate tax.) Assets in a QTIP are included in the grantor's estate, but are eligible for a full marital deduction so no tax will be due on them at the grantor's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the trust's assets will also be considered part of the surviving spouse's estate. If the QTIP increases the surviving spouse's estate-tax liability, assets in the trust generally are used to pay those taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life Insurance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standard life-insurance policies can be particularly useful for married couples in which one spouse is considerably older than the other. For example, the older spouse might name his or her children from a previous marriage as the beneficiaries of a policy, and leave other assets to his or her current spouse and any children they might have together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An older spouse who has considerable assets may wish to use an irrevocable life-insurance trust. The trust -- not the individual -- owns the life-insurance policy. As a result, the policy's proceeds are excluded from the individual's taxable estate, as long as the policy is placed in trust three or more years before the death of the grantor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beneficiary Information and Wills</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeping beneficiary information up to date is crucial, and involves more than just wills. A January U.S. Supreme Court decision shows how a beneficiary designated years earlier can come back to haunt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, say Anna and Bill divorce. Bill waives any claim on Anna's retirement-plan assets, but Anna neglects to change the beneficiary from Bill to her new spouse. The Supreme Court has decided that if the oversight is not corrected, Bill will receive the assets upon Anna's death -- contrary to her wishes and even to the terms of Anna and Bill's divorce agreement. In Kennedy v. Plan Administrator for DuPont Savings and Investment Plan, the court unanimously ruled that the plan administrator must follow the instructions laid out in its own documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The person on the beneficiary form gets the money," says Dawn Brown, a certified financial planner with L.J. Altfest &amp; Co. in New York. "This decision illustrates how important it is to keep beneficiary designations up to date."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming both partners want to disinherit their former spouses, they should remove them as beneficiaries on life-insurance policies and retirement accounts, as well as from documents establishing ownership of real estate, vehicles and bank accounts. In addition, families should review their will and other estate plans at least every five years, or whenever they experience a significant change such as a birth, death or divorce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's important that people remember to update beneficiary and estate-plan information following any major change in life circumstances," says Ms. Brown. "Otherwise, they risk leaving beloved family members out of their estate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Family Communication</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estate planners emphasize that the most important element of building and maintaining any estate plan is communication with family members. This step is particularly important -- and can be particularly challenging -- in blended families, where children may be extremely sensitive to what they perceive as inequity in the distribution of assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For this reason, Mr. Chasen, the attorney, recommends that blended families speak frankly with their financial advisers about the rationale behind their decisions. "That way, if survivors don't fare as well in the plan as they might like, your adviser can explain why it's structured the way it is, and what your best intentions were," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Couples also should discuss their decisions with their children and step-children. Difficult as the conversation may be, it can prevent serious disagreements in years to come. "People don't want to talk about their estate plans because it means accepting the fact that they're going to die someday," says Ms. Brown. "But it's crucial to communicate goals and intentions related to estate planning very clearly in order to avoid ill will among the survivors."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery   </div><div>860 words</div><div>9 April 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Pulte Homes Inc</span>. said it plans to acquire Centex Corp. for $1.3 billion in stock in a deal that would create the nation's largest home builder and amount to a big bet that the housing market is nearing bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surprise deal is the largest merger in the home-building industry since the housing downturn began about three years ago and comes amid mixed signals about whether the worst is over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The merged company would control nearly 190,000 housing lots in 29 states, one of the largest land supplies in the industry and be a major builder of homes for first-time home buyers and retirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the transaction, which must be approved by shareholders of both companies, Pulte would be able to tap Centex's $1.7 billion in cash. That would give the combined company $3.4 billion in cash, the most in the industry and a critical factor in paying down debt and maintaining operations while home sales are slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The merger also would give Pulte access to Centex's extensive property holdings and a brand geared toward first-time home buyers, a segment that is likely to remain one of the industry's strongest over the next few years as the government seeks to boost demand through low mortgage rates, tax credits and other subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal follows recent signs that the housing market is starting to stabilize, with both new- and existing-home sales having risen in February. But many on Wall Street haven't made much out of those numbers because about half of the sales currently are by lenders on foreclosures and other distressed homes, and values are continuing to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts said Pulte's bid for Centex is a sign that one of the nation's largest home builders believes conditions are nearing a bottom. They said Pulte wouldn't be buying Centex -- adding its roughly 68,000 controlled lots to Pulte's supply of about 120,800 -- unless it believed that sales were stabilizing. Typically, many builders have acquired rivals when they have needed to replenish their land supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal "signals to me that Pulte management believes the market is not going to get worse from here," said Paul Puryear, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Raymond James &amp; Associates</span>. "But I don't think the rest of the industry shares that view."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulte Chief Executive Richard Dugas, in a conference call with investors, said there are positive signs in the market. He said first-quarter orders appear better than in the fourth quarter, although that is typically the case because of seasonality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Dugas said the signs of improvement in the housing market were not the "primary driver" of the merger. Rather, he said cost savings and other benefits were the main reasons for the deal. The combined company expects to save $350 million annually, partly by reducing overlapping overhead. "We believe the combined companies will allow us to get to profitability quicker," Mr. Dugas said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors were wary. In 4 p.m. composite trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Pulte shares were down $1.13, or 11%, to $9.64.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of most other home builders rose, possibly signaling that some investors believe other mergers are likely. But many observers think this deal is unique. Dallas-based Centex is one of the few builders that has been trading at less than book value but has a relatively healthy balance sheet. Other heavily discounted builders, like <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises</span>, have debt levels that could worry potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new company could also be taking on more risk. Moody's Investors Service placed the companies' combined debt ratings under review for possible downgrade. Specifically, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> said it was examining whether the new company's larger land portfolio would increase risks to debt holders. It is possible that Pulte will have to write down Centex's landholdings as home prices keep sliding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, Centex has large landholdings in Texas and the Carolinas, where home sales have held up relatively well. Pulte, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., would be gaining an important foothold in these markets through the merger. The deal would also allow Pulte to reduce its exposure to the active-adult retirement market, where much of its sales has been concentrated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the terms of the proposed deal when announced, Centex shareholders would receive 0.975 share of Pulte common stock for each share of Centex they own. Based on the $10.77 closing price of Pulte stock on Tuesday, the transaction values Centex at $10.50 a share, a 38% premium over Centex's Tuesday close of $7.62. Centex shares on Wednesday rose $1.44, or 19%, to 9.06.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dugas will be the president and CEO of the newly combined company. Centex CEO Timothy Eller will join Pulte's board as vice chairman and will serve as a consultant to the company for two years after the deal closes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk about capitulation! Judging from my mailbag following last week's coverage of the Case-Shiller housing numbers[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123853857749575441.html], almost nobody has a good word to say about the real estate market any more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm an instinctive contrarian. So I hope readers don't take it the wrong way when I say that when so many of you agree with me, I start to get nervous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And where is my hate mail? The brokers must be totally whipped. Even a year ago anyone questioning housing prices could reliably expect a torrent of furious replies from those in the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today? Almost nothing. And the few left are mostly of the "U r an idiot (Sent from my iPhone)" variety. Pitiful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe the moment of maximum pessimism is at hand after all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let me play devil's advocate and consider the positive case for buying a home right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key factor: Interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you can borrow at 4.5% or 5% over 30 years, many purchases start to look appealing. Especially if we get a hefty dose of inflation down the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that happens, your monthly payments will be low and you'd get to repay the principal over time with devalued dollars. That's a double win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation isn't guaranteed: The bond markets are only predicting about 1.4% inflation over the next 10 years, and BCA Research recently reminded clients that deflation, or falling prices, remains a danger. Unemployment is still rising and recent wages actually fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet if you had to bet from here, you'd bet on inflation in due course. The government is running massive deficits and has the printing presses at full throttle. That's the classic recipe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And inflation is the debtors' friend -- which is why it is surely going to prove the politically expedient way out of this mess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone purchasing hard assets like real estate, with a 5% fixed rate loan, ought to make good money if that happens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to the house prices, it's true they may not have fallen as far as you might expect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent analysis in the Financial Analysts Journal ("When Will Housing Recover?") suggested prices nationwide still weren't cheap by historical standards in relation to household incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes were much cheaper, say, as recently as the 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore: the bigger the bubble, the bigger the bust. Considering how sharply home prices climbed from 2002 to 2006, one might expect real estate to end up really, really cheap before bottoming out. And you wouldn't expect a quick rebound either. Japan still hasn't recovered from 1989.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you are thinking of buying a home, here's the more positive news: While overall market averages may not be as cheap as you might have expected, you can probably ignore them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are plenty of deals taking place far below the official average levels. The indices are masking a huge disparity in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the National Association of Realtors concedes distressed sales – including foreclosures and short sales – are closing about 20% below "normal" market rates. (Never mind how to define "normal").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aggressive buyers are finding some simply terrific deals. And they're paying with cheap debt, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Default rates are rising. Lots of sellers are forced. A buyer with options holds all the cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once upon a time, the name of the real estate game was "let's make a deal." Today, it's "take it or leave it." If the seller won't take your offer, his neighbor probably will.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">From Bubble to Depression?</span>
</div><div class="author">By Steven Gjerstad  and Vernon L. Smith   </div><div>2455 words</div><div>6 April 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bubbles have been frequent in economic history, and they occur in the laboratories of experimental economics under conditions which -- when first studied in the 1980s -- were considered so transparent that bubbles would not be observed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We economists were wrong: Even when traders in an asset market know the value of the asset, bubbles form dependably. Bubbles can arise when some agents buy not on fundamental value, but on price trend or momentum. If momentum traders have more liquidity, they can sustain a bubble longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what sparks bubbles? Why does one large asset bubble -- like our dot-com bubble -- do no damage to the financial system while another one leads to its collapse? Key characteristics of housing markets -- momentum trading, liquidity, price-tier movements, and high-margin purchases -- combine to provide a fairly complete, simple description of the housing bubble collapse, and how it engulfed the financial system and then the wider economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In just the past 40 years there were two other housing bubbles, with peaks in 1979 and 1989, but the largest one in U.S. history started in 1997, probably sparked by rising household income that began in 1992 combined with the elimination in 1997 of taxes on residential capital gains up to $500,000. Rising values in an asset market draw investor attention; the early stages of the housing bubble had this usual, self-reinforcing feature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2001 recession might have ended the bubble, but the Federal Reserve decided to pursue an unusually expansionary monetary policy in order to counteract the downturn. When the Fed increased liquidity, money naturally flowed to the fastest expanding sector. Both the Clinton and Bush administrations aggressively pursued the goal of expanding homeownership, so credit standards eroded. Lenders and the investment banks that securitized mortgages used rising home prices to justify loans to buyers with limited assets and income. Rating agencies accepted the hypothesis of ever rising home values, gave large portions of each security issue an investment-grade rating, and investors gobbled them up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing expenditures in the U.S. and most of the developed world have historically taken about 30% of household income. If housing prices more than double in a seven-year period without a commensurate increase in income, eventually something has to give. When subprime lending, the interest-only adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), and the negative-equity option ARM were no longer able to sustain the flow of new buyers, the inevitable crash could no longer be delayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price decline started in 2006. Then policies designed to promote the American dream instead produced a nightmare. Trillions of dollars of mortgages, written to buyers with slender equity, started a wave of delinquencies and defaults. Borrowers' losses were limited to their small down payments; hence, the lion's share of the losses was transmitted into the financial system and it collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 1976-79 and 1986-89 housing price bubbles, the effective federal-funds interest rate was rising while housing prices rose: The Federal Reserve, "leaning against the wind," helped mitigate the bubbles. In January 2001, however, after four years with average inflation-adjusted house price increases of 7.2% per year (about 6% above trend for the past 80 years), the Fed started to decrease the fed-funds rate. By December 2001, the rate had been reduced to its lowest level since 1962. In 2002 the average fed-funds rate was lower than in any year since the 1958 recession. In 2003 and 2004 the average fed-funds rates were lower than in any year since 1955 when the rate series began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monetary policy, mortgage finance, relaxed lending standards, and tax-free capital gains provided astonishing economic stimulus: Mortgage loan originations increased an average of 56% per year for three years -- from $1.05 trillion in 2000 to $3.95 trillion in 2003!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time the Federal Reserve began to slowly raise the fed-funds rate in May 2004, the Case-Shiller 20-city composite index had increased 15.4% during the previous 12 months. Yet the housing portion of the CPI for those same 12 months rose only 2.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How could this happen? In 1983, the Bureau of Labor Statistics began to use rental equivalence for homeowner-occupied units instead of direct home-ownership costs. Between 1983 and 1996, the price-to-rental ratio increased from 19.0 to 20.2, so the change had little effect on measured inflation: The CPI underestimated inflation by about 0.1 percentage point per year during this period. Between 1999 and 2006, the price-to-rent ratio shot up from 20.8 to 32.3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With home price increases out of the CPI and the price-to-rent ratio rapidly increasing, an important component of inflation remained outside the index. In 2004 alone, the price-rent ratio increased 12.3%. Inflation for that year was underestimated by 2.9 percentage points (since "owners' equivalent rent" is about 23% of the CPI). If home-ownership costs were included in the CPI, inflation would have been 6.2% instead of 3.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With nominal interest rates around 6% and inflation around 6%, the real interest rate was near zero, so household borrowing took off. As measured by the Case-Shiller 10 city index, the accumulated inflation in home-ownership costs between January 1999 and June 2006 was 151%, but the CPI measured a mere 23% increase. As the Federal Reserve monitored inflation in the early part of this decade, home-price increases were no longer visible in the CPI, so the lax monetary policy continued. Even after the Fed began to slowly raise the fed-funds rate in May 2004, the average rate remained low and the bubble continued to inflate for two more years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unraveling of the bubble is in many ways the most fascinating part of the story, and the most painful reality we are now experiencing. The median price of existing homes had fallen from $230,000 in July to $217,300 in November 2006. By the beginning of 2007, in 17 of the 20 cities in the Case-Shiller index, prices were falling. Serious price declines had not yet begun, but the warning signs were there for alert observers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kate Kelly, writing in this newspaper (Dec. 14, 2007), tells the story of how <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> avoided the fate of many of the other investment banks that packaged mortgages into securities. Goldman loaded up on the Markit ABX index of credit default swaps between early December 2006 and late February 2007, as their price dropped from 97.70 on Dec. 4 to under 64 by Feb. 27. But the market was not yet in free-fall: The insurance on AAA-rated parts of the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) remained inexpensive. By mid-summer 2007, concern spread to the AAA-rated tranches of MBS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of February 2007, the cost of $10 million of insurance on the AAA-rated portion of a mortgage-backed security was still only $68,000 plus a $9,000 annual premium. Housing-market conditions deteriorated further in the first half of 2007. Case-Shiller tiered price sequences in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Miami all show serious declines by the summer of 2007. Prices in the low-price tier in San Francisco were down almost 13% from their peak by July 2007; in San Diego they were off 10% by July 2007. Startling developments began to unfold that month. Between July 9 and Aug. 3, 2007, the cost of insuring AAA MBS tranches went from $50,000 upfront plus a $9,000 annual premium for $10 million of insurance to over $900,000 upfront (plus the annual premium).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the cost of insuring new mortgage-backed securities skyrocketed, mortgage financing from MBS rapidly declined. Subprime originations plummeted from $160 billion in the third quarter of 2006 to $28 billion in the third quarter of 2007. Mortgage-backed security issuance fell comparably, from $483 billion in all of 2006 to only $30.7 billion in the third quarter of 2007. Other measures of new loan originations were falling at the same time. The liquidity that generated the housing market bubble was evaporating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trouble quickly spread from the cost of insuring mortgage-backed securities to problems with credit markets generally, as the spread between short-term U.S. Treasury debt and the LIBOR rate increased to 2.40% from 0.44% between Aug. 8 and Aug. 20, 2007. Since U.S. Treasury debt is generally considered secure, but a bank's loans to another bank carry some risk of default, the spread between these rates serves as an indicator of perceived risk in financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one city after another, prices of homes in the low-price tier appreciated the most and then fell the most; prices in the high-priced tier appreciated least and fell the least. The price index graphs for Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Miami show that in all of these cities, prices in the low-price tier have fallen between 50% and 57%. Moreover, housing prices have continually declined in every market in the Case-Shiller index. According to First American <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, 10.5 million households had negative or near negative equity in December 2008. When housing prices turned down, many borrowers with low income and few assets other than their slender home equity faced foreclosure. The remaining losses had to be absorbed by the financial system. Consequently, the financial system has suffered a blow unlike anything since the Great Depression, and the source is the weak financial position of the people holding declining assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier, during the downturn in the equities market between December 1999 and September 2002, approximately $10 trillion of equity was erased. But a measure of financial system performance, the Keefe, Bruyette, &amp; Woods BKX index of financial firms, fell less than 6% during that period. In the current downturn, the value of residential real estate has fallen by approximately $3 trillion, but the BKX index has now fallen 75% from its peak of January 2007. The financial sector has been devastated in this crisis, whereas it was almost completely unaffected by the downturn in the equities market early in this decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can one crash that wipes out $10 trillion in assets cause no damage to the financial system and another that causes $3 trillion in losses devastate the financial system?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the equities-market downturn early in this decade, declining assets were held by institutional and individual investors that either owned the assets outright, or held only a small fraction on margin, so losses were absorbed by their owners. In the current crisis, declining housing assets were often, in effect, purchased between 90% and 100% on margin. In some of the cities hit hardest, borrowers who purchased in the low-price tier at the peak of the bubble have seen their home value decline 50% or more. Over the past 18 months as housing prices have fallen, millions of homes became worth less than the loans on them, huge losses have been transmitted to lending institutions, investment banks, investors in mortgage-backed securities, sellers of credit default swaps, and the insurer of last resort, the U.S. Treasury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an important paper in 1983, Ben Bernanke argued that during the Depression, severe damage to the financial system impeded its ability to perform its economic role of lending to households for durable goods consumption and to firms for production and trade. We are seeing this process playing out now as loan funds for automobile purchases have withered. Auto sales fell 41% between February 2008 and February 2009. Retail and labor markets too are now part of the collateral damage from the housing debacle. Housing peaked in early 2006. Losses from the mortgage market began to infect the financial system in 2006; asset prices in that sector began to decline at the end of 2006. Meanwhile, equities and the broader economy were performing well, but as the financial sector deteriorated, its problems blindsided the rest of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The events of the past 10 years have an eerie similarity to the period leading up to the Great Depression. Total mortgage debt outstanding increased from $9.35 billion in 1920 to $29.44 billion in 1929. In 1920, residential mortgage debt was 10.2% of household wealth; by 1929, it was 27.2% of household wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Great Depression has been attributed to excessive speculation on Wall Street, especially between the spring of 1927 and the fall of 1929. Had the difficulties of the banking system been caused by losses on brokers' loans for margin purchases in 1929, the results should have been felt in the banks immediately after the stock market crash. But the banking system did not show serious strains until the fall of 1930.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank earnings reached a record $729 million in 1929. Yet bank exposures to real estate were substantial; as the decline in real estate prices accelerated, foreclosures wiped out banks by the thousands. Had the mounting difficulties of the banks and the final collapse of the banking system in the "Bank Holiday" in March 1933 been caused by contraction of the money supply, as Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argued, then the massive injections of liquidity over the past 18 months should have averted the collapse of the financial market during this current crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The causes of the Great Depression need more study, but the claims that losses on stock-market speculation and a monetary contraction caused the decline of the banking system both seem inadequate. It appears that both the Great Depression and the current crisis had their origins in excessive consumer debt -- especially mortgage debt -- that was transmitted into the financial sector during a sharp downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we've offered in our discussion of this crisis is the back story to Mr. Bernanke's analysis of the Depression. Why does one crash cause minimal damage to the financial system, so that the economy can pick itself up quickly, while another crash leaves a devastated financial sector in the wreckage? The hypothesis we propose is that a financial crisis that originates in consumer debt, especially consumer debt concentrated at the low end of the wealth and income distribution, can be transmitted quickly and forcefully into the financial system. It appears that we're witnessing the second great consumer debt crash, the end of a massive consumption binge.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Manhattan's real-estate market has come crashing back to earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of units in newly constructed buildings dropped 67% in the first quarter, and closings slid 52% compared with a year earlier. Inventory climbed 29% to 12,336 listings in March, the highest level in more than eight years, according to a report by real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">The Corcoran Group</span> and PropertyShark.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate site StreetEasy.com says that more than a third of listings shaved prices in the first quarter, with the average cut topping 9%. Halstead Property says that apartments sold during the period stayed on the market 18% longer than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would describe this as a new market -- we essentially hit a reset button. It wasn't like it declined in a slope; it declined in a step," said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Manhattan real-estate consulting and appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because there usually is a multimonth lag between contract and closing, "I think it's safe to say that the bubble had already burst a few months ago," said Sofia Kim, StreetEasy.com's head of research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City had long withstood the prolonged downturn gripping the nation, but that strength crumbled along with <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. in September. The ensuing financial meltdown erased thousands of high-paying jobs and slashed Wall Street bonuses. Those losses, along with tighter lending requirements and a strengthening dollar, have removed a chunk of the world-wide buying pool and halted price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The crisis on Wall Street is certainly showing itself in New York City's real-estate numbers," said Pamela Liebman, Corcoran's chief executive. "The market now is very different."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers and sellers are on opposite sides of a river, and they're yet to find a bridge," Ms. Liebman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few expect the region to experience turmoil similar to Miami or Las Vegas, investor-heavy markets battered by the downturn and bloated foreclosures. While Manhattan did experience a condo boom -- and those values are eroding, causing some signed buyers to try to flee contracts -- that the area is an island means there can only be so much expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, Manhattan prices remain well above the national median price, which was $165,400 in February, according to the National Association of Realtors. According to StreetEasy.com, Manhattan median condo sales fell 4.7% to $895,000 and co-op resales slipped 11.3% to $550,000 in the first quarter from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling prices are good news for potential buyers long priced out of the market. The price tag for an alcove studio on the Upper East Side fell 47.5% to $199,000. A co-op on Park Avenue saw $1.1 million shaved off the price in a single day, Ms. Kim said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P Case-Shiller Index, which tracks home prices in 20 metropolitan areas in the U.S., fell 19% for the three-month period ended in January compared with the year earlier period, which was a record annual rate of decline. An Economy &amp;Politics article Thursday incorrectly said that the index had hit a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJA April 3, 2009)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price declines in many of the largest U.S. cities accelerated in January, according to a closely watched index, offering a grim reminder that the housing market remains in a deep contraction despite recent glimmers of stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P Case Shiller Index, which tracks prices in 20 metropolitan areas, fell 19% for the three-month period ended in January, compared with the year-earlier period. The decline, which follows an 18.5% decline for the three-month period ended in December, sent the index to a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest declines were in cities already hardest hit in the housing bust, including Phoenix, where prices were down 35%, and San Francisco, where prices were off 32%. Nationally, home prices have fallen to levels similar to those of 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price declines, while alarming to home sellers, may explain why the housing market is starting to attract additional buyers. Last week, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes rose an unexpected 5.1% in February from the previous month, providing a ray of hope that sales may be bottoming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly half of those sales were foreclosed houses and other "distressed" properties that were snapped up by buyers looking for bargains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few builders are reporting that sales of new homes are also improving slightly, but only as these companies sharply cut prices to compete with foreclosures. The median sales price for a new home was $200,900 in February, down from $251,000 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While rising sales indicate demand is slowly returning, the bargain hunting is likely to drive prices lower in the next several months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When will home prices stop sliding? "When the share of home sales that are distressed starts to decline is the day that house prices will hit bottom," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That day may not be close at hand. Home lenders, many of which had halted foreclosures temporarily in anticipation of the government's housing plan, appear to be increasing efforts to foreclose. That could produce a new supply of distressed properties. In February, the number of new foreclosure starts rose to 243,000 from 217,000 in January, according to Hope Now, a coalition of mortgage companies, investors and housing counselors, on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of the year, however, Mr. Zandi expects the number of foreclosed houses to decline, as the Obama administration's mortgage-modification plan kicks into gear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot for home buyers is that for the next several months, homes are likely to remain more affordable than they have been in the past several decades, and mortgage rates are near historic lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers are also being helped by an $8,000 federal tax credit, and several states have passed or are considering similar subsidies. California is offering a $10,000 tax credit to buyers of new homes, which is helping goose sales, home builders say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Daigle, 32 years old, a public-relations executive who works in Alexandria, Va., and his wife, who works in the airline industry, are among those first-time buyers lured into the market by lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They weren't alone -- the Daigles were surprised when they got outbid on several bank-owned properties. "Things were starting to get swooped up," Mr. Daigle said. "It was like a switch had been flipped."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Daigles just had their offer of $275,000 accepted on a single-family house in Leesburg, Va., where the market has shown signs of stabilizing amid a relatively good employment outlook in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, however, the employment picture looks pretty grim, which could add to the foreclosure supply as people lose their jobs and default on their mortgages, adding to the pressure on home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the housing market could improve before the job market, said housing economist Thomas Lawler. In the early 1980s, new home sales ticked up before unemployment peaked, Mr. Lawler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If there is a perception on the part of home buyers that the economy might start to rebound in the foreseeable future, then home sales could rebound before the economy does," said Mr. Lawler, who had been a longtime housing bear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I believe there is cause for cautious optimism."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-sector jobs in the U.S. fell a steep 742,000 in March, according to a national employment report published Wednesday by payroll giant <span class="companylink">Automatic Data Processing Inc</span>. and consultancy Macroeconomic Advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, U.S. construction spending fell a fifth month in a row during February, but the drop was much smaller than expected, with surprising resilience in the commercial and public sectors. Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management's March manufacturing index rose a bit to 36.3 compared to 35.8 last month. The result was better than expected, but still indicates contraction in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ADP survey tallies only private-sector jobs while the Bureau of Labor Statistics' nonfarm payroll data, to be released Friday, include government workers. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expect that the BLS will report job losses totaling 673,000 for March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is on top of the 651,000 nonfarm jobs lost in February and the 4.4 million lost since the recession began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite some recent indications that stock prices, consumer spending, and housing activity may be bottoming out, employment, which usually trails overall economic activity, is likely to remain very weak for at least several more months," said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new ADP report showed large businesses with 500 employees or more shed 128,000 jobs and midsize businesses lost 330,000 jobs last month. Small businesses that employ fewer than 50 workers cut 284,000 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Service-sector jobs fell 415,000 in March, while manufacturing employment dropped 206,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total construction spending decreased by 0.9% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $967.52 billion compared to the prior month, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Spending fell 3.5% in January; originally, January spending was seen 3.3% lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street had expected February construction spending would fall by 2%. The last time spending climbed was September; it's down 10% year over year. Recent government data showed the construction industry lost 104,000 jobs in February, with employment dropping by 1.1 million since peaking in January 2007. "Employment fell sharply in both the residential and non-residential components of the industry in February," the Labor Department said in early March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction spending plunged in February, Wednesday's report said, dropping by 4.1% to $282.6 billion. Residential spending decreased 3.5% in January; it was originally seen 2.8% lower for the month. Year over year, residential spending was 29.2% below the February 2008 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data indicated strength in the U.S. housing sector during February, with builders breaking ground at an increased rate and sales of new homes rising for the first time in seven months. Housing starts rose 22.2% and sales of single-family homes climbed by 4.7% in February. But, in a reminder the sector is still in a slump, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price indexes Tuesday showed 14 of 20 major metropolitan areas posted price declines of more than 10% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while housing starts surged in February, groundbreakings were 47.3% below the pace of construction a year earlier, in February 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with weakness in housing is softness in commercial construction. The data Wednesday showed nonresidential construction spending making a surprising climb, up 0.5% in February. Outlays rose for office buildings and hospitals, while falling for roads and water supply facilities. Yet year over year, commercial construction has increased a mere 1.3%. Fewer new homes suggest fewer new neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's Commerce data said construction spending in the private sector during February decreased by 1.6% to $665.9 billion. Spending fell 4.0% in January.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski   </div><div>886 words</div><div>1 April 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The rout in public real-estate stocks continued unabated in the first three months of 2009, as the bottom that some investors thought had appeared at the end of last year turned out to be little more than an illusion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investment trusts staged a big rally at the end of 2008, rising more than 40% in the last six weeks of the year. That partly reversed a 60% plunge and signaled to some optimistic investors that the worst was over for real estate. But in the first quarter, the optimists were crushed by renewed uncertainty about which companies can manage their way through the credit crunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the Dow Jones Equity All REIT Total Return Index, which tracks 113 stocks, posted a negative total return of 32% in the first quarter. That was slightly better than the negative 39% return in the fourth quarter. The index is now down about 68% from its February 2007 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was little difference in performance between real-estate sectors considered the most and least vulnerable to the downturn. REITs that manage hotels and retail space, which tend to get hit the hardest during recessions, were down 38% and 39%, respectively, for the first quarter. Health-care and self-storage REITs, considered more recession-resistant, did only a little better and were down 28% and 32%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Size didn't matter much, either. The shares of <span class="companylink">Public Storage Inc</span>., the largest REIT by market capitalization and an operator of self-storage warehouses, closed at $55.25 on Tuesday afternoon, down 31% for the quarter. <span class="companylink">Simon Properties Group Inc</span>., the largest mall operator, traded at $34.64, down 35%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questions of Survival</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though analysts say companies like Public Storage and Simon, both leaders in their industry, are positioned to weather the recession, the situation is less clear for scores of other REITs. "You're really guessing on who's going to survive and who isn't," said Ed Schwartz of ORG Real Property Consultants. "For some of these REITs, it's like gambling, and we don't suggest our clients gamble."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs are trading at a 5% discount to the value of their underlying assets, assuming those assets have lost about 40% of their value since 2007, according to a research note last month by Green Street Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many institutional investors like pension funds and college endowments have little money left to allocate to REITs, having poured billions into real estate during the boom years. Those that do have cash to invest see appeal in the privately run investment funds already being formed to snap up loans and property on the cheap. In a few years, the thinking goes, real-estate assets may be worth much more than they are now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, real-estate stocks have become a hot vehicle for day traders, feeding tremendous volatility. During the first quarter, REIT stocks experienced four daily swings of 10% or more in their stock price. That was down from fourth quarter of last year when REITs experienced 15 such days. In the first nine months of 2008, there was only one trading day when REIT prices swung more than 10%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has made big real-estate investors wary. Some REITs may look cheap, money manager David Sherman said at a conference last week, but "if they stage a rally of 15% or 20% the way they do in a day these days, to me that cheap disappears."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best-performing large equity REIT during the first quarter was Digital Realty Trust, a San Francisco company that builds and operates computer-data centers for corporate clients. The shares closed up 1% for the quarter on Tuesday, boosted by rising demand for such services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case of <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">ProLogis</span>, the Denver-based warehouse developer burdened by $11 billion of debt, was among the worst performers, tumbling 53%. The company still has top-notch assets and a well-regarded management team. But it is <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span>'s 2010 debt maturities that investors are focusing on, and the company's stock has magnified the market's mood swings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On March 23, as investors celebrated the government's toxic-asset plan and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 7%, <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> stock zoomed up by 28%. This past Monday, when the S&amp;P dropped 3% amid auto-related gloom, <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> fell 12%. The stock followed that with a 24% surge on Tuesday. The wild swings may stem from the perception that the company's viability is riding on when the credit markets open up again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As bad as the first quarter was, some believe that REITs could stage a comeback soon. One believer is Kenneth Rosen, whose Rosen Real Estate Securities LLC manages about $300 million in assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosen argues that the government's new lending programs should rekindle the commercial-property market, and that recent equity raisings by two big REITs, mall owner <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span> and warehouse owner <span class="companylink">AMB Property Corp</span>., signal a bottom. "We've seen the bell ring," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery and Kelly Evans   </div><div>792 words</div><div>1 April 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price declines in many of the largest U.S. cities accelerated in January, according to a closely watched index, offering a grim reminder that the housing market remains in a deep contraction despite recent glimmers of stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P Case Shiller Index, which tracks prices in 20 metropolitan areas, fell 19% for the three-month period ended in January, compared with the year-earlier period. The decline, which follows a 18.5% decline for the three-month period ended in December, was a record annual rate of decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest declines were in cities already hardest hit in the housing bust, including Phoenix, where prices were down 35%, and San Francisco, where prices were off 32%. Nationally, home prices have fallen to levels similar to those of 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price declines, while alarming to home sellers, may explain why the housing market is starting to attract additional buyers. Last week, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes rose an unexpected 5.1% in February from the previous month, providing a ray of hope that sales may be bottoming. Nearly half of those sales were foreclosed houses and other "distressed" properties that were snapped up by buyers looking for bargains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few builders are reporting that sales of new homes are also improving slightly, but only as these companies sharply cut prices to compete with foreclosures. The median sales price for a new home was $200,900 in February, down from $251,000 a year earlier. While rising sales indicate demand is slowly returning, the bargain hunting is likely to drive prices lower in the next several months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When will home prices stop sliding? "When the share of home sales that are distressed starts to decline is the day that house prices will hit bottom," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That day could be a ways off. Home lenders, many of which had halted foreclosures temporarily in anticipation of the government's housing plan, appear to be increasing efforts to foreclose. That could produce a new supply of distressed properties. In February, the number of new foreclosure starts rose to 243,000 from 217,000 in January, according to Hope Now, a coalition of mortgage companies, investors and housing counselors, on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of the year, however, Mr. Zandi expects the number of foreclosed houses to decline, as the Obama administration's mortgage-modification plan kicks into gear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot for home buyers is that for the next several months, homes are likely to remain more affordable than they have been in the past several decades, and mortgage rates are near historic lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers are also being helped by an $8,000 federal tax credit, and several states have passed or are considering similar subsidies. California is offering a $10,000 tax credit to buyers of new homes, which is helping goose sales, home builders say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Daigle, 32 years old, a public-relations executive who works in Alexandria, Va., and his wife, who works in the airline industry, are among those first-time buyers lured into the market by lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They weren't alone -- the Daigles were surprised when they got outbid on several bank-owned properties. "Things were starting to get swooped up," Mr. Daigle said. "It was like a switch had been flipped." The Daigles just had their offer of $275,000 accepted on a single-family house in Leesburg, Va., where the market has shown signs of stabilizing amid a relatively good employment outlook in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, however, the employment picture looks pretty grim, which could add to the foreclosure supply as people lose their jobs and default on their mortgages, adding to the pressure on home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the housing market could improve before the job market, said housing economist Thomas Lawler. In the early 1980s, new home sales ticked up before unemployment peaked, Mr. Lawler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If there is a perception on the part of home buyers that the economy might start to rebound in the foreseeable future, then home sales could rebound before the economy does," said Mr. Lawler, who had been a longtime housing bear. "I believe there is cause for cautious optimism."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the fall of 2007, financial markets were collapsing, and Wall Street firms were losing massive amounts of money, as if they were trying to give back a decade's worth of profits in a few brutal months. An investor named John Paulson somehow was scoring huge profits. His winnings were so enormous they seemed unreal, even cartoonish. His firm, <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>., would make $15 billion in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paulson's personal cut would amount to nearly $4 billion, or more than $10 million a day. That was more than the 2007 earnings of J. K. Rowling, Oprah Winfrey and Tiger Woods put together. At one point in late 2007, a broker called to remind Mr. Paulson of a personal account worth $5 million, an account now so insignificant it had slipped his mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paulson, known as J.P., bet that the housing market would collapse and risky mortgages would tumble in value. The moves put the fund manager from Queens, N.Y., alongside Warren Buffett, George Soros, and Bernard Baruch in Wall Street's pantheon of traders. And as one rival fund manager later would say, with equal parts envy and respect, "Paulson's not even a housing or mortgage guy.... Until this trade, he was run-of-the-mill, nothing special."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Paulson launched his hedge fund in 1994. His forte was investing in corporate mergers that he viewed as the most likely to be completed, among the safest forms of investing. When he met with clients, they sometimes were surprised by his limp handshake and restrained manner, both unusual in an industry full of bluster. Younger hedge-fund traders went tieless and dressed casually, feeling confident in their abilities thanks to their soaring profits and growing stature. Mr. Paulson stuck with dark suits and muted ties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By early 2006 the 49-year-old Mr. Paulson had reached his twilight years in accelerated Wall Street-career time. He had been eclipsed by a group of investors who had amassed huge fortunes in a few years. It was the fourth year of a spectacular surge in housing prices, the likes of which the nation never had seen. Everyone seemed to be making money hand over fist. Everyone but John Paulson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is crazy," Mr. Paulson said to Paolo Pellegrini, one of his analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pellegrini felt his own pressures. A year earlier, the stylish native of Italy had called Mr. Paulson looking for a job after a career of disappointments. <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>. likely was his last stop on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pellegrini spent hours in Mr. Paulson's office, debating how to deduce a turn in the housing market. Mr. Paulson charged Mr. Pellegrini with figuring out whether homes were, in fact, overpriced. Late at night, in his cubicle, Mr. Pellegrini tracked home prices across the country since 1975. Interest rates seemed to have no bearing on real estate. Grasping for new ideas, Mr. Pellegrini added a "trend line" that clearly illustrated how much prices had surged lately. He then performed a "regression analysis" to smooth the ups and downs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer was in front of him: Housing prices had climbed a puny 1.4% annually between 1975 and 2000, after inflation. But they had soared over 7% in the following five years, until 2005. The upshot: U.S. home prices would have to drop by almost 40% to return to their historic trend line. Not only had prices climbed like never before, but Mr. Pellegrini's figures showed that each time housing had dropped in the past, it fell through the trend line, suggesting that an eventual drop likely would be brutal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is unbelievable!" Mr. Paulson said the next morning. The chart was Mr. Paulson's Rosetta Stone enabling him to make sense of the housing market. They had to figure out how to profit from it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the spring, Mr. Paulson was convinced he had discovered the perfect trade. Insurance on risky home mortgages was trading at dirt-cheap prices. He would buy boatloads of credit-default swaps—or investments that served as insurance on risky mortgage debt. When housing hit the skids and homeowners defaulted on their mortgages, this insurance would rise in value—and Mr. Paulson would make a killing. If he could convince enough investors to back him, he could start a fund dedicated to this trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Paulson and his team described their investment thesis to Nolan Randolph, an executive of a Texas firm Crestline Investors and an existing <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>. client, Mr. Randolph kept shaking his head. "We don't think your fund will add alpha," Mr. Randolph said, using the industry lingo for value. The downside was too big if the trade didn't pay off, he said. He turned them down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoping to claim his alma mater, <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span>, as an early client for his fund, Mr. Paulson traveled to Boston to meet with Mark Taborsky, who helped pick hedge funds for <span class="companylink">Harvard</span>'s endowment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Taborsky was wary. Mr. Paulson's fund was willing to lose 8% a year to buy the mortgage insurance, which seemed like a lot. Mr. Taborsky also thought Mr. Paulson might be excessively gloomy about the housing market. Mr. Taborsky turned him down, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some investors who agreed with Mr. Paulson's view that housing prices would tumble doubted he would make much money because there was relatively little trading in the investments he was buying. He might have a hard time selling his investments without sending prices tumbling, shrinking any profits, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It looked like a dangerous game, taking one single bet that might be difficult to unwind," said Jack Doueck, a principal at Stillwater Capital, a New York firm that parcels out money to funds. He, too, said no to Mr. Paulson's fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paulson's growing fixation on housing began to spark doubts about his business. One long-time client, big Swiss bank <span class="companylink">Union Bancaire Privée</span>, received an urgent warning from a contact that Mr. Paulson was "straying" from his longtime focus, and that the bank should pull its money from <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>., fast. The bank stuck with Mr. Paulson but turned down his new fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the summer of 2006, Mr. Paulson had managed to raise $147 million, mostly from friends and family, to launch a fund. Soon, Josh Birnbaum, a top <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> trader, began calling and asked to come by his office. Sitting across from Mr. Paulson, Mr. Pellegrini, and his top trader, Brad Rosenberg, Mr. Birnbaum got to the point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only were Mr. Birnbaum's clients eager to buy some of the mortgages that <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>. was betting against, but Mr. Birnbaum was, too. Mr. Birnbaum and his clients expected the mortgages, packaged as securities, to hold their value. "We've done the work and we don't see them taking losses," Mr. Birnbaum said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Mr. Birnbaum left, Mr. Rosenberg walked into Mr. Paulson's office, a bit shaken. Mr. Paulson seemed unmoved. "Keep buying, Brad," Mr. Paulson told Mr. Rosenberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Months into their new fund, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Pellegrini were eager to find more ways to bet against risky mortgages. Accumulating mortgage insurance in the market sometimes proved slow. They soon found a creative and controversial way to enlarge their trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They met with bankers at <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span>, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, and other firms to ask if they would create securities—packages of mortgages called collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs—that <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>. could wager against.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment banks would sell the CDOs to clients who believed the value of the mortgages would hold up. Mr. Paulson would buy CDS insurance on the CDO mortgage investments—a bet that they would fall in value. This way, Mr. Paulson could wager against $1 billion or so of mortgage debt in one fell swoop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>. wasn't doing anything new. A few other hedge funds also worked with banks to short CDOs the banks were creating. Hundreds of other CDOs were being created at the time. Other bankers, including those at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, didn't see anything wrong with Mr. Paulson's request and agreed to work with his team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span>, however, Scott Eichel, a senior trader, and others met with Mr. Paulson and later turned him down. Mr. Eichel said he felt it would look improper for his firm. "On the one hand, we'd be selling the deals" to investors, without telling them that a bearish hedge fund was the impetus for the transaction, Mr. Eichel told a colleague; on the other hand, <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> would be helping Mr. Paulson wager against the deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors later would argue that Mr. Paulson's actions indirectly led to the creation of additional dangerous CDO investments, resulting in billions of dollars of additional losses for those who owned the CDO slices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, though, Mr. Paulson still wasn't sure his trade would work. He simply was buying protection, he said. "We didn't create any securities, we never sold the securities to investors," Mr. Paulson said. "We always thought they were bad loans."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>. eventually bet against about $5 billion of CDOs. Months later, they had made more than $4 billion of profits from these trades—including $500 million from a single transaction—according to the hedge fund's investors and an employee of the firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest losers was the bank that worked with Mr. Paulson on many of the deals: <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>. The big bank had failed to sell all of the CDO deals it constructed and was stuck with chunks of toxic mortgages, suffering about $500 million of losses from these customized transactions, according to a senior executive of the German bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2007, Mr. Pellegrini took his wife on vacation in Anguilla. Stopping at an automated-teller machine in the hotel lobby to withdraw some cash, she checked the balance of their checking account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the screen before her was a figure she had never seen before, at least not on an ATM. It's not clear how many others ever had, either: $45 million, newly deposited in their joint account. It was part of Mr. Pellegrini's bonus that year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Wow," his wife said quietly, staring at the ATM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They left, arm in arm, meeting a chartered boat to take them to nearby St. Barts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paulson's personal tally for 2007: nearly $4 billion. It was the largest one-year payout in the history of the financial markets. The next year, he made another $5 billion for his firm by betting against financial companies with exposure to housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the middle of 2009, a record one in 10 Americans was delinquent or in foreclosure on their mortgages. U.S. housing prices had fallen more than 30% from their 2006 peak. In cities such as Miami, Phoenix, and Las Vegas, real-estate values dropped more than 40%. Several million people lost their homes. And more than 30% of U.S. home owners held mortgages that were underwater, or greater than the value of their houses, the highest level in 75 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Paulson and others at his office discussed how much was being spent by the United States and other nations to rescue areas of the economy crippled by the financial collapse, he discovered his next targets, certain they were as doomed to collapse as subprime mortgages once had been: the U.S. dollar and other major currencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paulson made a calculation: The supply of dollars had expanded by 120% over several months. That surely would lead to a drop in its value, and an eventual surge in inflation. "What's the only asset that will hold value? It's got to be gold," Mr. Paulson argued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>. had never dabbled in gold, and had no currency experts. He was also one of many warming to gold investments, worrying some investors. Some investors withdrew money from the fund, pushing his assets down to $28 billion or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paulson acknowledged that his was a straightforward argument, but he paid the critics little heed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Three or four years from now, people will ask why they didn't buy gold earlier," Mr. Paulson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He purchased billions of dollars of gold investments. Betting against the dollar would be his new trade.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">After the Boom; In the Exurbs, the American Dream Is Up for Rent</span>
</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>1210 words</div><div>31 March 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; A18</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PLANO, Ill. -- Kim and Robert Discianno had the American dream. Now, they rent a few streets away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Disciannos moved from Aurora, Ill., to their home here in Plano three years ago, lured to the outermost fringes of suburbs, known as the exurbs, by the promise of owning their first home. Today, their credit is shot and they no longer own, but Ms. Discianno still has a four-hour commute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Disciannos are among many exurban families losing their homes and their grip on the dream of home ownership. The exurbs were among the fastest growing counties during the boom -- entire civilizations built around the idea of owning real estate. With home prices falling and unemployment rising, more people are renting -- just as they had before the boom -- and turning the community into a rental economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting is one of the few ways for people to stay in the area and keep landlords afloat. It can be good for the overall economy because it promotes mobility. When the economy turns downward, renters are more willing than owners to move to a region where jobs are more plentiful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that same mobility can make for less stable communities and lower property values. Some observers believe the growth of rental property is the first in a series of steps that will transform today's exurbs into tomorrow's low-income housing. These communities have a low tax base made up mostly of property and sales taxes, both of which are in decline. Lawrence Summers, economic adviser to President Barack Obama, has often explained it this way: "No one in the history of the world ever washed a rented car."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is happening on the urban fringe is similar to the urban decay that plagued cities after World War II, says Christopher B. Leinberger, a real-estate developer and visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. "Single-family homes and townhouses in cities were broken into rental units. Now, we're seeing that phenomenon move out to the fringe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than three million homes have either been lost to foreclosure or a foreclosure-related sale between 2006 and 2008, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. And the decline in home prices and concentration of foreclosures is generally worse in outer-lying communities than in the central city or closer-in suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tug of home ownership in the exurbs changed how much of America lives and works. These outer-lying communities further popularized the "McMansion" and turned two-hour commutes into four. People didn't necessarily prefer to move so far out, but they did so for the promise of a home, a yard and tax-deductible interest payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many lower-salaried workers were able to afford their first home, while higher-paid professionals could trade up to a larger house with a big yard and a game room. About 17 million people, 5.6% of the U.S. population, lived in the exurbs in 2007, according to the Brookings Institution, compared with 14 million people in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kendall County, about 50 miles west of Chicago, was one of the fastest growing exurbs during the boom years. The county's population about doubled during the housing boom, to some 100,000 residents in 2008 from roughly 55,000 in 2000. As people moved in, starter homes and shopping centers rose among worn barns and silos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residents who came over the past few years have average incomes about 20% lower than established residents, according to an analysis of Internal Revenue Service data by Kenneth Johnson, senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire's Carsey Institute. About a third of Kendall County's labor force are in management and professional jobs, compared with 41% in nearby DuPage, an established suburban county where homes cost more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as the housing bust and recession has turned the exurbs from engines of growth to economic laggards, many of these families have the worst of both worlds. They are still on the fringes but have no equity. In many cases the amenities they hoped would follow -- new shopping centers, movie theatres -- have ceased construction or opened with only a few stores. Government projects like new schools and parks have also been delayed as budgets get cut and population growth has slowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Lakewood Springs development here where the Disciannos live, "For Sale" and "For Rent" signs are everywhere. A few have driveways littered with abandoned couches and stereos, and in some cases homeowners are living next to tenants paying half the cost of a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Couples like the Disciannos mirror the economic arc of the exurbs. With a no-money-down mortgage, the couple bought a $235,000 three-bedroom house in Plano, doubling Ms. Discianno's round-trip commute to more than four hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Discianno, an IT project manager for a Chicago law firm, says at first the trade-offs were worth it. At the family's apartment complex back in Aurora, Ms. Discianno says she often felt guilty about raising her two children in cramped quarters. On a few occasions, the neighbors complained when her daughter played hopscotch on a common walkway, and Ms. Discianno had to limit sleepovers to one friend for lack of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their house in Plano had a back yard and nearby jungle gyms. "We could actually own something and afford it," says Ms. Discianno, who was able to pay the early payments of $1,500 a month. It was great for the kids, she says. "Friends can come see them, instead of them always going somewhere else."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As land values rose, the couple's combined mortgage and property tax payment soared, to $2,900 from $1,500. Rather than struggle with the bills, the family abandoned their home to the bank, moved out, and found a new home to rent. They didn't have to look far: The Disciannos found a smaller home in the same development for $1,500. That home was owned by investors who had hoped to sell it -- but settled on renting it instead. The new home is about the same size as the apartment they used to rent, and sleepovers are again limited to one friend per night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many owners were initially concerned about renters. The homeowners' association at the Lakewood Springs development has restrictions on how rental properties can be advertised. But feelings have shifted with foreclosures turning occupied homes into vacancies that are worse for the local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Overall, a community of owners versus renters is obviously going to be better," said Tim Jones, a satellite television technician, and a friend of the Disciannos. But after four years of struggling to pay his own mortgage, Mr. Jones says he has no equity to show for it. He may end up walking away from his home, he says, which may end up turning him into a renter as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While she still owned a home, Ms. Discianno opposed renters and voiced concerns about them at a homeowners' association meeting. "I was very against it too," she says. "It doesn't do much for property values."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Matthews has a summer home there. So do John and Theresa Kerry, Jack Welch, and <span class="companylink">Google</span> boss Eric Schmidt. When the boom times rolled, the richest hedge fund managers simply wouldn't buy anywhere else. Nantucket is so upper crust that it makes nearby Martha's Vineyard look positively working class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you have ever wanted to buy a home in this cosseted enclave, now might be the time to start looking. The real-estate crash has even come ashore here. Prices have fallen by about a quarter or more from the peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The island has a glut of unsold homes, and even some foreclosures. Hardest hit of all? Vacant land. "The theory that land on Nantucket would always increase in value has been blown out of the water," says local Realtor Kate Ranney Sayle of Denby Real Estate. "Nobody wants to buy it. Right now, you can't give a vacant lot away."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007 the average lot of vacant land sold for $2.3 million, she says. Today? Try $395,000. In a crash of this scale, nowhere is spared. So much for all those people during the bubble who insisted "quality" and "high end" property would retain its value. According to the Case-Shiller index, average US home prices have fallen about 27% from their peak in early 2006. Nantucket tracks pretty closely to the trend. How the mighty have fallen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a couple of years ago, at the height of the hedge fund boom, the small island was gripped in a speculative frenzy. The richest hedge fund managers, who made their incredible fortunes just down the coast in Greenwich, Connecticut, bid aggressively for homes and land. A place on Nantucket became the latest trophy for the guys who had everything - including a private jet to fly them to and fro. Nantucket was hardly blue-collar to start with, but many locals complained that the new money was ruining the island. Overpriced bistros and frou-frou shops ran riot. Clam shacks gave way to the sort of restaurants where mashed potato is called "potato foam" and a sauce is an "emulsion." Average sales prices for homes doubled in a few years to $2.5 million. Land prices quintupled. Back then you couldn't find a home. Now you can't get rid of one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the peak of the market there were about 230 houses for sale," says broker Cynthia Lenhart of Compass Rose Real Estate. "There were lots of buyers and nothing to sell them. Now there are about 550 houses for sale, and not many buyers." There have even been foreclosures and short-sales, something almost unimaginable until now. Some were properties developed by speculators. But they've also included a prime commercial building on Main Street that was taken over by the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a familiar story in most real estate crashes: First the buyers vanish, then inventory piles up, and only then -- normally after a long and painful process of resistance -- do sellers get real and drop prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several Realtors, however, report a slight pickup in interest in recent weeks. There have been a few more visitors stopping by to see what's on the market. Of course it's easy to be skeptical. But mortgage rates are low, economic confidence has improved a little -- and of course the weather makes a weekend trip a slightly cheerier prospect than it was earlier this winter. But whether this turns out to be a false spring for prices is another matter. Nantucket, obviously, is not like other markets. There aren't too many forced sellers. But the laws of supply and demand function even here. So long as there is a big backlog of unsold properties on the market, buyers hold the cards.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As mortgage rates fall to near historic lows, some home builders are offering even lower interest rates, in an effort to lure buyers amid the slow spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest sales promotion: <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. is offering a fixed 3.625% rate over the life of a 30-year fixed rate mortgage. The deal is besting average rates that have fallen below 5% nationwide, but it comes as other builders are reporting mixed results from similar incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>.'s recent offer of a 3.99% rate sparked "underwhelming" interest from home buyers, says Dan Klinger, president of the builder's mortgage operation. "It wasn't like we needed crowd control," says Mr. Klinger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, luxury builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. was offering a 3.99% interest rate in many of its developments nationwide, but today that rate is no longer available nationally. Toll executives have said that the promotion boosted traffic to its Web site, but the low rate alone hasn't been enough to break weak consumer confidence that is still weighing on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bargain mortgage rates are the latest sales strategy from builders struggling to sell homes. Mounting unemployment continues dogging the sector, because people without jobs, or those afraid of losing one, are unlikely to purchase, no matter how low the rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the downturn began, builders have tried everything from free tropical vacations to subsidized closing costs in order to move inventory. They then cut costs and even offered layaway plans for down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For home buyers, the low mortgage rates from the builders represent significant savings. But be wary of the fine print: Lennar is offering the 30-year rate "on select homes," and the loan amount cannot exceed $417,000. The minimum credit score is 700, which is a relatively high score in the current environment. In addition, it could be hard for buyers to come up with the minimum 10% down payment that Lennar requires to qualify for the 3.625% rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builders' low rates may help first-time home buyers, "but it's not going to goose the trade-up market," says Thomas Lawler, a housing economist. "That's because most trade-up buyers use the equity from their previous home for a down payment, and that equity often doesn't exist any more."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KB Home</span> is one builder that isn't chasing buyers with low mortgage rates, for now. Instead, the Los Angeles builder is focusing on offering smaller houses that are competitively priced with foreclosed houses. The strategy seems to be helping KB, which reported on Friday that its sales improved more than some analysts expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some builders acknowledge that price cuts are the most effective way to move inventory, such cuts could cause buyers who have already bought a house at a higher price to walk away from their deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can be costly for builders to offer the low rates because the companies typically pay mortgage investors cash upfront in exchange for the low interest-rate loans. Federal regulations limit how much the builders can contribute to buy down mortgage rates. Currently, if a home buyer puts down 5% or less, the builder is limited to incentives worth 3% of the sales price, says Mr. Klinger. For downpayments of 10%, the limit climbs to 6%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Carrick Mollenkamp, Serena Ng and Liam Pleven </div><div>1223 words</div><div>30 March 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Commercial Real Estate; C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">American International Group Inc</span>., whose spending is being monitored by the Federal Reserve, has cut or delayed payments to some AIG real-estate ventures, potentially leaving shopping centers and apartment complexes across the U.S. short on cash to pay lenders and fund repairs and renovations, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affiliates of one real-estate firm, which teamed with AIG in a $2 billion purchase of a low-income apartment portfolio in 2007, have sued AIG for missed and delayed payments. Affiliates of the developer, Mitchell L. Morgan Management Inc., claimed in their lawsuit that they were told by AIG's top real-estate executive that "the current Federal Reserve funding arrangement with AIG does not provide for funding of AIG Global's commitments to its joint venture partners."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AIG also ceased payments to a partnership with an Alabama shopping-center developer, leaving the developer's bank lenders with potential losses, according to people familiar with the situation. Some 15 banks could end up with souring loans at a time when commercial-property losses already are increasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disputes show how unpredictable the government's role at AIG has become for the insurer's business partners. While big U.S. and European banks received payouts via a government bailout to settle contracts, some U.S. property developers have been left in the lurch. The government's involvement in the company has also roiled the insurance industry, where AIG has at times undercut competitors to win business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An AIG spokeswoman said the company is in discussions with two real-estate companies about the disputes. "Like other owners of commercial real estate, AIG [Global Real Estate] is working with its partners and lenders to resolve the challenges raised by current economic circumstances, particularly the difficulty of refinancing maturing debt," said the spokeswoman, Christina Pretto. Ms. Pretto said AIG is committed to the prudent use of taxpayer funds and that AIG is doing its best to make tough economic decisions. Ms Pretto added that the Fed hadn't been involved in how cash is dispersed and that AIG has limited resources and is making business decisions based on that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the center of the dispute is AIG Global Real Estate, an arm of the insurance company. AIG has received $173.3 billion in government bailout funds. Over the past two decades, the AIG real-estate business, using its insurance premiums and working with third-party investors, acquired property on its own or via developers. Today, the unit has interests totaling more than $23 billion, across 53 million square feet of real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the unit has joined with developers in the past, its stature and access to lenders made closing deals a snap. Once the partnership had acquired a portfolio, AIG provided money for renovations and to cover cash shortfalls needed to pay for operating costs. But late last year and early this year, payments were delayed, making it difficult for Morgan to make its own payments, according to the lawsuit filed in February by Morgan affiliates in a Pennsylvania state court. Ms. Pretto said AIG is in full compliance with its pact with Morgan and its affiliates, and all funding has been provided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AIG and Morgan, a King of Prussia, Pa., firm, teamed up in 2007 after AIG had missed out on closing a "mega real estate transaction," the lawsuit said. Stung by this, AIG teamed with Morgan, a veteran apartment manager, to close the purchase of 16,800 apartment units, mainly in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, from New York's Kushner family. AIG then agreed to provide $120 million as part of a four-year, $127 million renovation plan to put in new kitchens, appliances and bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But late last year, AIG's payments stopped flowing around the time the Fed on Nov. 9 boosted its bailout to $150 billion. During the second half of November, Morgan officials increasingly grew concerned when AIG payments were delayed, according to the lawsuit. On Nov. 21, AIG covered a September request for $2.8 million but didn't pay an October request for $3.1 million until later. On Nov. 24, Kevin Fitzpatrick, president of AIG's real-estate venture, emailed Mitchell Morgan to explain that without "supporting documentation," the Fed "would not make the money available to us until a new method was in place," Morgan's lawsuit claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two met in person on Dec. 11. Mr. Fitzpatrick was more specific, telling Mr. Morgan "the current Federal Reserve funding arrangement with AIG does not provide for funding of AIG Global's commitments to its joint venture partners," the lawsuit said. Mr. Fitzpatrick wasn't available for comment, an AIG spokeswoman said. The Fed has a direct role in certain of AIG's major cash disbursements. That includes real-estate investments. Government officials track 13-week rolling forecasts of AIG cash flow and meet daily with AIG officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its lawsuit, Morgan contends that if its partnership with AIG can't pay contractors, it could file liens on the properties, which would trigger a default with the banks that provided the partners money to buy the apartments. Lenders include <span class="companylink">Wachovia Corp</span>., now owned by <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp;Co</span>. A Wells spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AIG's Ms. Pretto said Friday that Morgan and AIG have agreed to suspend litigation for 60 days to negotiate a possible settlement. Ms. Pretto said AIG believes the complaint by the Morgan affiliates is without merit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alabama, in recent months, AIG opted to halt certain payments it had made in the past as part of a 16-year partnership with Birmingham developer Alex Baker, according to people familiar with the situation. The partnership, AIG Baker, has developed 20 million square feet of shopping centers, some of which have struggled recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to these people, AIG's exit created uncertainty about whether payments would continue to be made on bank loans used to buy property. Some 15 banks loaned about $600 million for property purchases. AIG has offered a settlement. A person close to the banks said the lenders were unlikely to accept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If AIG isn't there to provide cash-flow shortage payments, it is going to be difficult for AIG Baker to cover costs. Some shopping centers are lacking tenants and are cash-flow negative. AIG has offered to exchange some of the loan amount for preferred equity that would be senior to AIG's equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An AIG Baker spokesman referred questions to Ms. Pretto. Ms. Pretto said in a statement, "AIG Baker has offered the banks several loan restructuring options aimed at protecting the value of the portfolio and maximizing the likelihood that they will be fully repaid on the loans extended on those properties."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem for AIG Baker is that AIG in the past covered cash shortfalls that helped pay for the operations at the centers. However, AIG never contractually agreed to cover those costs, allowing the insurer to depart from past practices. AIG remains an equity stakeholder in AIG Baker.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Should Renters Jump Into the Housing Market? Is it the right time to buy a house? Our columnist weighs the pros and cons.</span>
</div><div class="author">By June Fletcher </div><div>949 words</div><div>28 March 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak but positive glimmers in the housing market over the past few days have left many renters wondering if they should finally take the plunge into the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I discussed this subject on a National Public Radio panel [http://www.onpointradio.org/shows/2009/03/bid-buy-rent-or-run/] with Susan Wachter, real estate and finance professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and real estate columnist and author Elizabeth Razzi. All of us agreed on the answer: It depends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your age and stage of life, the thickness of your wallet, your appetite for risk and local market conditions all play into the rent-or-buy equation. Although no one's circumstances are identical, here are some reasons to buy -- or not to buy:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUY BECAUSE:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government wants you to. To help shore up homeownership, the federal government has given first-time buyers (defined as anyone who hasn't bought a home within the last three years) an $8,000 tax credit, driven down interest rates to historic lows [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123811443939953525.html#mod=todays_us_money_and_investing], set up counseling centers to help financially troubled homeowners and spent billions to ensure mortgage money will be available to home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some states and localities are offering additional tax credits and other incentives to buy. And of course, homebuyers get a mortgage interest deduction, and a hefty capital gains tax exemption when they sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices will eventually recover. Although no one can predict with certainty when the housing market will reach bottom, over the long run pressures from immigration and the formation of new households (currently around 800,000 a year) will push home prices up. The longer you stay in your home, the more likely you will see equity build up. And most owners do stick around long enough to outlast economic downturns. Government data show that 50.2% of single-family owners stay put for at least a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your investment is leveraged. Even though lenders are requiring much greater down payments than they did during the boom, if you are borrowing money to buy your house, your investment is leveraged. In other words, if you put $10,000 in stocks, and it increases 10%, you've made $1,000. But if you put $10,000 down on a $100,000 home, and its value increases 10%, you've made $10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed properties offer instant equity. In some parts of the country, particularly in the South and West, foreclosures have pushed prices down dramatically. For instance, in February, California's existing home prices dropped 41% from a year before, to $247,590, according to the state's association of Realtors. But you need to pick and choose. Although you can't make too much money buying a foreclosure property in a neighborhood where they dominate—in those cases, the foreclosure price becomes the market price—if you buy one in a stable community with few distressed sales, you profit from the difference between what you paid and the market price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage costs can be fixed. If you get a fixed rate, your financing costs are predictable for the life of the loan. Meanwhile, your rent can be jacked up beyond what you expected or are able to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's yours. You have more control over the performance of a real estate investment than you do over stock investing. You can also add value by fixing it up. Plus, there are intangible benefits: Pride of ownership, the chance to feel that you've invested in a place and a community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON'T BUY BECAUSE:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's expensive and hard to move. If you're suddenly out of a job, being able to pack up and move quickly increases your employment prospects. But if you live in a city that's experienced massive layoffs, like Detroit, it may be extremely difficult to find a buyer for your home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your money is tied up. Lenders are now requiring substantial down payments, which cuts back on the amount of money available for alternative investments, as well as the amount of money you have available for emergencies. Not long ago, you could access this money easily through a home equity line of credit, but nervous lenders have been severely restricting these as home prices have plunged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure devastates your credit. If you find yourself unable to pay rent, you often can break a lease by negotiating a settlement with your landlord, without harming your credit. But if you go through foreclosure, your credit will be harmed for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning has unpredictable costs. The monthly costs of ownership are typically around 40% higher than the cost of the loan when you figure in repairs and maintenance, property taxes, and insurance. And though you may get a deal from a handyman who needs work in this bad economy, don't expect a break on property taxes. Even though assessments have been falling across the country, municipalities are raising property tax rates to offset decreased revenues. Because catastrophic storms have caused many insurers to raise premiums, homeowners insurance has also become increasingly expensive: According to a study by Westlake Village, Calif. marketing firm <span class="companylink">J.D. Power and Associates</span>, 42% of homeowners experienced an increase in premiums last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices could fall further. Although home prices will recover over the long term, they're likely to stay depressed or fall further in the short run. And in some places like New York, where the supply of homes for sale is limited, renting for the long-term might be cheaper than owning.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can home buyers trust the floor they are standing on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to gigantic government efforts to support the mortgage market, house prices are showing signs that they mightn't have much further to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices have to be built on more than cheap financing. Indeed, government leverage could set the stage for another downdraft if the wider economy doesn't recover fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharply lower house prices and ultracheap mortgages were bound to spark bargain hunting. Government intervention in credit markets has helped push down rates on standard, fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages to 4.85%. That is the lowest level since <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s records began in 1971. After months of decline, house prices jumped 1.7% in January from December, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was a small sign the vicious circle in housing can be broken. Policy makers fear the more prices fall, the more likely it is that underwater borrowers choose to default, increasing foreclosures and forcing prices down even further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sustained house-price recovery could eliminate that fear, while bolstering confidence across the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And one key indicator supports hopes for a house-price rally. The National Association of Realtors' affordability index, which moves up as the cost of housing falls relative to income, is 67% higher than its low during the recent housing bubble. What's more, it is 52% above its level at the end of 1991 -- when house prices started rising after the 1990-91 recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, two countervailing forces could thwart a rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, borrowers mightn't want to take on more mortgage debt while personal balance sheets are still stressed, something not reflected by the affordability index. At the end of last year, personal disposable income covered 75% of household liabilities. In 1991, it was 114%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, rising unemployment could continue to take a heavy toll. It makes the employed more cautious about large purchases, but unemployment does most damage by driving foreclosures higher -- even among borrowers with sounder personal balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delinquency data aren't encouraging. In particular, defaults are now rising on loans made before 2006 -- when lending standards started to deteriorate sharply. In January, Alt-A loans made in 2005 had a cumulative default rate of 4.2%, up from 0.64% a year earlier, according to First American CoreLogic. The default rate on 2005 prime mortgages that didn't qualify for purchase by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> was 0.56% in January, up from 0.07% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>'s 2005 mortgages, most of which should have been conservatively underwritten, are suffering unusually high default rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given this backdrop, the government will be tempted to keep stepping up mortgage subsidies. The risk: Buyers are lured in by artificially cheap financing, only to find the house-price floor subsequently gives way.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Christina S.N. Lewis </div><div>573 words</div><div>27 March 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; W8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Candy Spelling, the widow of television producer Aaron Spelling, is offering her Los Angeles mansion for $150 million -- apparently the most expensive home for sale in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Spelling, who produced a string of hits over five decades from "Charlie's Angels" to "Beverly Hills, 90210," died at the 123-room house in 2006 at age 83. Last year, his widow, a former model, said she planned to "downsize" to a $47 million condominium on the top two floors of a building in the Century City district. At that time, it was reported that she was looking at offers for her house in the $150 million range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Spelling's current, 57,000-square-foot house, dubbed "the Manor" and featured on guided tours of Hollywood mansions, includes a bowling alley, a beauty salon, a gift-wrapping room and a screening room whose screen rises out of the floor, with paintings moving up to reveal the projector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Spellings bought the nearly five-acre property, at one time the home of Bing Crosby, in the early 1980s, tore down the house and rebuilt. When completed in 1991 it was considered the largest home in Los Angeles by far. Sally Forster Jones of Coldwell Banker Previews has the listing together with Jeffrey Hyland and Rick Hilton, both of Hilton &amp;Hyland/Christie's Great Estates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The record for most expensive U.S. home is a matter of some debate. Investor Ron Baron bought 40 acres of vacant land in East Hampton, N.Y., for $103 million in 2007. Last year, Donald Trump sold a Palm Beach, Fla., home for $95 million to a Russian billionaire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Ms. Spelling announced her planned move to Century City, she's fielded roughly a dozen calls from qualified buyers, including some hotel investors, estimates Stephen Goldberg, her attorney. She didn't consider lowering the price. "The ones who could afford it three years ago, can still afford it today," he says. $150 million "is not a lot."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imus Asks $30 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radio host Don Imus last week put his Connecticut waterfront country compound up for sale for $30 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10,000-square-foot white clapboard Georgian Revival main house is in Westport, a suburban community 48 miles northeast of Manhattan. The 16 rooms include six bedrooms and six baths, with white-painted wood interiors and multiple bay windows. Also on the four acres is a two-bedroom guest house and a two-bedroom gatehouse with parking for six cars. The property has 215 feet of sandy beach frontage, and a pool could be built, the listing says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Imus, 68 years old, bought the property in 1997 for $4.6 million and completed his home in 2000, according to the listing. He briefly listed the home in 2005 for the same price. Darlene Letersky, of Fine Homes Connecticut, has the listing. The town record is the $25 million sale in 2006 of talk-show host Phil Donahue's home, according to Charles Zylstra of Nicholas Fingelly Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Imus declined to comment. While broadcasting "Imus in the Morning," which airs on ABC Radio Networks, Mr. Imus last week announced that he's battling Stage II prostate cancer; that diagnosis indicates the disease hasn't spread.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market is showing signs of a thaw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes rose in February for the first time in seven months, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday, fueled by higher activity in the South and West, where deals on foreclosures and other "distressed" properties, particularly in California, are helping to drive interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data "have allayed some fears that the housing market would continue to free-fall," said Omar Sharif, an economist with RBS Greenwich Capital, "but it's way too early to say if we've hit bottom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday marked the third consecutive day of positive news in the housing market, a contrast to the drumbeat of bad news in recent months. On Tuesday, a government gauge of home prices posted its first gain in almost a year, while Monday brought news that sales of previously owned homes, the biggest share of the market, also increased last month -- particularly among first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes rose 4.7% last month to a 337,000 annual rate, though they still are down sharply compared with this time last year. Falling prices and low mortgage rates are helping to stir buying activity, along with the government's $8,000 tax credit, part of the recently passed stimulus bill, for buyers who purchase a home before Dec. 1. The number of new homes for sale -- some 330,000 units -- is the lowest in almost seven years, a sign builders are beginning to work through bloated inventories after cutting back on new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, new homes are more expensive than existing ones, which could hamper their sales ability in the coming months. The median sales price for a new home was $200,900 last month, down from $251,000 in February 2008, but still high compared with the median sales price of an existing home last month of $165,400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, data Wednesday showed that orders for manufactured goods rose last month for the first time since July, another signal that the U.S. recession isn't deepening. The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured durable goods -- items such as autos, furniture and appliances designed to last three years or more -- rose a seasonally adjusted 3.4% last month to $165.6 billion, the first monthly gain since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's rise in orders, however, only partially reverses January's revised 7.3% drop, which is sharply lower than first estimated, and orders are still down nearly a quarter from the previous year. A key gauge of business spending -- orders for capital goods excluding defense and aircraft -- also rose after posting a revised 11.3% plunge in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, inventory levels of durable goods declined last month, a sign that the jump in orders is helping to pare bloated inventories, paving the way for a future increase in production. But households are likely to remain under pressure for some time: After the 2001 recession, for example, which ended in November of that year, the unemployment rate continued to climb through mid-2003. Economists still expect the unemployment rate, currently 8.1%, to flirt with double digits later this year or next.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Wednesday, the California Association of Realtors said existing-home sales in the state were up 83% in February from the previous year, as the median home price was down some 40%, helping to shrink inventories to about a six months' supply from 15 months last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bette Zerba, a real-estate agent in Phoenix, said a high level of foreclosures is prompting similar activity in her area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought the market looked spectacular right now and wanted to take advantage of it," said one of Ms. Zerba's clients, Rosanna Fischer, 40 years old, a first-time home buyer. She offered $175,000 on a 2,000-square foot bank-owned home with a pool in Glendale, Ariz., last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes nationwide rose 4.7% last month to a 337,000 annual rate, though they still are down sharply compared with this time last year, and increased competition from cheaper existing homes could hamper their sales ability in the coming months.

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Commercial Property Faces Crisis; Delinquency Rate at 1.8%, Near Peak of Last Recession; Parallels to S&amp;L Debacle</span>
</div><div class="author">By Lingling Wei </div><div>1407 words</div><div>26 March 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Commercial Real Estate; A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real-estate loans are going sour at an accelerating pace, threatening to cause tens of billions of dollars in losses to banks already hurt by the housing downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delinquency rate on about $700 billion in securitized loans backed by office buildings, hotels, stores and other investment property has more than doubled since September to 1.8% this month, according to data provided to The Wall Street Journal by <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>. While that's low compared with the home-mortgage delinquency rate, it's just short of the highest rate during the last downturn early this decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts say it now looks as if the current commercial real-estate slump will rival or even exceed the one in the early 1990s, when bad commercial-property debt played a big role in dragging the economy into a recession. Then, close to 1,000 U.S. banks and savings institutions failed. Lenders took about $48.5 billion in charges on commercial real-estate debt between 1990 and 1995, representing 7.9% of such debt outstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since late 2007, a total of 47 banks and savings institutions have failed, of which a dozen or so had unusually high commercial-mortgage exposure. Foresight Analytics in Oakland, Calif., estimates the U.S. banking sector could suffer as much as $250 billion in commercial real-estate losses in this downturn. The research firm projects that more than 700 banks could fail as a result of their exposure to commercial real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial property may not be hit as hard as many fear if the economy pulls out of recession more quickly, driving up rents and occupancy rates. And greater availability of financing -- a key goal of the Obama administration -- could lift property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>., one of the biggest mall owners, has been teetering on the brink of a bankruptcy filing and recently failed to repay maturing loans on two shopping centers in Hayward, Calif., and Humble, Texas, according to Trepp, a firm that tracks the commercial-property debt market. John Hancock Tower in Boston is being sold in a foreclosure auction. Recent additions to the list of properties with delinquent mortgages include an office building in Stamford, Conn., a hotel in Las Vegas and a shopping center in Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Souring Loans</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem was underscored when Moody's Investors Service downgraded <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. Wednesday, citing likely increases in souring "credit cards, residential and commercial real estate loans." The bank declined to comment on the downgrade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real-estate debt is potentially more dangerous to the financial system than debt classes such as credit cards and student loans because of its size. The Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group, estimates that commercial real estate in the U.S. is worth $6.5 trillion and financed by about $3.1 trillion in debt. Partly because the commercial real-estate debt market is nearly three times as big now as in the early 1990s, potential losses in dollar terms loom larger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to an analysis of bank financial reports by The Wall Street Journal, the broad shift to real-estate lending can be seen by comparing commercial real-estate loans -- including both mortgages and construction loans -- with banks' so-called Tier 1 capital, a key indicator of a bank's ability to absorb losses. In 1993, less than 2% of the nation's banks and savings institutions had commercial real-estate exposure exceeding five times their Tier 1 capital. By the end of 2008, that had risen to about 12%, or about 800 financial institutions. A higher ratio means a thinner cushion for loans that go sour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve and the Treasury are moving to adapt a funding program to make it attractive for investors to buy debt backed by office buildings, hotels, stores and other income-producing property. The program, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, was begun to finance purchases of debt backed by consumer credit, and officials will expand its use to include commercial-property debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed is an institution that traditionally makes short-term debt available. In TALF, federal loans run three years, already a duration Fed officials are uncomfortable making. But even that might not be long enough to spur investor demand for commercial mortgage securities, which typically mature over 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate industry executives have been trying to resolve these issues with Fed and Treasury officials in meetings led by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span>, say people familiar with the matter. The government officials are considering extending the TALF to accommodate the needs of the commercial real-estate industry but no decisions have been made. In a statement Monday, the Treasury suggested the Fed might alter the terms of its loans to investors to make them more attractive for long-term securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey DeBoer, CEO of the Real Estate Roundtable, said, "The danger is a repeat of what happened on the residential side: A complete choking up, foreclosure disasters and increased stress on the banking system."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recently as last summer, delinquency rates on commercial mortgages were at historically low levels, and many experts thought problems wouldn't be as bad in this downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Worst of Times'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But owners could borrow so much on the expectation of rising property values and cash flows that some are at risk now that rents and occupancy are falling. "In just seven months, we've gone from the best of times to the worst of times," said Richard Parkus, head of commercial mortgage securities research at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some performing loans could face trouble because of a fall in values of the properties, making it hard for owners to refinance when loans come due. Currently, many banks are agreeing to grant short-term extensions on loans. But "that's just kicking the can down the street for awhile," said William Rudin, an owner of New York City office buildings. "That doesn't solve the problem."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of $154.5 billion of securitized commercial mortgages coming due between now and 2012, about two-thirds likely won't qualify for refinancing, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> predicts. Its estimate assumes declines in commercial-property values of 35% to 45% from the peak in 2007. That would exceed the price drops in the downturn of the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank estimates the default rates on the $700 billion of commercial-mortgage-backed securities could hit at least 30%, and loss rates, which figure in the amounts recovered by lenders, could reach more than 10%, the peak seen in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides securities backed by commercial real-estate loans, about $524.5 billion of whole commercial mortgages held by U.S. banks and thrifts are expected to come due between this year and 2012. Nearly 50% wouldn't qualify for refinancing in a tight credit environment, as they exceed 90% of the property's value, estimates Matthew Anderson, partner at Foresight Analytics. Today, lenders generally won't loan over 65% of a commercial property's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast to home mortgages -- the majority of which were made by only 10 or so giant institutions -- hundreds of small and regional banks loaded up on commercial real estate. As of Dec. 31, more than 2,900 banks and savings institutions had more than 300% of their risk-based capital in commercial real-estate loans, including both commercial mortgages and construction loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">First Bank of Beverly Hills</span> in Calabasas, Calif., the amount of commercial-property debt outstanding was 14 times the bank's total risk-based capital as of the end of last year. Delinquencies reached 12.9%, compared with the average of 5% among the nation's banks and thrifts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In perfect hindsight, we would have done less commercial real-estate lending," said Larry B. Faigin, president and CEO. The bank this month announced a deal with a leveraged-buyout and restructuring firm in Chicago, Orchard First Source Asset Management, under which Orchard will provide new capital. Within two years after the deal closes, First Bank will significantly reduce its concentration in commercial real-estate lending and have less than half of its assets in the sector, Mr. Faigin said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Home sales in the Midwest fell again in February as doubts about the economy and tighter credit requirements stymied potential buyers, according to two reports released Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in the 12-state region slid 18% from February last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. The median price in the Midwest declined 8% to $131,000 -- the second-smallest drop of any region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, nationwide home sales slipped 10% from a year ago, without adjusting for seasonal factors, while prices tumbled almost 16% to $165,400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales fell in 11 of 12 major Midwestern cities with seven of those plummeting by more than 20% from prior-year levels, according to the Associated Press-Re/Max Monthly Housing Report, also released Monday. The survey includes all home sales recorded in the metropolitan statistical area by all local agents, regardless of company affiliation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago; Wichita, Kan.; Indianapolis; Des Moines, Iowa; and Kansas City, Mo., posted the biggest losses in the region, dropping by 25% or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only Midwestern city seeing an annual increase in sales was Detroit, where deeply depressed home prices have brought in a truckload of investors and other bargain hunters. Overall sales increased 5% in February while the median sale price fell 50% -- the biggest drop in the country -- to $41,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in Chicago plummeted by 65% in February from a year ago, one of the worst showings in the nation, according to the AP-Re/Max report. The median home sale price has also fallen, declining 23% to $179,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Israel Fuentes, a real-estate agent with Home Center in Chicago, said buyers who would normally have taken advantage of lower home prices are now staying out of the market, afraid that prices will continue to crater. He said the problem has only worsened as more homes go into foreclosure or are being sold short -- that is for less than the balance on the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have never seen so many short sales," Mr. Fuentes said. "Everything that is selling is mostly short sales. There are huge, huge, entire neighborhoods that have basically plummeted [in value]."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those stressed sales make it virtually impossible for regular sellers to put their properties on the market for good prices, even in higher-valued neighborhoods, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everywhere has been touched and affected," he said. "Properties that I sold for $410,000 a year ago now go for $120,000."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sean Christie, an agent with Century 21 Realty Group in suburban Indianapolis, said the market isn't quite as dire in his area. According to the AP-Re/Max report, sales in the Indianapolis market fell 29% in February while the median sale price fell 15% to $93,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Christie said he has seen fewer buyers than normal and believes it's partly because lenders have increased their requirements for mortgages, forcing potential buyers to provide more documentation on income and other financial factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Fargo, N.D., the problem has been less financial and more meteorological, said Kris Sheridan, an agent with Park Company. Blizzards struck frequently on weekends this winter, keeping home shoppers indoors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in Fargo fell 25% in February compared with a year ago, according to the AP-Re/Max report. But the median sale price has remained relatively steady, declining only about 2% to $139,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sheridan said there were few subprime mortgages in Fargo and foreclosures aren't affecting home prices. Still, she said the economic woes affecting much of the country have scared away some potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think there's a lot of fear," she said. "There's not a lot of good news and that makes people become more conservative about their purchasing power."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the market for first-time home buyers has been a bright spot, especially after the federal government began offering an $8,000 tax credit to first-time buyers as part of the new economic stimulus plan.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Hernando de Soto </div><div>1070 words</div><div>25 March 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Opinion; A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration has finally come up with a plan to deal with the real cause of the credit crunch: the infamous "toxic assets" on bank balance sheets that have scared off investors and borrowers, clogging credit markets around the world. But if Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner hopes to prevent a repeat of this global economic crisis, his rescue plan must recognize that the real problem is not the bad loans, but the debasement of the paper they are printed on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's global crisis -- a loss on paper of more than $50 trillion in stocks, real estate, commodities and operational earnings within 15 months -- cannot be explained only by the default on a meager 7% of subprime mortgages (worth probably no more than $1 trillion) that triggered it. The real villain is the lack of trust in the paper on which they -- and all other assets -- are printed. If we don't restore trust in paper, the next default -- on credit cards or student loans -- will trigger another collapse in paper and bring the world economy to its knees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you think about it, everything of value we own travels on property paper. At the beginning of the decade there was about $100 trillion worth of property paper representing tangible goods such as land, buildings, and patents world-wide, and some $170 trillion representing ownership over such semiliquid assets as mortgages, stocks and bonds. Since then, however, aggressive financiers have manufactured what the Bank for International Settlements estimates to be $1 quadrillion worth of new derivatives (mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and credit default swaps) that have flooded the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These derivatives are the root of the credit crunch. Why? Unlike all other property paper, derivatives are not required by law to be recorded, continually tracked and tied to the assets they represent. Nobody knows precisely how many there are, where they are, and who is finally accountable for them. Thus, there is widespread fear that potential borrowers and recipients of capital with too many nonperforming derivatives will be unable to repay their loans. As trust in property paper breaks down it sets off a chain reaction, paralyzing credit and investment, which shrinks transactions and leads to a catastrophic drop in employment and in the value of everyone's property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since humans started trading, lending and investing beyond the confines of the family and the tribe, we have depended on legally authenticated written statements to get the facts about things of value. Over the past 200 years, that legal authority has matured into a global consensus on the procedures, standards and principles required to document facts in a way that everyone can easily understand and trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is a formidable property system with rules and recording mechanisms that fix on paper the facts that allow us to hold, transfer, transform and use everything we own, from stocks to screenplays. The only paper representing an asset that is not centrally recorded, standardized and easily tracked are derivatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property is much more than a body of norms. It is also a huge information system that processes raw data until it is transformed into facts that can be tested for truth, and thereby destroys the main catalysts of recessions and panics -- ambiguity and opacity. To bring derivatives under the rule of law, governments should ensure that they conform to six longstanding procedures that guarantee the value and legitimacy of any kind of paper purporting to represent an asset:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- All documents and the assets and transactions they represent or are derived from must be recorded in publicly accessible registries. It is only by recording and continually updating such factual knowledge that we can detect the kind of overly creative financial and contractual instruments that plunged us into this recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- The law has to take into account the "externalities" or side effects of all financial transactions according to the legal principle of erga omnes ("toward all"), which was originally developed to protect third parties from the negative consequences of secret deals carried out by aristocracies accountable to no one but themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Every financial deal must be firmly tethered to the real performance of the asset from which it originated. By aligning debts to assets, we can create simple and understandable benchmarks for quickly detecting whether a financial transaction has been created to help production or to bet on the performance of distant "underlying assets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Governments should never forget that production always takes priority over finance. As Adam Smith and Karl Marx both recognized, finance supports wealth creation, but in itself creates no value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Governments can encourage assets to be leveraged, transformed, combined, recombined and repackaged into any number of tranches, provided the process intends to improve the value of the original asset. This has been the rule for awarding property since the beginning of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Governments can no longer tolerate the use of opaque and confusing language in drafting financial instruments. Clarity and precision are indispensable for the creation of credit and capital through paper. Western politicians must not forget what their greatest thinkers have been saying for centuries: All obligations and commitments that stick are derived from words recorded on paper with great precision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Above all, governments should stop clinging to the hope that the existing market will eventually sort things out. "Let the market do its work" has come to mean, "let the shadow economy do its work." But modern markets only work if the paper is reliable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government's main duty now is to bring the whole toxic environment under the rule of law where it will be subject to enforcement. No economic activity based on the public trust should be allowed to operate outside the general principles of property law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial institutions will have to serve society and fully report what they own and what they owe -- just like the rest of us -- so that we get the facts necessary to find our way out of the current maze. They must begin learning to put on paper statements about facts, instead of statements about statements.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers flooded the U.S. real-estate market last month, seizing on increased affordability and driving home sales to their biggest monthly gain in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The big complaint during the housing-market boom years was that middle-class home buyers were priced out," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. "Now that prices are declining, it's giving them a chance to enter the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group said its gauge of previously owned home sales, which make up about 85% to 90% of the total market, rose in February after a sharp decline in January. Sales jumped a seasonally adjusted 5.1%, the biggest one-month gain since late 2003, to a 4.7 million annual sales pace. Condominium sales were particularly strong, while sales of single-family homes rose 4.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying activity was strongest in places such as Southern California, Las Vegas, Arizona and Florida, which have a glut of foreclosures. So-called "distressed" properties, which are typically priced about 20% below normal market prices, made up nearly half of home sales last month. That is helping to push down home prices overall. The national median home price was $165,400 last month -- down more than a quarter from its peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically low mortgage rates of around 5%, which are also helping to boost affordability, are expected to stay down as the Federal Reserve continues to focus on interest rates. The Realtors' group keeps a separate index of housing affordability that jumped in January to its highest since tracking began in 1970.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those conditions are helping to attract first-time home buyers to the market, a sign that confidence in the housing market is stabilizing. First-time buyers accounted for half of last month's home sales, based on a survey of Realtors, and activity was seen mostly in the lower price ranges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flood of distressed properties into the market is expected to continue through next year, which will likely keep prices low and also means rising inventories. Inventories jumped in February to 3.8 million homes available for sale, compared with 3.6 million in January, a 9.7 months' supply at the current sales pace. Inventory levels in a healthy market are usually around five to six months' supply.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOUNTAIN HOUSE, Calif. -- California's mortgage crisis hit this master-planned community particularly hard last year, and eventually 90% of mortgage holders here owed more than their homes were worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But residents are allowing themselves the first twinges of optimism amid the gloom. The 2,600 existing homes in this development 60 miles east of San Francisco are selling at nearly three times last year's pace. One builder has sold about 30% more homes in 2009 than a year ago. And homeowners here are seeing the welcome return of another phenomenon: the bidding war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Catrina Koleva and her husband found their dream home listed here for $299,900 in February, they figured they would try to win the five-bedroom spread. Instead, they faced 12 other bidders and gave up. The winning bid was 30% over asking price, said Tabari Palmer, a representative of the listing agent. "I think people are seeing there are some pretty good values here," Ms. Koleva said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one wants to call a bottom in Mountain House after what happened. Home prices have fallen more than 50% from their peak amid masses of foreclosures. (The home Ms. Koleva wanted last sold for $781,900 in January 2007.) But 48 homes have sold so far this year and another 59 are in escrow, compared with just 19 sales in the year-earlier period, said MetroList Services Inc., an industry-tracking firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the hint of new life, Little League participation has grown to 220 from 178 last year. "People I see here have as much hope as I've seen in a long time," said Lemuel Vergara, principal of the local Wicklund Elementary School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mountain House's nascent revival is representative of a phenomenon playing out here and there around California, offering glimmers of wary optimism as fallen home prices and interest rates entice buyers. <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes Inc</span>., one of Mountain House's builders, reported a "marked" increase in its California sales this year from last. January existing-home sales doubled from January 2008, according to the California Association of Realtors, and sales are still growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California homes were on the market an average 6.7 months in January, compared with 16.6 months in January 2008, the Realtors association said. Nationwide, it was 9.6 months. In Tracy, a city of about 80,000 people next to Mountain House, there are 900 homes for sale, down from 1,800 a year ago, said Tracy Mayor Brent Ives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, economists say California is leading a resurgence in the West of existing-home contracts. January contracts signed in the 13 states stretching from New Mexico to Wyoming to Alaska to Hawaii rose 13.5% from a year ago, compared with a nationwide decline of 6.4%, the National Association of Realtors estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of California's strongest housing resurgence is in the hard-hit Central Valley, where Mountain House lies. In Stockton, which had the country's highest foreclosure rate, sales year-to-date were 1,331 homes on March 18, up from 501 in the year-ago period, MetroList said. In the Sacramento suburb of Elk Grove, sales over the same period rose 54% to 192 from 125; in Modesto, sales rose to 702 from 320. "It really does look like we are getting to the end of this," said Jerry Nickelsburg, senior economist at the Anderson Forecast, an economics think tank at UCLA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few economists say California's housing debacle is over, and things could even get much worse. The state's unemployment rate of 10.5% in February is likely to rise, they say. So are foreclosures, which rose 5% in February from the month before, according to industry researcher RealtyTrac Inc. The median home price in California fell 57% to $254,350 in January from $594,530 in May 2007, and prices continue to drop in many places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is another potential time bomb: What happens when banks put on sale the thousands of homes they have repossessed, but kept off the market?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a nagging question in Mountain House, where about 280 homes have been taken off the market since the first of the year, many of them foreclosures. "We can't reach a bottom in the housing market until all of the foreclosures get processed," said Tom Beede, chief executive of MetroList.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mountain House has fallen so hard that even a slowing rate of descent gives residents a reason to see some light. When Mountain House sprouted out of a farm field near Tracy in 2003, some people camped in line to snap up houses. Home values soared to more than $700,000, peaking in early 2007 before they collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Mountain House had gained notoriety as the most-underwater community in America, with nine of 10 of borrowers owing more than their homes' values, according to First American CoreLogic, a real-estate-data firm. Banks foreclosed on hundreds of homes, prompting an exodus of residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, buying slowly started picking up, as people like Larry and Kathleen Wishart began to bet that prices were now a bargain. They paid $335,000 for a four-bedroom, 2.5-bath home that sold for more than $600,000 in 2006. "Had the market not dropped, we could not have afforded to move here," Mrs. Wishart said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have declined more since then, but buyers aren't waiting around for further discounts. A year ago, most sales were well below asking price. Now, many are close to asking. Broker Leo Apostol says he is representing buyers of two four-bedroom homes, both in escrow for more than the asking price: One is listed at $305,000 and drew four offers; another is listed at $294,950 and drew two offers. "When you have multiple offers, that usually means prices will go up" eventually, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Koleva, who lost out on her first dream home, said she and her husband, who live in a rented home here with their two young boys, have looked at 30 other homes here and expect to find a good buy soon. "We're not desperate," she said, but "we really like Mountain House. It's a great place to raise a family."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Downpayment Insurance Could Stabilize Home Prices</span>
</div><div class="author">By Peter Niculescu  and Beth A. Wilkinson </div><div>559 words</div><div>21 March 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Opinion; A9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the government's housing policy to date has focused on helping struggling homeowners stay in their homes and resolving the problems caused by declining asset values. Both are important. But unless policies encourage people to buy houses and work off the current inventory backlog, house prices will continue to tumble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One step toward this goal is to stabilize housing prices by reducing the risk of buying a home with little or no cost to the taxpayer. One solution is a government-sponsored downpayment insurance program for new home buyers. This could bring responsible home buyers back into the market and create a floor for home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how the program would work. Home buyers could purchase insurance for their downpayments: To qualify, they would have to keep the home for at least five years. The insurance policy would be written on an assessment of average home values in the neighborhood. If a homeowner can maintain or improve the home and sell it for more than his neighbor's, he gets any profit above the original purchase price. If home prices are lower when he sells, the homeowner gets to keep the downpayment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To mitigate the risk to the taxpayer, the policy should be capped at 25% of the home value. Larger downpayments would not be fully insured, nor would larger declines in home prices. The program we're outlining is meant to temporarily stabilize home prices. Thus it should have a relatively short life, perhaps two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much will it cost taxpayers? Maybe nothing. Housing is going through a powerful correction but will revive over time, and the economy will too. If, as is most likely, the insurance helps to arrest the drop in home prices before five years are up, taxpayers will pay no claims but keep the premiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if prices do keep dropping, the cost will likely be less than most of the other stimulus measures being proposed. To incur a monetary cost to the taxpayer, the person who bought a home over the next two years would have to sell it, and average prices in his neighborhood beyond five years would have to fall. Most homeowners at that point would choose to stay in their homes, knowing their downpayment is still safe. For those who are at risk of default and have to sell, the taxpayer will make payments straight into their pockets, reducing the chance of foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that point, downpayment insurance becomes an automatic stimulus package that only kicks in when it is really needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since virtually all conforming mortgages are now being underwritten by an arm of the government (the Federal Housing Administration, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>) the taxpayer is already exposed to the risk of default. For the Federal Housing Administration programs in particular, the government is bearing the full risk of further home price declines on home purchases with loan-to-value ratios frequently above 90% or 95%. This program merely extends the taxpayers' exposure by a fraction: the downpayment on home purchases going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Niculescu, a financial consultant, is the former head of capital markets at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. Ms. Wilkinson, an attorney, is the former general counsel of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the hint of new life, Little League participation has grown to 220 from 178 last year. "People I see here have as much hope as I've seen in a long time," said Lemuel Vergara, principal of the local Wicklund Elementary School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mountain House's nascent revival is representative of a phenomenon playing out here and there around California, offering glimmers of wary optimism as fallen home prices and interest rates entice buyers. <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes Inc</span>., one of Mountain House's builders, reported a "marked" increase in its California sales this year from last. January existing-home sales doubled from January 2008, according to the California Association of Realtors, and sales are still growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California homes were on the market an average 6.7 months in January, compared with 16.6 months in January 2008, the Realtors association said. Nationwide, it was 9.6 months. In Tracy, a city of about 80,000 people next to Mountain House, there are 900 homes for sale, down from 1,800 a year ago, said Tracy Mayor Brent Ives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, economists say California is leading a resurgence in the West of existing-home contracts. January contracts signed in the 13 states stretching from New Mexico to Wyoming to Alaska to Hawaii rose 13.5% from a year ago, compared with a nationwide decline of 6.4%, the National Association of Realtors estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of California's strongest housing resurgence is in the hard-hit Central Valley, where Mountain House lies. In Stockton, which had the country's highest foreclosure rate, sales year-to-date were 1,331 homes on March 18, up from 501 in the year-ago period, MetroList said. In the Sacramento suburb of Elk Grove, sales over the same period rose 54% to 192 from 125; in Modesto, sales rose to 702 from 320. "It really does look like we are getting to the end of this," said Jerry Nickelsburg, senior economist at the Anderson Forecast, an economics think tank at UCLA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few economists say California's housing debacle is over, and things could even get much worse. The state's unemployment rate of 10.5% in February is likely to rise, they say. So are foreclosures, which rose 5% in February from the month before, according to industry researcher RealtyTrac Inc. The median home price in California fell 57% to $254,350 in January from $594,530 in May 2007, and prices continue to drop in many places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is another potential time bomb: What happens when banks put on sale the thousands of homes they have repossessed, but kept off the market?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a nagging question in Mountain House, where about 280 homes have been taken off the market since the first of the year, many of them foreclosures. "We can't reach a bottom in the housing market until all of the foreclosures get processed," said Tom Beede, chief executive of MetroList.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mountain House has fallen so hard that even a slowing rate of descent gives residents a reason to see some light. When Mountain House sprouted out of a farm field near Tracy in 2003, some people camped in line to snap up houses. Home values soared to more than $700,000, peaking in early 2007 before they collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Mountain House had gained notoriety as the most-underwater community in America, with nine of 10 of borrowers owing more than their homes' values, according to First American CoreLogic, a real-estate-data firm. Banks foreclosed on hundreds of homes, prompting an exodus of residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, buying slowly started picking up, as people like Larry and Kathleen Wishart began to bet that prices were now a bargain. They paid $335,000 for a four-bedroom, 2.5-bath home that sold for more than $600,000 in 2006. "Had the market not dropped, we could not have afforded to move here," Mrs. Wishart said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have declined more since then, but buyers aren't waiting around for further discounts. A year ago, most sales were well below asking price. Now, many are close to asking. Broker Leo Apostol says he is representing buyers of two four-bedroom homes, both in escrow for more than the asking price: One is listed at $305,000 and drew four offers; another is listed at $294,950 and drew two offers. "When you have multiple offers, that usually means prices will go up" eventually, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Koleva, who lost out on her first dream home, said she and her husband, who live in a rented home here with their two young boys, have looked at 30 other homes here and expect to find a good buy soon. "We're not desperate," she said, but "we really like Mountain House. It's a great place to raise a family."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in <span class="companylink">General Electric Co</span>. will get a more detailed picture of what the world's largest landlord holds in its commercial real-estate portfolio when GE's finance arm updates investors on its businesses and financials Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the disclosure mightn't ease doubts about whether the Fairfield, Conn., conglomerate is owning up to the potential losses it faces from those investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies have been clobbered by steep declines in the value of office buildings, apartments, stores, hotels and other commercial property. The Dow Jones REIT index has slid 60% in the past 12 months. Private-equity firms that specialize in real estate are reporting losses of as much as 60% for funds invested recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GE has been much more generous in its approach to its holdings. So far, GE has said its $34 billion in property could fall in value by about 1.5% this year, amounting to a pretax loss of as much as $500 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When values were rising, real estate used to be a major earnings machine for GE's finance arm. By selling a few buildings, the company could immediately recognize profits. But, with the sales market at a virtual standstill, profits are plummeting and the risk of losses is increasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A GE spokesman declined to answer questions about the company's real-estate portfolio, citing plans to make an "in-depth public presentation" Thursday. But in the past GE executives have said that, under accounting rules, the company doesn't have to "mark to market" its real-estate holdings as other investors do. In other words, the company doesn't have to value its properties at what they would be worth if they were sold today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? GE says because properties are long-term investments, the company should book losses in terms of potential drops in cash flows and their expected long-term decline in value. Also, about 80% of its real-estate holdings were purchased with cash and have no mortgages. That means that, unlike other highly leveraged property investors, GE runs very little risk of having to sell properties to pay off creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many on Wall Street believe GE's approach doesn't sufficiently recognize the damage the recession is doing to commercial real estate, which is expected to get steadily worse. Last week, GE lost the triple-A credit rating it first achieved more than five decades ago, as <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> lowered its view on GE's long-term debt by one notch, to double-A-plus. The bond-rating firm cited, among other concerns, GE's "large exposure" to commercial real estate in light of "mounting strains" in this sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, GE may still be too optimistic even using its more-conservative approach for estimating losses, analysts say. Looking at cash flow and long-term declines in value, the company's portfolio may lose a lot more than $500 million, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If commercial real-estate prices are down between 20% and 30% from the peak, it's not too hard to see that the downside could be a lot more than $500 million," said analyst Richard Hofmann at CreditSights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash flow is a big problem right now for landlords, including GE, because vacancies are rising and rents are falling at nearly unprecedented rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, as job losses accelerated, vacancies at office towers increased 0.8 percentage point to 14.5% in the fourth quarter, the largest one-quarter jump since the second quarter of 2001, and likely will rise to 16.7% this year, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office and retail leases can run for as many as 15 years, meaning that landlords that sign deals today are locking in lower rents -- and lower values -- for the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, GE's portfolio is vulnerable to steeper losses partly because the company bought so much at the top of the market. According to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a research firm in New York, GE sold $7 billion of real estate world-wide in 2007 but acquired $16.6 billion that frothy year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of GE's 2007 deals appear to be turkeys. For example, in July 2007, GE bought nine office complexes in Chicago from Blackstone Group LP for $1.05 billion. Those properties had been owned by <span class="companylink">Equity Office Properties</span>, which Blackstone acquired for $39 billion at the beginning of 2007 and then sold off in large chunks. Vacancy is rising at most of those properties, according to real estate firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Oakbrook Terrace Tower, a prominent 31-story building that is close to the finest shopping and restaurants in suburban Chicago, the vacancy rate has jumped to 33% today from about 16% at the time GE bought the property, according to <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, vacancies at the Equity Office properties acquired by GE have risen to more than 25% from 19%, according to the real-estate research firm in Bethesda, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Chicago market, almost half of the office buildings showed rent declines in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have never seen this kind of marked acceleration in the number of office properties willing to lower rents to prevent further deterioration in occupancy," says Reis research director Victor Calanog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his annual letter to shareholders, GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt offered a frank view on the company's real-estate holdings: "Today, I wish we had less exposure to commercial real estate."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Tom Herman </div><div>1306 words</div><div>18 March 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Taxes; D3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(See Correction &amp;Amplification below [cx].)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recently enacted economic-stimulus law contains an unusually attractive new tax break for many homebuyers -- if they can only figure out how it works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new law sweetens a provision known as the "first-time homebuyer credit." In essence, if you meet certain qualifications, such as buying a home from Jan. 1 through Nov. 30 this year, you may be eligible for a tax credit of as much as $8,000. You also have a choice of claiming the credit on your federal income-tax return for 2008 or 2009. A credit is typically more valuable than a deduction, since it eliminates your taxes on a dollar-for-dollar basis -- and in this case, you may get it even if you don't owe any taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Congress made the homebuyer-credit fine print so devilishly tricky that many Americans are likely to have to pay an expert for help in deciphering it. "We've had numerous calls because people are confused," says Claudia Hill, owner of Tax Mam Inc., a Cupertino, Calif., tax-services firm. "The problem is when things are this complicated, many people don't get the benefits that Congress intended for them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internal Revenue Service officials recently issued a revised form and instructions. Even so, Nancy Mays of <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block Inc</span>., the Kansas City, Mo.-based tax-preparation company, describes the credit as "crazy complex."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are answers from IRS officials and tax advisers to some questions about the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Who can claim the credit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: In general, the IRS says you may be eligible if you bought your main home, located in the U.S., after April 8, 2008, and before Dec. 1, 2009 -- and if you (and your spouse, if you're married) haven't owned any other main home during the three-year period ending on the date of purchase. That means you might be eligible even if you owned a home for many years before that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, there are numerous other qualifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: How much is the credit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: That depends on when you bought the home and other factors, such as your income and the home's price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you bought during the 2008 period and qualify for the credit, the maximum credit is generally $7,500. But it's only half that amount if you're married and filing separately from your spouse. Even though it's called a credit, it's really an interest-free loan. You generally have to repay it over a 15-year period, without interest, in 15 equal installments, the IRS says. (There are several exceptions to this repayment rule. We warned you this was tricky.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rules are more generous if you buy a new home during the 2009 period and meet all the qualifications. In that case, the maximum amount generally is $8,000, or half that amount if you're married filing separately. More important, you don't have to repay the credit at all unless that home "ceases to be your main home within the 36-month period beginning on the purchase date," the IRS says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, there was some confusion about whether the $8,000 maximum credit would apply if someone bought a home in 2009 and chose to claim the credit on their return for 2008. It's now clear the $8,000 maximum limit does indeed apply, says Mark Luscombe, principal tax analyst at CCH, a <span class="companylink">Wolters Kluwer</span> business. Naturally, though, "this doesn't help people who actually bought homes in the 2008 qualifying period, and who are limited to a $7,500 credit that must be repaid," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the credit generally is limited to the amounts mentioned above -- or 10% of the home's purchase price, whichever is less. For example, if you bought a new home this year for $70,000, the maximum amount of the credit would be limited to 10% of that amount, or $7,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: How do the income limits work?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: You may be eligible for the full amount of the credit if your adjusted gross income, with certain modifications, is $75,000 or less -- or $150,000 or less if married and filing jointly. However, the credit begins to disappear, or "phase out," if your income exceeds those amounts. You can't claim the credit at all if your income is $95,000 or more, or $170,000 or more if married and filing jointly, the IRS says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What if I built a new home? How does that work?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: You are considered having purchased it "on the date you first occupied it," the IRS says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: I own more than one home. How do I figure out which is my "main" home? And does it have to be a house?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: The IRS says your main home is "the one you live in most of the time." No, it doesn't have to be a house. It can be "a house, houseboat, house trailer, cooperative apartment, condominium, or other type of residence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Are there are other qualifications?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Yes. You can't claim it if your home is located outside the U.S. You also aren't eligible if you're a nonresident alien, if you inherited the home or got it as a gift, or if you acquired it from a "related person," such as your spouse, parents or grandparents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Will the credit help me if I don't owe any tax?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Yes. The credit "may give you a refund" even if you owe no tax, the IRS says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What form do I use?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Form 5405. The IRS recently revised it and posted it on its Web site (www.irs.gov[http://www.irs.gov]), along with instructions. Dean Patterson, an IRS spokesman, says "programming is being done to electronically process Form 5405" to claim the $8,000 credit for homes bought in 2009. The IRS "will be able to process these returns electronically beginning March 30" this year, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Where do I put the credit on my Form 1040?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Line 69.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: I've already filed my return for 2008. Can I still claim it? If so, how?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Yes. File what's known as an "amended" return. Use Form 1040X, and attach Form 5405.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: If I buy this year, should I claim the new credit on my 2008 or 2009 tax return?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: That can be tricky, and you may need to consult a tax pro. In general, most people who buy this year and qualify for the new credit probably will want to take it on their tax return for 2008, says Tax Mam's Claudia Hill. "They'll get their money more quickly," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some people might be better off claiming the credit on their 2009 returns. These would include eligible homebuyers who buy this year, whose financial circumstances changed during 2009 and who might qualify for a larger credit on their returns for 2009 than the prior year. An example would be someone whose income was too high to get any of the credit for 2008 but who recently lost his job and thus would be eligible for the full credit on his 2009 return, to be filed next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* * *</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Briefs: The IRS says it received a total of about 63.9 million individual income-tax returns this year through March 6. That was up 0.7% from the same period through March 7. ... Electronically-filed returns rose about 6% to 51.8 million.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater and Brian Blackstone </div><div>404 words</div><div>18 March 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. government on Tuesday reported a rebound in home construction and rising wholesale prices last month, the latest in a string of data showing firmer demand amid the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction surged by a seasonally adjusted 22% in February from the previous month following seven consecutive declines, as apartment construction soared and single-family home-building edged higher, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction data are often volatile month to month, but analysts are hoping February's rebound is the beginning of a sustained rise in activity, which would help boost ailing U.S. economic growth this year. The number of building permits issued in February also rose, a promising sign for future construction activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet some are wary a rebound in home construction will only add to the glut of inventories, particularly new homes at higher prices. Sales of new homes have fallen for six consecutive months through January and are down nearly 50% from January 2008, while inventories have ballooned to a supply of 13.3 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other difficulties remain: U.S. gross domestic product is expected to fall 5% or more in the current quarter, following a 6.2% annualized drop in the fourth quarter that was the biggest decline in a quarter century. The current recession, which began in December 2007, will become the longest since the Great Depression if it lasts through next month, as is widely expected. The unemployment rate, now 8.1%, is the highest in 26 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But U.S. wholesale, or "producer," prices rose for a second-straight month in February, the Labor Department said Tuesday, easing worries about the risk of protracted, economy-wide price declines known as deflation. That should in turn free up Federal Reserve officials, whose two-day policy meeting began Tuesday, to continue pursuing expansionary policies to stabilize financial markets and revive the economy while holding interest rates near zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for finished goods rose 0.1% from January, though prices are down 1.3% from a year ago, the biggest annual drop since 2002. Excluding energy and food, core prices rose 0.2% and are up 4% from a year ago. Consumer prices, set for release Wednesday, will give a broader reading on price pressures that U.S. households face.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hugh Hefner and his wife, Kimberley Conrad Hefner, who have lived in adjacent mansions since their 1999 separation, are listing Ms. Hefner's Los Angeles home for $28 million.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>606 words</div><div>13 March 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest private landowner in downtown Los Angeles said it may have to file for bankruptcy protection, the latest sign of how the credit crunch has frozen a multibillion-dollar revitalization of the city's downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Meruelo Maddux Properties Inc</span>. said Thursday that it was working to reach agreements with four lenders after the developer stopped making interest payments on 26 loans valued at $266 million. Three of those loans are due, and the company hasn't been able to extend them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The debt capital markets have totally shut down," Andrew Murray, the company's chief financial officer, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the latest shoe to drop for Los Angeles's downtown district, which has been the focus of a decade-long renewal project designed to convert old warehouses and office buildings into lofts, high-rise residential towers and an entertainment and retail district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major pieces already are in place, such as the Staples Center sports complex at the south end and the Frank Gehry-designed <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> Concert Hall at the north end. The first phase of L.A. Live, an entertainment complex, opened in December. And developers have added thousands of new condominiums and rental apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some plans have stalled, threatening the goal of building out the surrounding area. The Related Cos., a national developer, missed a city deadline to break ground on a $3 billion condo and retail corridor. The first phase of the project, once slated to be completed this year, probably won't be finished before 2012 because the developer hasn't been able to secure financing. Related says the project is on hold temporarily. "When things pick up a little, downtown will do very well," said William A. Witte, president of Related of California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, as in other cities, the condo market has been hurt by slow sales. Condo prices in downtown Los Angeles fell to less than $400 per square foot in the fourth quarter of 2008, down $100 from the previous year, according to <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meruelo Maddux, which owns land but has done little development, has reached 50% occupancy on its first luxury rental building, Union Lofts, which opened in mid-2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meruelo is late on completing a 35-story apartment building, adjacent to L.A. Live, that is due to open this fall. The company said it will keep making debt-service payments on that project, which it originally had planned to open in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meruelo is trying to sell its buildings to pay down debt and to persuade its lenders to restructure loans, but said that if those options fail, a bankruptcy filing could be a "strategic alternative."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives say they remain committed to the idea of residential development in downtown Los Angeles. "Downtown L.A., the economy aside, will continue along its evolution unabated because so much has already occurred," Mr. Murray said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike in Miami or San Diego, the downtown area doesn't have a large supply overhang. Real-estate brokerage Marcus &amp;Millichap forecasts that 39 new condo and 394 rental units will be added to the downtown market this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the district's troubles may reflect economic headwinds that have battered real estate nationally, some experts say downtown has also suffered from too many high-priced developments. "The price points that were projected aren't sustainable," said Raphael Bostic, a real-estate professor at the University of Southern California. "The prices you have to charge now make the returns relatively unattractive."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Christina S.N. Lewis </div><div>974 words</div><div>11 March 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; C8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(See Corrections and Amplifications item below [cx].)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price tag keeps growing for <span class="companylink">Apollo Management LP</span>'s acquisition of <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>, the nation's largest residential real-estate brokerage business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leon Black's Apollo picked almost the absolute peak of the housing market to take <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> private in a highly leveraged $8.5 billion deal, which was announced in late 2006. One of Apollo's funds invested $919 million in the deal, according to a fund summary reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with the residential brokerage business in the trauma unit with the rest of the housing industry, Apollo has agreed to pump in as much as $150 million to keep it afloat through 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that pledge, announced two weeks ago, raises a big question: Will $150 million be enough to save <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> during the worst housing downturn since the Depression?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apollo and <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> executives say yes. <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s Chief Executive Richard A. Smith notes that the company has cut costs by $350 million over the past three years and is trying to take advantage of the tough times by increasing market share, such as the launch of the Better Homes &amp;Gardens Real Estate brand. "Housing is a very cyclical industry," he said in an interview. "We've been preparing for this."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it isn't going to be easy. <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> is parent to Coldwell Banker, Century 21, <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> and other major brands. Its 16,000 affiliated offices doing business in 92 countries and 50 states all depend on the strength of the housing market -- which few project will turn around anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out-of-Balance Sheet</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s balance sheet is precarious. Last year, <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s revenue tumbled by $1.14 billion to $4.72 billion. The company generated $109 million of cash from operations after paying $627 million in interest expense. As of Dec. 31, the company had $113 million available on its $750 million revolving loan as well $402 million in available cash. But it isn't clear that this stockpile plus the $150 million Apollo is making available will be sufficient if revenue continues to plummet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While bondholders were reassured by Apollo's $150 million infusion, <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> bonds continue to trade at extremely distressed levels -- as little as 11.5 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAxess, reflecting investors' concern the company may file for bankruptcy soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Their profitability has eroded significantly both because of steady price declines and volume declines in the last couple over years," says <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> analyst Lenny Ajzenman. He downgraded the company's debt to just three notches above default in December; few companies with a viable capital structure have lower ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apollo's decision to put up $150 million into the struggling venture raised eyebrows in the private-equity world, where fund investors are resistant to throwing good money after bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apollo recently succeeded in raising nearly $15 billion for its latest fund. But the $9 billion fund that owns the <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> stake has spent most of its money, according to the fund summary. An Apollo spokesman declined to comment. In a statement, Marc Becker, a partner in the firm, acknowledged the "challenging task" facing <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s management and the "extremely difficult time in housing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the market is grim. Home resales fell to a 12-year low in January according to the National Association of Realtors, alongside a 14.8% slide in median home price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some regions of the country are seeing a surge in home sales, particularly suburban areas in which lenders are dumping large volumes of foreclosed homes at highly discounted prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Urban Blight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many of <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s operations are in urban regions, where there is more of a standoff between buyers and sellers, reducing sales activity to a trickle. The firm's brokerages and its franchises have offices in all 50 states, but Coldwell Banker -- one of the company's largest revenue generators -- is concentrated in urban areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, which handled $18 billion in home sales in 2007, operates in the once-robust New York City, Hamptons and Palm Beach, Fla., markets. In New York, transaction activity was down roughly 50% in February, compared to the same month in 2008, according to Brown Harris Stevens's President Hall Willkie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another danger is high-producing brokers jumping ship. To assure brokers that the company is solid, Mr. Becker, fellow Apollo executive Ali Rashid and <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s Mr. Smith organized a town meeting in February with Corcoran and Sotheby's management, held in the headquarters of Sotheby's auction house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to shore up <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s balance sheet last year, Apollo attempted a debt swap -- essentially a gambit that asks bondholders to trade in their existing securities for new notes, often with worse terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that strategy was stymied by Carl Icahn, who has battled or befriended Mr. Black on numerous deals. Mr. Icahn's High River investment firm owns a portion of Apollo's notes, which stood to lose their place in line if the offering went through, and successfully sued to block the exchange in December. In the suit, Mr. Icahn charged that <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> was "deeply insolvent" and default virtually "inevitable." <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> executives have denied this and have pointed out that the company has met all of its financial obligations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the normally hot spring selling season begins, two houses in the Inland Empire region of Southern California sum up the big problem facing many of the nation's largest home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the houses, a four bedroom built in 2006 that was seized by a lender in a foreclosure action, is listed for sale at $229,900. Meanwhile, in the same housing development, <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. is trying to sell a new house that looks nearly identical for $299,000, or 23% more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or consider <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes Inc</span>.'s predicament in Henderson, Nev., near Las Vegas. The builder is trying to sell a new, four-bedroom house for $214,990, while a home owner is trying to dump a similar house, which Pulte built two years ago, for $149,999. That price is less than the owner's mortgage under a "short sale" approved by the lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many markets, "we are no longer competing with other builders. We are competing with foreclosures," said Steve Ruffner, president of the Southern California division of <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of used homes are actually rising in some regions because of foreclosures, but new-home sales fell to a four-decade low in January, down 77% from their peak in summer 2005. Altogether, home builders sold houses at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 309,000 units in January, down from a peak of 1.4 million in July 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are confronting the competition from foreclosures at a difficult time in their history. Small builders are dying by the dozens, while some large companies are staying afloat by cutting expenses and scrambling to restructure debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama's foreclosure-prevention plan is likely to help stem the supply of bank-owned houses somewhat, and the administration's proposed budget would extend builders a lifeline through a lucrative tax break. But the foreclosure problem won't disappear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know how the builders are going to compete," said <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> analyst Daniel Oppenheim, who downgraded his ratings for Centex Corp. and <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> stock last week, partly out of concern about foreclosure competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is particularly vexing because many buyers are bypassing new houses for foreclosed ones that are virtually new and are often located in the companies' own developments. "Buyers think they are going to get the best bargain with a foreclosed house, and they aren't even looking at new homes," said Graham Holmes, owner of Reviron Realty, which sells bank-owned properties in the Inland Empire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders' responses to the foreclosure threat vary. Los Angeles-based <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> is focusing on building smaller, lower-priced houses that can compete with foreclosures head on. The builder has shrunk its house size from an average of 3,200 square feet during the housing boom to an average of 1,600 square feet in many markets today. "We're finding that if we can get a product to market that is priced competitively with foreclosures, [we] can sell pretty well, even in these times," said Jeffrey Mezger, KB's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas-based Centex, on the other hand, says it's not trying to beat lenders on price. Instead, the nation's third largest builder by volume is trying to entice buyers with perks like mortgage interest rates as low as 4.25%, energy-efficient designs and warranties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> also offers incentives, including covering the buyer's closing costs, and touts a $10,000 California tax credit for buying a new house. And it notes that buyers often need to spend money to fix up foreclosed properties before they can move in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders also argue that while they may look alike, new and foreclosed houses aren't comparable. "Our brand-new homes appeal to the buyer who wants up-to-date features, a chance to make their own selections like carpeting and paint colors," a Pulte spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers clearly agree. "A foreclosure is like a used car," said Danny Hernandez, who bought a new, $237,000, five-bedroom KB house in Beaumont, Calif., in the hard-hit Inland Empire. Mr. Hernandez, a 41-year-old warehouse worker, said the fact KB paid his closing costs and a nonprofit group subsidized his down payment helped make the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another strategy: build in new neighborhoods that aren't filled with vacant, bank-owned houses. "In general, we try not to compete with foreclosures," said Centex Chief Executive Tim Eller. "It's not all about price, it's about value. Buyers determine value by the look and feel of the neighborhood."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KB said its smaller houses are selling well, but the prices keep sinking. In November, KB was selling its line of smaller houses at a development in Beaumont for as little as $207,990. Now, it has dropped its starting price to $169,990 to match recent foreclosure values in Beaumont. Since it opened the Highland Vista development last summer, KB has sold 28 homes out of about 110 house lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts question how low builders can go before building a house costs more than they can charge for it. In some markets in California and Florida, builders have reached that point and have stopped building.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(See Correction &amp;Amplification below.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now it's all about balance sheets. That's why U.K.-based real-estate advisory firm Savills is the best of a bad bunch in the property sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares in other property advisory companies, such as <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> and DTZ, have fallen an average of 80% in the last 12 months amid fears they will struggle to meet debt obligations as the global property market has slumped. But Savills has outperformed. Its shares have fallen 34% compared to a 68% drop in the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index, thanks to its net cash position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean its business model is perfect -- far from it. An assumption that the good times would continue indefinitely meant Savills made a $54 million acquisition 18 months ago to enter the U.S. property market. That unfortunate decision meant it had to write down £45.4 million ($62.7 million) against acquired businesses in full-year results Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also overexposed to property transaction volumes that have all but dried up due to the lack of credit for buyers. Transactions, both commercial and residential, account for 37% of Savills's revenue but less than 9% of group profits, a figure that's set to fall still further as there's no sign of an imminent recovery in the investment market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, for the moment, investors are focused on companies' financial strength and ability to survive. With net cash of £46 million and £80 million of committed bank facilities until October 2011, the market is willing to overlook what could be seen as rash spending by Savills on global expansion and overexposure to a fast-disappearing income stream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans for further global expansion are now on hold as the company focuses on cutting costs and increasing exposure to areas such as facilities management and planning. These have lower margins than investment deals, but are a safer bet in a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its strong balance sheet, Savills can weather a prolonged slump in transaction volumes. But at 14 times estimated 2009 earnings, investors are already pricing in much more than just survival.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, I found my home of the future. Or, what it might be if I started from scratch and had $4 million to spare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This "New American Home" was showcased at the International Builders Show in Las Vegas earlier this year and boasted plenty of cosmetic perks -- from a luxe roof deck and outdoor kitchen to a master bath with a spa-like tub featuring changing colors and music. But it was the less glam stuff hidden behind the walls (and on the roof and in the basement) that I coveted most. The house's thermal shell was toasty: thick spray foam insulation under the roof deck, and exterior walls constructed with air-tight insulated concrete. The hot-water system was tricked out with tankless water heaters and solar technology to let the sun heat the swimming pool, as well as provide electricity. And an internal home-automation system ran the TVs, stereo and security systems from one central interface -- or an iPhone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a far cry from the 1978 post-and-beam construction I bought six years ago with its power-guzzling old appliances, analog TV roof antenna, sagging pieces of fiberglass insulation and door frames leaking so much air in the winter that the dog's fur ruffled when she walked by. Back then, "energy efficiency" and "green" building were still environmentalists' lingo and housing prices seemed like to only go up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the median age of the American home is 36 years, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and like millions of others, I'm in the midst of "future-proofing" my house so it doesn't become an edificial dinosaur amid fast-changing new building science and a hemorrhaging home-sales market. New regulations, like California's recent move to reduce formaldehyde emissions from composite wood products such as those used in kitchen cabinets, are contributing to the urgency and sparking established manufacturers to transform product lines. Financial incentives are helping too, from "green" homeowner-insurance policies to expanded tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements in the new federal economic-stimulus package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And these dwellings aren't just for the wealthy: The average new green home is 2,477 square feet and costs $296,600, according to a recent study by <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill Cos</span>. Spending a bit more on such upgrades can pay off in immediate energy savings and a higher resale price down the road. One-third of home buyers say they are willing to pay a premium of $20,000 or more for a green home, according the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Five or 10 years ago, people didn't wonder, 'What can we do to insulate or what sort of lighting to use to save energy?'" says Gary Drake, owner of Los Angeles-based Drake Contractors Inc. "It was more like, 'Why am I spending all this money on insulation?'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Mr. Drake estimates, a quarter of his remodeling clients request energy-efficient lighting and appliances as well as paints and cabinetry built with fewer volatile organic compounds (VOCs), solvents that can cause environmental and health problems. He is currently remodeling his own home with low-energy LED (light-emitting diode) lights and nontoxic denim insulation (like what's found in blue jeans). "I know when I go to sell it these are all things I can say I did. And I'll know I can get top dollar for my house," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are five remodeling "future-proofing" tips experts recommend. Before you...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. . . . Tear down sheetrock or take off siding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figure out where you can beef up insulation, particularly in exterior walls, basements and attics. Today there are multiple forms of insulation, many promoted as "green," including soy-based foams, loose-fill cellulose (recycled newsprint) and denim. Go for the highest R-value (thermal resistance) -- typically, the bigger the number, the better the insulation -- you can afford and fit with proper installation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Batt or blanket insulation is often cheapest; fiberglass is still widely used. The main drawback is that batts must be trimmed to fit around pipes and fixtures, leaving spaces susceptible to air leaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loose-fill insulation made of fiberglass and cellulose can flow better around wires, pipes and other obstructions. Spray-in, expanding foam insulations do a particularly good job at this and don't settle or sag over time, though are often pricier because of the materials' high R-values. Many are urethane-based but some now substitute petroleum content with soybean material. "Fill the cavity any time a wall is open," says Bruce Harley, author of "Insulate and Weatherize."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. . . . Replace kitchen cabinets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inquire whether materials contain added urea formaldehyde, which is used in the adhesives of certain pressed-wood products, including those used to make kitchen cabinets. Formaldehyde has been classified as a human carcinogen by the World Health Organization and the National Cancer Institute recommends that "buyers should ask about the formaldehyde content" of such products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Formaldehyde Council Inc., a group of formaldehyde producers and users, says that at the low levels to which people are exposed there "is essentially no risk" and that formaldehyde-based products are harmless when used as directed. However, starting this year, California began regulating formaldehyde emissions from composite wood products sold in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More mainstream wood-product manufacturers are adjusting product lines. <span class="companylink">Armstrong World Industries Inc</span>. is developing a line of cabinetry boxes with no added formaldehyde.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Columbia Forest Products Inc</span>., a large manufacturer of formaldehyde-free hardwood plywood, has organized a network of green fabricators to make it easier to find products like cabinets and furniture built without formaldehyde. "Consumers are asking for products that don't emit VOCs into their kids' rooms or kitchens, and that are made with environmentally accountable materials," says Todd Vogelsinger, Columbia Forest Products' director of marketing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. . . . Buy a new hot water heater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider going "tankless" or investing in solar technology to bolster your system. On-demand or "tankless" hot-water heaters fire up only when you turn on the hot-water tap. As water runs through the heater, it's warmed instantly by an electric or gas-fired mechanism. Such appliances are considered more efficient in many cases than standard water-heater tanks, which continually consume energy to heat and store water you don't use most of the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, a growing number of homeowners are enlisting the sun to help heat their water. U.S. installations of solar water-heater systems nearly tripled between 2005 and 2007, and some states, such as Hawaii, are beginning to mandate them in new homes. What's more, residential solar water-heating systems can qualify for a 30% federal tax credit, while qualified tankless hot-water heaters can earn up to a $1,500 federal credit; there also may be state incentives.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. . . . Build a new media room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make sure it's designed to meet the future of home technology. Can wiring support a centrally located media-distribution system that feeds Internet access, movies, games and music to the rest of the home? Can you control lighting, security, and heating and air conditioning from a touch screen or remotely from a cellphone or PDA?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gone are the days of just making sure you have enough outlets to run the stereo, TV and DVD player. Fast-advancing home-automation technology in every aspect of life means one day, refrigerators and other appliances will be more efficient and interconnected to relay problems to homeowners or central repair databases. <span class="companylink">General Electric Co</span>., for one, now sells an Energy Monitoring Dashboard (www.ge.com/yourhome[http://www.ge.com/yourhome]) that tracks home indoor energy and water consumption and emissions, and can be integrated with solar technology, thermostats and music to pipe throughout the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 76 million baby boomers beginning to approach retirement, home tech will increasingly communicate with outside health-care providers. And it all will require proper planning and wiring to prevent information overload. While the upfront costs can be more, it can pay off to hire an electronic-residential-design pro to plan along with your contractor.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. . . . Paint a wall or refinish the floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Products that contain few or no volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are one of the fastest-growing segments of the $21 billion paint and coatings market. VOCs are solvents that disperse into the air as paint dries, and have long been used to help it spread evenly and adhere to surfaces. But VOCs, which are largely responsible for that new-paint smell, can contribute to smog as well as kidney and liver damage, respiratory and memory problems and other illnesses, particularly in children. While you don't need to rush out to repaint if your walls are in good shape (most VOCs dissipate after 30 days), home buyers increasingly are asking if these coatings have been used in residences. Plus, low-VOC paints are generally healthier for your family while painting is going on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They typically cost the same as regular paints or just a few dollars more per gallon. You can also find low-VOC water-based urethane finishes for wood flooring. Some states, such as California, have already strictly limited the VOC emissions of paints sold there, and the federal government is expected to propose tightening its restrictions later this year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A forecasting gauge of housing-market activity fell more than twice as much as was expected in January as some buyers held off on home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of previously owned homes dropped 7.7% to 80.4 in January from 87.1 in December, the industry group said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected pending sales would fall 3.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending home sales index in January was 6.4% lower than the 85.9 it was in January 2008, and the NAR index is at its lowest level since tracking began in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even with many serious potential home buyers on the sidelines waiting for passage of the stimulus bill, job losses and weak consumer confidence were a natural drag on home sales," Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said. "We expect similarly soft home sales in the near term, but buyers are expected to respond to much-improved affordability conditions and from the $8,000 first-time buyer tax credit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR on Tuesday also revised its pending home sales index for December downward. The index rose 4.8% in December instead of the initially estimated 6.3% increase, the group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR index is based on pending sales of existing homes, including single-family homes and condominiums. A home sale is pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't closed. Pending sales typically close within one or two months of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, seasonally adjusted pending sales in the Northeast dropped 12.7% in January from December; they were down 19.7% since January 2008. Midwest activity fell 9.2% in January from December; it has fallen 13.8% since January 2008. Activity in the South fell 11.9% in January from December; it has fallen 9.1% since January 2008. In the West, pending sales rose 2.4% in January from December; they're up 13.5% since January 2008.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday echoed the bleak assessment of private economists who warn the U.S. is likely to fare worse this year than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The recent near-term indicators show little sign of improvement," the Fed chairman said in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, referring to reports that the recession that began in December 2007 is deepening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross domestic product plunged at a 6.2% rate in the final quarter of 2008, the Commerce Department said last week, the steepest slide since the early 1980s. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost more than half its value since its October 2007 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. economists predict GDP will decline at a 7% annual rate in the current quarter and 3% in the April-through-June period, according to a report Monday. They said the unemployment rate, currently 7.6%, is likely to hit 10% by the end of next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> chief economist Joseph LaVorgna is even more downbeat, releasing an updated forecast Tuesday warning that GDP could decline at an 8% annual rate in the current quarter -- the biggest drop in half a century -- resulting from sharply lower business spending and inventory levels. He added that "we would not be surprised" if GDP declined at closer to a 10% annual rate, and said he doesn't expect growth to return until the final three months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported Tuesday that its gauge of future home sales, based on contracts signed in January, sank 7.7% from December to a reading of 80.4, the lowest since tracking began in 2001. Signed contracts, or "pending" home sales, declined in the Northeast, Midwest and South, while rising slightly in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama offered his sober assessment of the economy Tuesday, saying the first quarter "holds out little promise," but he tried to stoke confidence in his economic-stimulus package. The president was speaking to government employees at the Department of Transportation headquarters in Washington as he announced the awarding of the first highway-construction contracts from the stimulus plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president recently signed the $787 billion stimulus bill that includes infrastructure spending, aid to states and tax cuts. Approval came almost entirely without Republican support in Congress. Chairman Bernanke -- who served for a time as President George W. Bush's top economist in 2005 and early 2006 before becoming Fed chairman -- appeared to express approval for the bill Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By supporting public and private spending, the fiscal package should provide a boost to demand and production over the next two years, as well as mitigate the overall loss of employment and income that would otherwise occur," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beverly Hills, Calif. -- Hispanic immigrants who work in construction, hotels and other blue-collar jobs have suffered from the brutal economic climate. But immigrant gardeners appear to be weathering the harsh conditions well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gardening isn't like working at a factory, where you depend on one employer," says Manuel Quezada, a 54-year-old veteran gardener, as he and his team put down sod in the front yard of a house here. "If I lose one house, it doesn't hurt that much."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far from Beverly Hills, in the neighborhood of Playa del Rey near Los Angeles International Airport, gardener Gustavo Quintero, 50, says customers are more deliberate about their spending during these down times. But, it isn't a big deal, says the Mexican immigrant. "It's mainly the extras," like seasonal flowers and pricey plants, "that people are doing without."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Latino immigrant gardeners and their pick-up trucks have become ubiquitous in neighborhoods of Los Angeles, Atlanta, San Antonio and other cities, where homeowners pay them anywhere from $100 to $1,000 a month to maintain lawns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veteran immigrant gardeners collect dozens of houses over the years to make up a "ruta," or route, that they call their own. Route owners become mini-entrepreneurs who invest in their own equipment, boast a high degree of independence and manage at least one employee. Routes are bought and sold, typically for two to three times what they generate in monthly earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've been offered a lot of money for my route but I won't sell," says Manuel Mora, a gardener in San Antonio who has 40 houses on his route and charges $40 to $80 per visit. The only thing hampering his job these days is a drought, he says. Even amid a foundering economy, "no house has let me go," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A stream of recent data has indicated that both skilled and unskilled immigrants from Latin America and elsewhere are homeward-bound due to the U.S. economy. But gardeners, who generally have a firmer footing, aren't giving up. Despite little schooling, many of them have achieved financial success, providing a secure place in the U.S. middle class for their families and college education for their children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The gardeners look like exploited workers, who lug heavy equipment to do hard, manual labor," says Hernan Ramirez, a researcher at the University of Southern California, who co-wrote a study last month about them with Prof. Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo. "But gardening has put many of their families on the path to upward mobility."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jesse Mejia, who received an M.B.A. from Georgetown University, attests to that. The son of a Salvadoran gardener for whom he would translate prices for clients as a child, Mr. Mejia attended Phillips Exeter Academy, a New Hampshire preparatory school, and Syracuse University, both on scholarships. His sister, Melissa, graduated from the exclusive all-girls Marlborough School in Los Angeles and went to Simmons College with scholarship assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our family achieved the American dream thanks to my father's hard work in gardening," says Mr. Mejia, 33, who works in risk management in the auto industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For immigrants, gardening has long been a stepping stone to prosperity. Japanese immigrants with a background in agriculture pioneered residential gardening in California in the early 20th century. The physical labor didn't require education or fluent English but it lifted them into the middle class. In the mid-1960s, Mexican peasants began flocking to the U.S. Southwest in large numbers. By the 1980s, they had come to dominate the residential gardening niche, Mr. Ramirez says, and some have thrived financially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last two decades the sector boomed, thanks to an influx of Hispanic immigrants coupled with a trend among U.S. homeowners to increasingly outsource lawn care. U.S. consumer spending on gardening and landscaping services jumped to $45 billion in 2006 from $25 billion in 2001, according to the National Gardening Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though many gardeners file income taxes each year, informality characterizes much of the job. There is rarely a written contract between homeowner and gardener. They often don't charge interest for delayed payment. They are usually terminated if a house changes hands, or if they are underbid by a competitor. Or homeowners decide, as they often do in economic downturns, that they can't afford them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is especially true in less-affluent neighborhoods where families are restarting their own lawn mowers in an effort to cut costs. The real-estate collapse also has diminished demand for landscaping and gardening services as new housing developments sit unsold. Veteran gardeners, who own routes that average between $60,000 to $100,000 a year in revenue, according to the USC study, have some resiliency. Their fortunes aren't tied to one employer. But for their younger immigrant employees, who earn roughly $20,000, it will be harder than it has in the past to strike out on their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once a fieldworker in Mexico, Mr. Quezada sneaked into the U.S. in the late 1970s in search of a better life, he says. He learned the trade from a fellow migrant who hailed from the same state of Zacatecas, benefiting from an informal apprenticeship that is common in gardener circles. By the early 1980s, he had struck out on his own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working from dawn to dusk six days a week, Mr. Quezada steadily grew his roster of houses, mainly by word of mouth. He bought his first home in 1985, a two-bedroom house in the largely working-class city of Inglewood, for $86,000. Having married a Mexican who became a U.S. citizen American, he was able to obtain U.S. legal residency a few years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the 1990s, Mr. Quezada boasted take-home pay of about $10,000 a month. "You need to have the gardener's wisdom," says Mr. Quezada, donning a striped flannel shirt, jeans and a USC Trojans cap. He picked up flower samples from the nursery to suggest to his customers and offered to do small home repairs, strategies used by many gardeners to boost their income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Quezada, who has a fourth-grade education, enrolled all three children, who were born in Los Angeles, in local Catholic schools, paying the full tuition. On the way to work, "my father would drop me off at school in his silver pickup truck," recalls his second daughter, Lilianna. "Others were being dropped off in Mercedes and Jaguars."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is now a senior at USC, where her father pays about one-third of her tuition. She covers the rest with a scholarship and loans and a job. Mr. Quezada's silver Dodge truck is adorned with a "USC Dad" sticker. His older daughter, Anabel, graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, two years ago. His youngest child, Manny, 13, is in middle school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, Mr. Quezada has 14 houses on his route, paying an average of $700 a month. He says he has lost only one client since the economy began to slide last year. Having bought land in Mexico, he is thinking about retiring in a few years and dividing his time between Guadalajara and Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm getting old for this work. I don't need the responsibility and pressure," he says. "First, you take care of your children; then you take care of yourself."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumers are rapidly becoming thriftier as the current recession deepens, forcing painful readjustments in industries such as manufacturing and construction to lower levels of consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal saving jumped to 5% of disposable income in January, the Commerce Department said Monday, the highest level in nearly 14 years. It was a remarkable shift from the negative saving rates -- when people were spending more money than they earned -- during the height of the housing bubble in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A higher saving rate is a positive sign for the U.S. economy's long-term health, but the shift now to a lower level of consumer spending comes as the nation's businesses need those dollars the most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate reports Monday showed U.S. manufacturing activity contracted in February for the 13th month in a row, while spending on new construction projects -- both residential and nonresidential, such as lodging and offices -- tumbled in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Too many hotels and malls were put up during the most recent expansion," said Patrick Newport, an economist with IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Mass., in a client note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists note that cheap and easy credit in recent years fueled not only the housing boom but also Americans' insatiable spending, which has now come to a screeching halt. This can be seen most clearly in the saving rate, which subtracts personal spending from after-tax income. It went negative in recent years as Americans had the tools, such as credit cards and home-equity loans, to spend more than they earned. But now, tighter lending standards, combined with households' worries about the economy, have prompted a sea change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the saving rate has risen swiftly, consumer spending has sunk, falling at about a 4% annualized rate in the second half of 2008, after nearly a quarter-century of uninterrupted growth. There are glimmers of hope, though, that the declines in consumer spending, the biggest driver of U.S. economic growth, are abating. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending rose in January by a seasonally adjusted 0.4%, or $44.8 billion, the first increase in seven months, as heavy discounts spurred some post-holiday sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal income also rose, but was boosted by cost-of-living wage increases and other special factors, rather than by broad-based gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the fallout from the loss of consumer spending and the recession's toll on businesses continues. Spending on construction was much weaker than expected in January, and the Commerce agency also revised data from previous months to show bigger declines than first reported. Spending on private residential construction slumped at a seasonally adjusted 2.9% annual rate to $291 billion from December, while private nonresidential spending dropped at a 4.3% annual rate, the most in 15 years, to $391 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, manufacturing activity, a key barometer of the U.S. economy, contracted again in February. The Institute for Supply Management said all 18 industries it tracks, from furniture to computers to plastics and chemicals, reported declines last month, while employment in the industries overall fell to a new low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lousy labor-market reading reaffirms other job-market indicators, such as record-high claims for unemployment benefits, suggesting job losses in February could be the highest yet of the current recession, which began in December 2007. The Labor Department will report Friday February job losses and another expected rise in the unemployment rate, currently 7.6%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Tom Lauricella and Annelena Lobb   </div><div>1149 words</div><div>3 March 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled below 7000 for the first time in 12 years as investors around the globe appeared to be giving up hope and girding for a prolonged recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. investors joined a world-wide selloff that began in Asia and rippled through industries from financials to consumer durables to technology. The Dow dropped 4.2% to 6763.29, its lowest close since April 1997. It has lost almost one-quarter of its value this year and more than half since its high in October 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardest hit were shares of already-battered banks. Shares in <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings PLC</span>, Europe's largest bank, dropped nearly 19% after it announced plans to raise capital and pull out of a disastrous foray into U.S. consumer lending. <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. declined 20% and <span class="companylink">General Electric Co</span>. slid 11%. In Asia Tuesday, Tokyo's Nikkei stock index was down 1% in midday trading, and Hong Kong stocks fell 2.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there was plenty of fresh bad news to go round, traders said the latest downdraft broadly reflected a deepening sense of gloom among investors. Gone are the days where the mantra among investors was to "buy the dips," on the belief that when stock prices fall, they're likely to rebound. Instead, the opposite sentiment has taken hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like an unending nightmare," says Kent Engelke, managing director at Capital Securities Management in Glen Allen, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest readings on the U.S. economy offered little reason for hope. On Monday, the government said the personal savings rate jumped to 5% in January -- its highest level in nearly 14 years, and a shift from recent years when households were spending more than they earned. In the past, many have called upon Americans to save more, but right now, weakness in consumer spending is depressing manufacturing and construction. The Institute for Supply Management said Monday that its measure of manufacturers' employment plans fell to its lowest level since monthly records began in 1948.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report Monday, the government said spending on new construction tumbled in January. Of particular concern: a 4.3% annualized drop in private nonresidential spending, such as on hotels and lodging, the largest monthly decline in 15 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy, which shrank at a 6.2% annual rate in the fourth quarter, is likely to shrink at around a 5% pace in the current quarter, economists estimate. The Labor Department is expected to report on Friday that the unemployment rate -- 7.6% in January -- rose again in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As global markets tumbled, the U.S. dollar strengthened against a wide swath of currencies, sending an index that tracks the dollar versus six major currencies to a three-year high. Treasurys also climbed as investors sought lower-risk investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500 stock index came perilously close to closing below 700 for the first time since 1996. It ended the day at 700.82, down 4.7%. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index declined 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's selloff may have been triggered in part by investor Warren Buffett, who told investors in his quarterly letter that the economy would remain "in shambles for 2009." In addition, there was news of another injection of taxpayer money into insurer <span class="companylink">American International Group Inc</span>. -- a stark reminder of the depth of the financial sector's problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relentless decline is pushing investors to the sidelines. The Dow, down 10 of the past 12 trading days, has fallen 7,401.24 points from its peak of 14164.53 in October 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners LLC in New York, says he hears more exhaustion than panic from clients. "People are dejected and concerned," he says. The feeling is, "Why should I step out in front of a train?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bijon Mishra, 60 years old, a financial-services consultant in New York, has 80% of his main retirement account in U.S. Treasurys and bond funds, 5% in cash, and just 15% in stock funds. He had been thinking that with stocks down so much, he would begin shifting back into the market. But now he's changed his mind. "I want to wait for a firm turnaround, and be as safe as possible," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors fled U.S. stock mutual funds during the first three weeks of February, according to estimates from the Investment Company Institute. That's after withdrawing a record $234 billion last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has yet to show signs of reaching a bottom. There has been no panic selling in large volume, which is typically the hallmark of a market nadir, a phenomenon known as "capitulation," traders say. Many analysts and investors are still worried that earnings estimates are too high and that the value of many stocks may still be inflated. That's even after huge declines that have reduced companies' share prices relative to earnings, known as a price-to-earnings ratio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">General Electric</span>, which slashed its dividend Friday, was one of the hardest hit stocks on Monday, falling 11% to $7.60, its lowest close since 1993. Investors, in effect, are saying that GE's profits will be tepid for years to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody wants to buy a market today that they think is going to be down 2 or 3% tomorrow," says Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at brokerage firm <span class="companylink">BTIG LLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dour outlook is rooted in the fundamental challenges facing the global economy. Investors appear to have given up hope for quick fixes. Instead, many now believe that even with aggressive efforts by U.S. and other governments to shore up the financial markets and economy, the problems are so deep that it is likely to be months before there are concrete signs of their effectiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the decline in housing prices shows meaningful signs of ending, market-watchers say, it will be difficult for stock prices to stage any kind of lasting recovery. Problems in the financial system also are impeding a stock-market recovery. The messes that big banks and other financial institutions have gotten themselves into are so complex that untangling them will likely take many months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at <span class="companylink">Raymond James &amp;Associates</span>, says investors are skeptical of anything that even hints of optimism. Mr. Saut, who turned negative on stocks in late 2007, began telling clients late last year to slowly get back into the market. Their response, he says, has been to send him hate mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All investors are focused on is that they've lost a lot of money," he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Tamara Audi </div><div>1170 words</div><div>28 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>US; A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just before Christmas, detectives from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department pried open a crate outside a warehouse to find something they had been chasing for months: an 840-pound Brazilian emerald that had been reported stolen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, if they could just figure out who owns it. So far, at least five people have come forward to say it's theirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It seems like the more we talk to people, the more people claim to have ownership over this thing," said Lt. Thomas Grubb, who heads the sheriff's investigative team on the case. "We haven't determined who's not a suspect, really."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unable to determine who the real owner is, Lt. Grubb decided to keep the emerald locked up while the investigation proceeds. Meanwhile, a Los Angeles civil court is scheduled to hear from different claimants in the case on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lt. Grubb, who had spent the bulk of his 26-year career conducting narcotics investigations, first got onto the case last September. A distraught man named Larry Biegler had called the sheriff's office to say that his giant emerald had been stolen from a Los Angeles-area warehouse where he had been keeping it. It was worth nearly $400 million, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lt. Grubb's detectives began investigating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emerald, they determined, was in the possession of two businessmen named Todd Armstrong and Kit Morrison, whom detectives tracked to a small town called Eagle, in western Idaho. When the detectives arrived in Eagle, Mr. Armstrong was in the process of trying to sell the emerald to a buyer. "We've run into a small snag," Mr. Armstrong says he told his buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Idaho men said the emerald belonged to them. They said in an interview they paid Mr. Biegler $1 million for diamonds he never delivered. Mr. Biegler had put the emerald up as collateral, they say, for the stones. When the diamonds didn't materialize, they picked up the emerald from the warehouse in Los Angeles. They showed investigators a stack of documents they said prove their claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Biegler -- a gem broker and real-estate investor -- disputes that account. He says he kept up his end of the diamond deal, and claims the Idaho men agreed to pay $80 million for the emerald, which he was willing to sell at that price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Idaho men agreed to turn over the emerald to the sheriff's deputies until the matter could be resolved. But the emerald wasn't even in Idaho. Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Morrison had placed it in a secured warehouse in Las Vegas for safekeeping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lt. Grubb began to organize an excursion to Las Vegas. On the morning detectives drove to get the emerald, he told his deputies: "We're going to stop on the way and get breakfast. We're going to pick up a $400 million piece of evidence. On the way back, we're not stopping."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Lt. Grubb finally laid eyes on the emerald, he said, "It almost didn't look real."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who have seen the emerald describe it as a black boulder with protruding arm-sized green crystal cylinders. Gem experts say unbroken crystals of that size are rare. Such a large specimen usually would not be broken down into smaller pieces for jewelry. It would more likely be sold intact to a private collector or a museum. An appraisal done in Brazil valued it at $372 million, according to documents filed with the Los Angeles court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, George Harlow, curator of minerals and gems for the American Museum of Natural History in New York, says that the most impressive mineral specimens might bring a price of up to six or seven figures. "But nine figures? I'm unaware of any mineral specimen that's ever gone for that much money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the Bahia emerald hasn't sold for a fortune. But it definitely has been around. The emerald was first dug up from a mine in 2001 in Bahia, in eastern Brazil. Bahia emeralds are among the oldest on Earth, formed two billion years ago, according to the Gemological Institute of America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emerald's first owners were a Brazilian gem trader, who owned the rights to the mine, and his business partner. In 2005, they shipped the emerald to a business associate in San Jose, Calif., named Ken Conetto, according to claims made in court documents filed by Mr. Conetto. Mr. Conetto says he kept the emerald stored in San Jose while attempting to find a buyer. He did not pay for the emerald, but he agreed to share some of the profits with the Brazilians, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From San Jose, Mr. Conetto sent the gem to New Orleans, where he thought he had a buyer lined up. When Hurricane Katrina hit, it flooded the warehouse where the emerald was being kept, Mr. Conetto says. The emerald was submerged for weeks, and the sale was never concluded. The emerald returned to San Jose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Conetto enlisted Mr. Biegler to help him sell the emerald.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They thought they could find potential buyers in Los Angeles. So last June, they loaded the rock into a van and drove it down themselves, Mr. Conetto said. Halfway through the trip, the van broke down, leaving the two men and their emerald stranded somewhere on Interstate 5. They rolled into a motel. Mr. Conetto said they paid the motel's owner and her boyfriend to help load the emerald into another van.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, it made it to Los Angeles County, where it sat in a warehouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But things began to sour between Mr. Biegler and Mr. Conetto, according to both men. Mr. Biegler says he took possession of the stone after Mr. Conetto pledged it as collateral on a loan he failed to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Conetto says he never actually borrowed the money and that the emerald is still his.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not uncommon for gems to be used as financing tools for business deals, passed back and forth on paper among brokers while never leaving a vault. That can lead to multiple parties using a jumble of documents to claim rights to the same gem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, new claims continue to emerge. Anthony Thomas a gem trader from outside San Jose, says he is the rightful owner of the emerald because he purchased it for $60,000 from the Brazilians in 2001. Mr. Thomas has also filed a claim in Los Angeles superior court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the court will begin hearing the competing claims of ownership. The emerald, however, remains locked up in the sheriff's custody.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm going to write a nonfiction book on this," Mr. Armstrong says. "But I'm going to have to sell it in the fiction section because nobody will believe it's true."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Signs get worse in U.S. --- Unemployment, durable-goods figures show further weakness</span>
</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>565 words</div><div>27 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. orders for big-ticket items from heaters to computers plunged in January, as consumers and businesses slashed spending. Separate U.S. reports showed new-home sales fell and unemployment-insurance rolls struck a quarter-century high, all dismal signals that pointed to an economy that has fallen even deeper into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A broad spectrum of economic reports showed declines, as business investment plunged, consumers cut back and manufacturers shut factories and cut employees. Each week in February, more than 600,000 people filed new claims for unemployment insurance. Housing starts and consumer confidence hit new lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a deteriorating economy, and that's going to go on for a while," said Kurt Karl, chief U.S. economist for <span class="companylink">Swiss Re</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods -- broadly defined as goods designed to last three years or more, such as cars and appliances -- were down 5.2% in January from a month earlier, the sixth consecutive monthly decline, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. The decline in December orders was revised to 4.6% instead of the 3% decline previously reported. As demand continues to fall in the U.S. and elsewhere, companies are reducing inventories and manufacturers are cutting back production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in orders touched almost every category, including appliances, computer products, metals, cars and car parts. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as an indicator for companies' demand for capital equipment like cranes or computers, fell 5.4% during January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as companies have slowed orders and worked down inventories, they have struggled to get ahead of falling consumer demand. Companies reduced durable-goods inventory by 0.8% in January, the first decline in this cycle, but shipments fell further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revised decline in durable-goods orders for December is the latest in a string of indicators, including exports and consumer pending, that suggest 2008 ended bleaker that previously reported. Friday's report on fourth-quarter gross domestic product is likely to show that in the last three months of 2008 the U.S. economy contracted more than the 3.8% annualized drop previously reported. More worrying, the continued erosion of the economy through January and February suggests it is contracting even more in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With sales and orders declining, companies have continued to slash payrolls, putting added stress on the already overburdened unemployment system. A separate report Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment insurance rose to 667,000 last week, according to the Labor Department. New jobs are harder to find: More than five million people collected unemployment insurance in the week ended Feb. 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More bad news came from the housing sector, where the recession has its origins. New-home sales fell 10.2% in January, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 309,000. That would be the lowest since at least 1963, when the data started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of unsold new homes fell, but a key measure of inventory -- new homes divided by the sales pace -- increased. The amount of time new homes are staying on the market rose to 9.3 months, the longest since August 1982 when, like now, the economy was mired in recession.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">When 'Rescue' Means Eviction</span>
</div><div class="author">By Philip Shishkin </div><div>1366 words</div><div>26 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; D1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, Daphne Webb, a 73-year-old mother of nine, had a heart attack, quit her cleaning job and was soon struggling with medical bills. She and her husband fell behind on the mortgage payments on their white clapboard house in Montclair, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everything came down all at once," says her husband, William, whose $45,000-a-year income as a bus driver wasn't enough to keep the family financially afloat. By 2006, the Webbs were facing foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when two real-estate investors offered to purchase their house, rent it to them and then help them buy it back -- using a long-established practice known as a sale-leaseback -- the Webbs say they jumped at the opportunity. In doing so, the elderly couple waded into the murky world of "foreclosure rescue," a business that targets the growing numbers of distressed homeowners seeking help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, according to recent warnings by authorities, homeowners can dig themselves into an even deeper hole by dealing with purported rescuers, while doing little to ward off eviction. Instead of saving homes, federal officials have warned, distressed homeowners can sometimes lose them -- along with any savings they had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are desperate and willing to consider things they were never willing to consider before," says Bradley Elbein, national coordinator of the Federal Trade Commission's Foreclosure Rescue Fraud Project. "It is a real problem." Many rescuers use sale-leaseback arrangements, while others charge homeowners a one-time fee to help them negotiate with creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sale-leasebacks are a common and legal practice in real estate. To raise cash for short-term needs or to secure tax benefits, a company can sell a building it owns, and then pay rent to the buyer to stay in it. The strategy was particularly attractive before the economic crisis, when credit was easy to obtain and investors believed real-estate prices would keep climbing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some leaseback agreements allow sellers the option to repurchase the property at a later date. In residential real estate, a sale-leaseback can allow homeowners in financial trouble to remain in their homes and pay off their debts. But investigators say the strategy is susceptible to fraud when investors don't give homeowners the promised money. Some investors pocket the mortgages they obtain from banks or strip equity from the homes they buy instead of helping former owners get back on their feet, investigators say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charges of Fraud</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Webbs allege in a civil lawsuit filed in New Jersey Superior Court that they were defrauded into giving up title to their home, and lost $400,000 in home equity and tens of thousands of dollars in fees paid to the two investors, Ronald Losner and Alyssa Azran. The home, now owned by Ms. Azran, is in danger of being foreclosed on, and the Webbs, who have been paying rent to her, could get thrown out by a new owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through an attorney, Mr. Losner and Ms. Azran denied any wrongdoing and said they prevented the Webbs from being evicted when they were in trouble in 2006. The attorney declined to discuss specifics of the Webbs' allegations. The case is currently awaiting trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of cases of alleged sale-leaseback fraud have recently surfaced in Florida and California, affecting hundreds of homeowners in these hard-hit real-estate markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, federal prosecutors in Tampa, Fla., charged Mario Quiroz and Jose Oliveri with wire fraud and money laundering, stemming from sale-leasebacks to 290 homeowners facing foreclosure. Most of the homeowners ended up being evicted and lost any equity they held, investigators say. Messrs. Quiroz and Oliveri, who are accused of defrauding banks of $33 million in the alleged scheme, are believed to have fled to Peru, the Treasury Department says. An attorney for Mr. Oliveri says his client denies wrongdoing. An attorney for Mr. Quiroz couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Feb. 2, a grand jury in San Diego indicted William Hutchings and nine others on charges of allegedly defrauding some 400 homeowners. According to the indictment, the homeowners, mostly Hispanic, were told their properties could be protected because they were part of a land grant Mexico made to the U.S. in the 1850s, and that somehow made them immune from foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consultants falsely claimed the homeowners could take advantage of the immunity by turning over their property deeds to trusts controlled by the consultants that were connected to the grant, the indictment states. Most of the homeowners who turned over their deeds and paid fees to the consultants were later evicted, prosecutors say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory Turner, an attorney for Mr. Hutchings, says his client was going to help the property owners save their homes, but that prosecutors intervened. "There was never an opportunity to demonstrate the veracity of this program," Mr. Turner says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure Proceedings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Webbs' lawsuit, Mr. Losner and Ms. Azram approached them after the couple had sought and failed to obtain federal bankruptcy protection, and the bank that held their mortgage began foreclosure proceedings. They offered the sale-leaseback arrangement for the house, which Mrs. Webb had owned since 1983, says the lawsuit. In a posting on Foreclosures.com, a Web site geared toward real-estate investors, Mr. Losner and Ms. Azran describe efforts by people to save their homes via bankruptcy filings and advise tapping into "this distressed source of people" by approaching them with an offer after they fail to get bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Webbs sold their home to Ms. Azran for $820,000 in March 2006, but received no money in the sale, according to the lawsuit. They also signed a $2,600-a-month lease agreement that stated they could buy the house back if they paid a $45,000 option price after 18 months of paying rent, the lawsuit states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Webb says he and his wife didn't fully understand what they were signing. Tom Farinella, an attorney who represents Mr. Losner and Ms. Azran, says the Webbs were told to consult an attorney about the paperwork, but they didn't. "For the Webbs to now claim they are victims of some large-scale scheme begs to differ with the fact that they were adequately advised to retain counsel," says Mr. Farinella.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He declined to make his clients available for comment. New York State court records show that Mr. Losner, a former attorney, was disbarred in 1995 for allegedly unethical conduct in representing clients in real-estate transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Webbs' lawsuit, Ms. Azran obtained a $533,000 mortgage from <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> through a mortgage broker in Brooklyn, N.Y. The lawsuit alleges <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, which is named as a defendant, approved the mortgage even though Ms. Azran didn't list a job on her application and stated her liquid assets totaled just $100. She also listed 11 other heavily mortgaged rental properties, the lawsuit states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> said "we are investigating the matter." He confirmed that some of the loans it sourced through the Brooklyn broker -- "less than 20%" -- required only a Social Security number, a good credit score and an appraised value of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After obtaining the mortgage, Ms. Azran paid off the Webbs' delinquent mortgage, on which they owed about $400,000. Between April 2006 and June 2008, the Webbs paid about $36,000 in rent to Ms. Azran and Mr. Losner, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Webbs say they made several inquiries about buying their house back for $45,000 in 2007 and 2008. Their lawsuit says Mr. Losner sent appraisers to the house, which cost them at least $700. He also told them at some point they would need to pay $120,000 to buy their house back, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Ms. Azran fell behind in her mortgage payments and in December 2007, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, which serviced the mortgage, filed for foreclosure on the house. A New Jersey Superior Court judge has effectively stayed the foreclosure, and the Webbs remain in the house and are paying their rent to an escrow account.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes tumbled to a nearly 12-year low in January amid another steep drop in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales fell 5.3% to an annual rate of 4.49 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday, noting that buyers were restrained by negotiations in Washington over President Barack Obama's economic-aid package. The plan, as signed last week by Mr. Obama, includes an $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given so much stimulus-package discussion in January, some would-be buyers simply sat out for clarity and certainty on the nature of the housing stimulus," NAR economist Lawrence Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts had been expecting sales to inch upward, which might have signaled that housing prices had seen their bottom -- and thus were poised to recover. Instead, the median home price dropped 14.8% in January to $170,300 from the year-earlier level. The year-over-year drop in December was 15.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A sustained recovery in the housing market is unlikely until home prices stabilize," Insight Economics analyst Steven Wood said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bloated supply of unsold homes is contributing to sharp price drops. Inventories of previously owned homes fell 2.7% at the end of January to 3.6 million available for sale. That represented a 9.6-month supply at the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unfortunately, it's still so high, at just under 10 months, that it guarantees further price falls," said Ian Shepherdson, an analyst at High Frequency Economics. Economists say a normal supply level is about five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 45% of total existing-home sales involve sales of distressed property, including foreclosures, further undercutting prices and squeezing new homes out of the market.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>911 words</div><div>25 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relative cost of owning versus renting is swinging back in favor of homeownership in some U.S. markets, buoyed by several quarters of sharp declines in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of the housing boom, as home prices surged, demand for rentals started to rise as the gap between owning and renting widened significantly. Even after the housing market soured, apartment demand grew as former homeowners became renters, allowing landlords to push healthy rent increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, after two years of rapid home-price depreciation, the relationship between the cost of rental payments versus after-tax mortgage payments is tilting toward ownership in a number of metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past 18 years, after-tax mortgage payments have averaged 26% more than rent payments, according to Green Street Advisors, a real-estate consultancy based in Newport Beach, Calif. In 2006, at the height of the housing bubble, mortgage payments reached as high as 66% more than rent payments. But by the end of 2008, average monthly rent for the largest 50 metropolitan areas was $1,045, compared with after-tax mortgage payments of $1,300, assuming a rate of 5.5% on a 30-year fixed mortgage. That means mortgage payments averaged just 24% more than rent payments, the narrowest gap since 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In more than half of the top 50 U.S. housing markets -- including Los Angeles, northern Virginia and Las Vegas -- the ratio is now below its 18-year average. In Los Angeles, for example, mortgage payments averaged 60% more than rent payments between 1990 and 2008. Now, those payments average 30% more than rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not saying on an absolute basis that it's cheaper to own a home, but on a relative basis . . . owning is looking much more attractive than it has in a long time," said Andrew McCulloch, a Green Street analyst. While the shift doesn't mean that renters will rush to buy homes soon, "it's not a 'no-brainer' anymore if they're going to rent versus own," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If mortgage rates fall to 4.5% -- and some economists have called for the government to push rates to that level to ease the housing crisis -- mortgage payments would average 14% more than rent payments, a level last reached in 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While lower rates could further boost home affordability, that may not be enough to overcome a psychological barrier for many would-be buyers who believe homes will become even more affordable. "One of the challenges in the housing market is not only affordability but also willingness to buy," said Nicolas Retsinas, the director of Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. "People are still worried about falling prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And lending standards are much tighter than they were during the housing boom, when less-creditworthy tenants left apartments in droves to take advantage of no-money-down financing. At the housing market's peak, nearly one in four renters left to buy homes, said Richard Campo, chief executive of Houston-based <span class="companylink">Camden Property Trust</span>. That rate fell to near its historical norm of around 12% by the end of 2008. "The nonqualified renters are not moving out this time," said Mr. Campo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report by <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com also finds that home prices relative to rents are more in line with their historical relationship. Using data that measure average home prices and rent payments for 54 metro areas between 1984 and 2004, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com estimated that eight markets are "undervalued." In those eight markets, home prices relative to rents are below or within 5% of their historical levels. "The bottom is coming into view," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, "But we've still got a ways to go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report notes that home prices relative to rents remain well above historical levels in 30 markets, including Philadelphia; Portland, Ore.; and Virginia Beach, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower prices and interest rates are spurring some buyers to get off the sidelines. Jason Schanta, 37, an independent contractor, has been ready to buy for three years, but he said he waited because Southern California home prices had become "outrageous."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not an economic guru but I knew the bubble was going to burst," he said. He is ready to buy a $500,000 home if <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>.'s <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span> unit approves a short sale on the property in San Juan Capistrano, Calif. (In a short sale, the lender agrees to sell a home for less than the value of the mortgage.) Mr. Schanta currently rents a three-bedroom house for $2,250 a month, and says that he will pay just $150 more in mortgage payments and taxes for a house that has an additional bedroom and 350 more square feet. "Renting now costs just as much as buying," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are finding that they could pay less on their mortgage than they would on rent. Carla Zeineh, 22, and her husband recently began shopping for a home in Irvine, Calif., and discovered that with a 5% mortgage rate, her monthly payment on a $350,000 two-bedroom home with 20% down could be less than the $1,800 month that they pay in rent on their two-bedroom condo.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Overhang</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Housing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hangs Around</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is still crucial to the recovery of other markets, yet it still hasn't found a bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresh evidence is being hauled out by the unpleasant truckload this week. Wednesday brings home-resale data from the National Association of Realtors, and the Commerce Department on Thursday reports new-home sales. Economists estimate that both measures fell modestly in January, following a December in which foreclosures boosted existing-home sales but crushed new-home demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimists have shreds of hope that a turn is near. Prices are off 27% from their 2006 peak, according to <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller data released on Tuesday. And the massive overhang of housing inventory is eroding: Construction has nearly ground to a halt, and the supply of existing homes tumbled in December to 9.3 months from 11.2 months in November, the biggest decline since the NAR started keeping track in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the inventory figures aren't seasonally adjusted, and they will rebound this spring if sellers tiptoe back into the market. Speculators have done much of the distressed buying lately and aren't loath to dump houses back on the market if they have to cut losses. Supply is still nearly twice its "normal" level of about five months, last seen in March 2006. That level probably won't return until at least 2011, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> economist Michelle Meyer estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As long as we have this overhang, particularly in this environment with so many distressed homes, prices are likely to fall," Ms. Meyer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices still are too high compared to rent and income and seem well on track for at least a 40% peak-to-trough decline. That would generate still more losses for banks, threatening fresh turmoil for markets and the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's hoping the government uses realistic housing scenarios when it stress-tests banks, starting on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Pet-Food Recession</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heads for Del Monte</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is <span class="companylink">Del Monte Foods</span> going to the dogs . . . and cats?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long associated with people food, Del Monte owes pet food from 9Lives to Milk-Bone for churning out roughly two-thirds of its operating profit. Some analysts worry that financially strapped pet owners might be abandoning animals to shelters. Other people are opting not to get a pet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pet food has become so important to the company's profit that other parts of Del Monte "could have a banner year and it wouldn't matter," says <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> analyst Eric Katzman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from market-research firm <span class="companylink">Information Resources Inc</span>. shows that in most categories, Del Monte's pet-food sales volume is slowing faster than the overall category, meaning shrinking market share. The data capture only a portion of Del Monte's volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partly behind this trend are price increases imposed to offset rising commodity costs in recent years. Overall, Del Monte is expected to report fiscal third-quarter earnings of 22 cents, two cents lighter than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for people food, IRI data suggest shrinking market share there, too, as consumers trade down to cheaper brands and private-label offerings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[What's Brewing in the Real-Estate Market]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's 1992 Again</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How bad have commercial-property loans gotten? Think 1992.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve reported that banks have placed 2.04% of the value of commercial-real-estate loans in "charge-off" in the fourth quarter of 2008 on a seasonally adjusted basis. The last time the figure got above 2% was the last quarter of 1992. The commercial charge-off rate now exceeds that of residential loans, which was 1.58% in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last quarter's commercial rate was up from 1.16% in the third quarter and just 0.35% in the last quarter of 2007. Charge-offs, according to the Fed, are the value of loans removed from bank's books and charged against loss reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's records on commercial-real-estate charge-offs go back to 1991. The peak was the fourth quarter of 1991 at 2.57%. It didn't get below 1% of loans until 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Switching Teams</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large mixed-used project on the Stamford, Conn., waterfront called Harbor Point has a new developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenwich-based Antares Investment Partners, the flashy builder of speculative mansions and owner of high-priced office space, has brought in the Norwalk-based Building &amp;Land Technology to run the development. The switch was made because BLT has more experience in commercial construction than Antares, says Dean Adler, co-founder of real-estate investment firm Lubert-Adler, which has a large equity stake in the project. "It's not a negative reflection on Antares," explains Mr. Adler. Antares had assembled the land for the ambitious project and retains an equity stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the financial crisis buffeting greater New York, the development partners are going ahead with plans to build an office building, about 300 rental apartments and a grocery store. For now, Mr. Adler says the team is funding the project with equity while it attempts to arrange construction loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado's Ill Winds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> shares have taken a beating recently compared with peers, and things got a little worse when it reported a hefty set of charges against its earnings Tuesday. Adjusting for charges, its FFO, or funds from operations, a common performance measure among real-estate investment trusts, decreased 8.8% from a year earlier to $1.14 a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an unadjusted basis Vornado posted an FFO loss of $77 million or 50 cents a share compared with a positive $193 million or $1.18 a share FFO in the year-earlier period. On a day when REIT stocks rallied 9%, according to SNL Financial, Vornado rose just 3.5%, or $1.28, to $37.77 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado's cash-filled balance sheet and relatively few debt needs had made it a diamond in the rough among REIT investors. But lately, worries about its speculative investments have spooked investors. Vornado took a $100 million noncash charge on its shares in <span class="companylink">Lexington Realty Trust</span>, an office REIT, and another $117 million on new developments.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>754 words</div><div>25 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; C8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While transactions have slumped in most corners of the real-estate world, the recent sale of a New Jersey office complex for $230 million highlights the unusual position of a suburban Chicago-based company that is still ready and able to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inland American Real Estate Trust Inc., a so-called nontraded real-estate investment trust sponsored by one of the Oak Brook, Ill.-based <span class="companylink">Inland Real Estate Group</span> of Cos., last month paid $40 million in cash and assumed a $190 million mortgage to acquire a three-building office complex in Bridgewater, N.J., from <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty Corp</span>., a New York-based office REIT, and property financing specialists <span class="companylink">Gramercy Capital Corp</span>. The approximately 670,000-square-foot office property is the North American headquarters of <span class="companylink">Sanofi-Aventis SA</span>, a France-based pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale is one of the highest prices paid in the U.S. this year for an office property, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York-based real-estate-research firm. It also is part of a string of acquisitions valued at a total of about $700 million that Inland American has agreed to or completed so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inland American's acquisitions are fueled by more than $7 billion that it has raised since 2005 from investors, largely individuals, who have bought the shares that aren't traded on a public exchange. That inflow has slowed somewhat but has continued even as Inland has faced pressure from some investors seeking to sell back their shares. Inland American raised about $91 million last month, according to Robert A. Stanger &amp;Co., a Shrewsbury, N.J., investment-banking firm that specializes in nontraded REITS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many nontraded REITS are still flush with cash," says said Paul Adornato, a senior REIT analyst with BMO Capital Markets in New York. "That's not to say the value of their property isn't going down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SL Green, which like many publicly traded REITS is struggling to increase its liquidity, recognized a sizable gain in the deal, accordingly to Isaac Zion, managing director of SL Green. In 2005 SL Green and a predecessor partner to Gramercy paid about $125 million for the property that was being vacated by <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">G. Joseph Cosenza, a former fourth-grade teacher and Chicago-area native, and three other former teachers founded the <span class="companylink">Inland Real Estate Group</span> of Cos. more than 40 years ago. The group, through its various affiliates, owns more than 105 million square feet of commercial real estate that it values at about $26 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cosenza, who is also president of Inland Real Estate Acquisitions Inc., said the <span class="companylink">Sanofi-Aventis</span> property is a good example of the type of properties Inland looks to buy. He prefers occupied properties in well-populated areas. "I'm so glad people are hesitant and sitting on the sidelines because it opens up a field for me of deals that I might have never seen before," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nontraded REITS have been controversial. They have been criticized by some analysts partly because they are sold through brokers who charge higher commissions than would be paid buying public REITS. This depresses total return, notes Mike Kirby, director of research for Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nontraded REITs also are less liquid. Inland will buy shares back from investors after they have held them for at least a year. But Inland also reserves the right to suspend redemptions if investors try to sell back more than 5% of all shares in a 12-month period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall Inland Western Retail Real Estate Trust Inc., another nontraded REIT sponsored by a member of the <span class="companylink">Inland Real Estate Group</span> of Cos., suspended its program to buy back shares after that same 5% limit was reached. Martel Day, executive vice president of the Inland securities arm that raises the capital, acknowledges that Inland American also could reach that point because an increased number of investors are interested in selling back their shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, Inland American's shares appear to be performing better than public REITs. An investor who paid $10 for a share in Inland American one year ago could sell it back for $9.25, a mere 7.5% drop, according to company executives. By comparison, the Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index, which doesn't include dividend returns, is down 58% for the past 12 months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is still crucial to the recovery of other markets, yet it still hasn't found a bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresh evidence is being hauled out by the unpleasant truckload this week. Wednesday brings home-resale data from the National Association of Realtors, and the Commerce Department on Thursday reports new-home sales. Economists estimate that both measures fell modestly in January, following a December in which foreclosures boosted existing-home sales but crushed new-home demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimists have shreds of hope that a turn is near. Prices are off 27% from their 2006 peak, according to <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller data released on Tuesday. And the massive overhang of housing inventory is eroding: Construction has nearly ground to a halt, and the supply of existing homes tumbled in December to 9.3 months from 11.2 months in November, the biggest decline since the NAR started keeping track in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the inventory figures aren't seasonally adjusted, and they will rebound this spring if sellers tiptoe back into the market. Speculators have done much of the distressed buying lately and aren't loath to dump houses back on the market if they have to cut losses. Supply is still nearly twice its "normal" level of about five months, last seen in March 2006. That level probably won't return until at least 2011, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> economist Michelle Meyer estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As long as we have this overhang, particularly in this environment with so many distressed homes, prices are likely to fall," Ms. Meyer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices still are too high compared to rent and income and seem well on track for at least a 40% peak-to-trough decline. That would generate still more losses for banks, threatening fresh turmoil for markets and the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's hoping the government uses realistic housing scenarios when it stress-tests banks, starting on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Pet-Food Recession Heads for Del Monte</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is <span class="companylink">Del Monte Foods</span> going to the dogs ... and cats?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long associated with people food, Del Monte owes pet food from 9Lives to Milk-Bone for churning out roughly two-thirds of its operating profit. Some analysts worry that financially strapped pet owners might be abandoning animals to shelters. Other people are opting not to get a pet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pet food has become so important to the company's profit that other parts of Del Monte "could have a banner year and it wouldn't matter," says <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> analyst Eric Katzman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from market-research firm <span class="companylink">Information Resources Inc</span>. shows that in most categories, Del Monte's pet-food sales volume is slowing faster than the overall category, meaning shrinking market share. The data capture only a portion of Del Monte's volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partly behind this trend are price increases imposed to offset rising commodity costs in recent years. Overall, Del Monte is expected to report fiscal third-quarter earnings of 22 cents, two cents lighter than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for people food, IRI data suggest shrinking market share there, too, as consumers trade down to cheaper brands and private-label offerings.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>912 words</div><div>25 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relative cost of owning versus renting is swinging back in favor of homeownership in some U.S. markets, buoyed by several quarters of sharp declines in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of the housing boom, as home prices surged, demand for rentals started to rise as the gap between owning and renting widened significantly. Even after the housing market soured, apartment demand grew as former homeowners became renters, allowing landlords to push healthy rent increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, after two years of rapid home-price depreciation, the relationship between the cost of rental payments versus after-tax mortgage payments is tilting toward ownership in a number of metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past 18 years, after-tax mortgage payments have averaged 26% more than rent payments, according to Green Street Advisors, a real-estate consultancy based in Newport Beach, Calif. In 2006, at the height of the housing bubble, mortgage payments reached as high as 66% more than rent payments. But by the end of 2008, average monthly rent for the largest 50 metropolitan areas was $1,045, compared with after-tax mortgage payments of $1,300, assuming a rate of 5.5% on a 30-year fixed mortgage. That means mortgage payments averaged just 24% more than rent payments, the narrowest gap since 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In more than half of the top 50 U.S. housing markets -- including Los Angeles, northern Virginia and Las Vegas -- the ratio is now below its 18-year average. In Los Angeles, for example, mortgage payments averaged 60% more than rent payments between 1990 and 2008. Now, those payments average 30% more than rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not saying on an absolute basis that it's cheaper to own a home, but on a relative basis...owning is looking much more attractive than it has in a long time," said Andrew McCulloch, a Green Street analyst. While the shift doesn't mean that renters will rush to buy homes soon, "it's not a 'no-brainer' anymore if they're going to rent versus own," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If mortgage rates fall to 4.5% -- and some economists have called for the government to push rates to that level to ease the housing crisis -- mortgage payments would average 14% more than rent payments, a level last reached in 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While lower rates could further boost home affordability, that may not be enough to overcome a psychological barrier for many would-be buyers who believe homes will become even more affordable. "One of the challenges in the housing market is not only affordability but also willingness to buy," said Nicolas Retsinas, the director of Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. "People are still worried about falling prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And lending standards are much tighter than they were during the housing boom, when less-creditworthy tenants left apartments in droves to take advantage of no-money-down financing. At the housing market's peak, nearly one in four renters left to buy homes, said Richard Campo, chief executive of Houston-based <span class="companylink">Camden Property Trust</span>. That rate fell to near its historical norm of around 12% by the end of 2008. "The nonqualified renters are not moving out this time," said Mr. Campo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report by <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com also finds that home prices relative to rents are more in line with their historical relationship. Using data that measure average home prices and rent payments for 54 metro areas between 1984 and 2004, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com estimated that eight markets are "undervalued." In those eight markets, home prices relative to rents are below or within 5% of their historical levels. "The bottom is coming into view," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, "But we've still got a ways to go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report notes that home prices relative to rents remain well above historical levels in 30 markets, including Philadelphia; Portland, Ore.; and Virginia Beach, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower prices and interest rates are spurring some buyers to get off the sidelines. Jason Schanta, 37, an independent contractor, has been ready to buy for three years, but he said he waited because Southern California home prices had become "outrageous."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not an economic guru but I knew the bubble was going to burst," he said. He is ready to buy a $500,000 home if <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>.'s <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span> unit approves a short sale on the property in San Juan Capistrano, Calif. (In a short sale, the lender agrees to sell a home for less than the value of the mortgage.) Mr. Schanta currently rents a three-bedroom house for $2,250 a month, and says that he will pay just $150 more in mortgage payments and taxes for a house that has an additional bedroom and 350 more square feet. "Renting now costs just as much as buying," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are finding that they could pay less on their mortgage than they would on rent. Carla Zeineh, 22, and her husband recently began shopping for a home in Irvine, Calif., and discovered that with a 5% mortgage rate, her monthly payment on a $350,000 two-bedroom home with 20% down could be less than the $1,800 month that they pay in rent on their two-bedroom condo.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>710 words</div><div>25 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling home prices are spurring an increase in all-cash home sales in markets that have been hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis, an indication that bargain hunters have descended on the markets looking for deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes financed with cash comprised one-third of sales in Phoenix last month, up from 19% one year ago, according to a report by <span class="companylink">Raymond James &amp;Associates Inc</span>. In Sacramento, Calif., all-cash sales accounted for 24% of total home sales last month, up from 8% in January 2008 and 3% in January 2007, according to the Sacramento Association of Realtors. Sacramento and Phoenix have each seen home prices fall by one-third in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash sales are up even more in many Florida markets. In Miami, cash offers accounted for 30% of sales last month, according to a report by Thomas Lawler, a housing economist based in Leesburg, Va. That share more than doubled in Gulf Coast communities such as Punta Gorda and Englewood, Fla., where cash financing accounted for 65% and 60% of sales, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's sort of like, 'Good Lord, prices have fallen so low that even people who are willing to pay all cash are buying,'" says Mr. Lawler, adding that cash financing has increased sharply in every major market "where distressed sales have soared and prices have plunged," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash sales are typically higher in Florida than in other markets, in part because the state attracts lots of foreign buyers and retirees who are more likely to plunk down their savings without taking out a mortgage. But a number of cash buyers these days, in Florida and elsewhere, are also investors scooping up distressed properties and affluent families seeking relatively inexpensive vacation homes. "Cash investors have come right out and said, 'We can't make a return on our money in stocks or bonds,'" says Heather Barr, a Realtor based in Gilbert, Ariz., a Phoenix suburb. "They think Phoenix has had such sharp price declines that we've got to be near the bottom and real estate will be a safe place to put their money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, cash buyers are finding that they can get a deeper discount by making an all-cash offer. In markets with a glut of foreclosed homes, lenders are becoming more aggressive to sell "simply because there aren't enough first-time home buyers around to sop up the excess supply," Mr. Lawler says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brett Barry, a Phoenix Realtor, is selling a bank-owned home in Cave Creek, Ariz., to an Indianapolis couple that is retiring and buying a second home. The property will sell for about $190,000, down from an earlier listing price of $209,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That price was a good deal, and the bank didn't even counter it," says Mr. Barry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate bank-owned home in the same development sold for $133,000 to a cash investor, beating out a $179,000 offer from a first-time home buyer with financing from the Federal Housing Administration. "The bank just didn't want to take the chance with financing," Mr. Barry says. "The lenders I work with will take a substantially lower cash offer as long as they see proof of liquid funds."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In South Florida's condo market, "the all-cash buyer is basically the only one doing deals today because the financing just doesn't exist," said broker Peter Zalewski of Condo Vultures Realty LLC in Bal Harbour. "It's virtually impossible to get a loan."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A glut of condos that eroded home prices has triggered tighter lending standards, including 50% down payments even for individuals with spotless credit. Meanwhile, beginning in April, government-backed mortgage agency <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> will tack on a delivery fee to mortgages backed by condo units nationwide if the down payment is less than 25%. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> is doing the same, a move that follows last month's tightened condo-lending guidelines, with requirements including a majority of units presold and reserve amounts. In Florida, Fannie must now review each new project for stability before it will guarantee financing.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">After the Boom; In Maricopa, Ariz., a Paradise Found and Lost</span>
</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>1341 words</div><div>24 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maricopa, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders rushed into this one-time agricultural crossroads during the housing boom. They put up beige stucco houses on winding streets, with names like Heavenly Place and Good Vibrations Lane. They lured young people who couldn't afford homes in nearby Phoenix or its costly suburbs. The population soared to 37,000 last year from 1,400 a decade ago, making Maricopa one of the nation's fastest-growing towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, it's become a dead end for some of those people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're trapped," says Tracy Campbell, as she watches her 2-year-old daughter romp on a playground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, her husband, Zachary Campbell, accepted a transfer from San Diego to Phoenix to manage a recreational-vehicle store. For the first time, the Campbells figured, they could afford their own home, though that meant moving to Maricopa, about 20 miles from Mr. Campbell's store. They scraped together a $50,000 down payment to buy a new four-bedroom home in Maricopa, for $250,000. It came with black granite countertops, cherry kitchen cabinets and a pool in back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Ms. Campbell figures, the home is worth perhaps half what they paid in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even that might be optimistic. Along a nearby highway, young men hired by a local real estate brokerage wave red signs touting "Homes From $69.9 K."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Campbells planned to sell their house for a profit after a few years and move back to San Diego before their daughter starts kindergarten. Today, they couldn't hope to sell the house for enough to pay off the mortgage. They fear the down payment they made on the house is money they won't see again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people in the neighborhood are simply walking away from their houses, leaving them for the lenders to foreclose. "We're surrounded by empty houses on three sides," Ms. Campbell says. But she and her husband have kept up on their payments, and want to keep their credit record clean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If misery loves company, the Campbells are in good shape: Zillow.com, a real-estate information provider, estimates that 75% of all homeowners in Maricopa, including those with no mortgage debt, owe more on their mortgages than the current value of their homes. For the nation as a whole, the estimate is 18%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town of Maricopa, which isn't part of the nearby county of the same name, is about 30 miles south of downtown Phoenix and is separated from the city by an Indian reservation that remains mostly desert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Maricopa's fate is closely tied to that of the Phoenix metro area, where billboards tout foreclosure auctions and bankruptcy lawyers. Largely because of a plunge in construction and related fields, employment in the metro area shrank 4.5% last year, steeper than the national drop of about 2%, says Lee McPheters, an economics professor at Arizona State University. One consolation, he says, is that the steep drop in home prices and low property taxes compared with California and Midwestern states eventually could bring in a new wave of residents to revive the local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a symbol of Maricopa's former breakneck growth, a temporary building cobbled together from double-wide mobile homes serves as the city hall, across the street from a trailer park left over from the pre-boom days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Maricopa will do well just to grow its population gradually for a few years. In 2005, consultants hired by the town projected that the population would reach 350,000 by 2020. City officials no longer see that as realistic. The real estate bust "will make for a more sane [pace of] growth," says Mayor Anthony Smith. He points out empty spaces that could be occupied by parks or a community college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak in 2005, Maricopa collected fees on nearly 800 single-family home-building permits a month, creating a big source of revenue. In January, it awarded just 13. Because fee and tax revenue has plunged, the town is delaying equipment purchases and leaving some job openings unfilled. Revenue for the year ending June 30 is expected to be about $31.6 million, down from $45 million a year before. The mayor says Maricopa can cope with the revenue drop because it budgeted conservatively in recent years and avoided debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores Inc</span>. is due to open a store here in May, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> has put plans for a store on hold. Business at the Say Sushi Japanese restaurant is "very, very slow," says Dong Lee, a Korean immigrant who runs the restaurant. A Quiznos sandwich shop recently closed, as did a children's clothing boutique.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving through town in his silver Toyota pickup, Mayor Smith describes the real estate bust as an opportunity. Maricopa's city council can use the lull to improve planning and zoning laws so the town will be ready for its next growth spurt, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest challenges for interrupted boom towns like Maricopa will be to avoid allowing foreclosed homes to turn into eyesores that destroy the appeal of neighborhoods. The town government is holding "neighborhood clean-up days" to pull weeds and pick up litter at vacant homes. The city also is working on a plan for a central business district that would make Maricopa more than a cluster of strip malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the hardest-hit areas is Maricopa Meadows, a cookie-cutter housing development at the southern end of Maricopa. "We got in on the ground floor," Christian Price says ruefully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Price, a financial adviser with an office in Phoenix, and his wife, Cindy, a photographer, liked the small-town feel. They paid about $180,000 for a four-bedroom home in early 2005. By late 2006, Mr. Price figures, the value had rocketed to about $270,000 amid a "frenzy" of speculation. Now, with foreclosure sales dragging down values, he thinks the home would sell for only around $50,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Price, who is president of the Meadows homeowner association, estimates that around one in eight of the 1,600 houses has been foreclosed, and several hundred of them are empty. He says lower-income people who previously couldn't afford new homes now are buying them here for $50,000 to $100,000. It's good that housing has become more affordable, Mr. Price says. Still, he says, "this is going to sound terrible, but it brings in a different caliber of people."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, residents are wondering who will complete projects left unfinished. Steve Velaski, an occupational therapist who moved into a new gated community called Province in 2005, likes his home on Lemon Drop Drive, which is near Jawbreaker Drive and Candyland Place. His wife, Gayle, enjoys the posh fitness center available to residents. But Mr. Velaski is less thrilled by the view from his backyard: a giant mound of dirt left when the community's builder went into bankruptcy. Mr. Velaski and other residents wonder who will acquire the empty land and whether whatever is eventually built there will blend well with their upscale homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smith hopes that by creating more parks and other amenities and attracting more employers to this bedroom community he can make people want to stay here. "We have a very promising future," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rudy Dominguez, who administrates computer networks, will have to think that over. On a recent Saturday morning, he was hanging out in a white T-shirt and beige shorts at a garage sale being held by a neighbor who is moving away. Mr. Dominguez believes his Maricopa house now is worth about half the $213,000 he paid in 2006. He can afford the mortgage, but thinks the lender should reduce his payments. "If they're not going to help me," he says, "they can have it."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>1626 words</div><div>24 February 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; D1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington is trying to ease the mortgage crisis by helping people refinance into home loans with better terms. But one group is being left on the sidelines: borrowers with loans too big to qualify for government backing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama's housing stability plan, announced last week, excludes such borrowers from nearly all of its mortgage-bailout provisions. Instead, it focuses on middle-income consumers who have lower, so-called conforming loans. Such loans top out at $417,000 in most parts of the country, though they can run as high as $729,750 in certain pricier markets, such as parts of California, New York and Hawaii.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anything bigger is called a "jumbo" loan -- and not only is the government ignoring this segment of the market, so are lenders, few of whom are originating or refinancing jumbo mortgages. The reason: Jumbo loans are too large to be guaranteed by a government-backed mortgage agency, such as <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, meaning banks assume the risk if the loan goes bad. In the current lending environment, few banks want to take on any risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's hurting borrowers like Pete Zipkin, who's the kind of affluent customer that banks once coveted. The 35-year-old technology executive -- who says he has a spotless credit record and at least 20% equity in his home -- has come up empty-handed in his search for a jumbo mortgage of more than $1 million for his recently built five-bedroom home in Alamo, Calif., near San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unable to find a fixed-rate mortgage when his construction loan expired last fall, Mr. Zipkin now has a variable-rate loan that adjusts monthly. The rate is currently 5%, but it can go as high as 12%. He says banks have turned him down in part because they are worried about falling home prices in California, even though price declines in Alamo, where the median home price is $1.3 million, have been less severe than in the rest of the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If somebody has the income, the equity and the credit rating," they should qualify for a loan, Mr. Zipkin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Buying Down' a Mortgage</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homeowners in high-priced markets are experiencing similar difficulties, and are left with few options other than to raid their savings or retirement accounts and use the cash to "buy down" their mortgages. In some cases, home buyers need to put up a large down payment, often 25% or more, to qualify for a jumbo mortgage. Others are bypassing jumbos altogether and putting up enough cash to become eligible for a lower-rate conforming loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every single day I'm talking to people who have a jumbo loan, and I can't do anything for them," says Jeff Lazerson, a mortgage broker in Laguna Nigel, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While total mortgage originations fell by 17% in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter, jumbo originations fell by 42% to $11 billion, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. That's the lowest volume ever tracked by the trade publication, which has figures dating to 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">ING Direct</span>, a unit of <span class="companylink">ING Groep NV</span>, is one of the few lenders that is boosting jumbo originations, though it requires a minimum 30% down payment in the most expensive housing markets, up from 20% earlier last year. For condos, ING requires a minimum 45% down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you have been able to ... save for a down payment, that to us speaks volumes about your character," says Bill Higgins, ING's chief lending officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like most jumbo lenders, ING offers mainly "hybrid" adjustable-rate mortgages that carry a fixed-rate for five or seven years and then reset annually to an adjustable rate. ING is offering initial rates as low as 5.5% for a seven-year adjustable-rate jumbo mortgage. Last week, the average for a 30-year conforming mortgage was 5.22%, according to HSH Associates, a financial publisher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher Rates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumbo borrowers have always paid slightly higher rates than conforming-loan borrowers, in part because luxury homes can be harder to sell quickly for their full price if a homeowner defaults. But the gap between jumbo and conforming loans, historically around 0.3 percentage point, is now about 1.55 points, with jumbo rates averaging about 6.77%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some banks, though, are quoting much-higher jumbo rates. Mortgage brokers say that indicates that lenders are reluctant to make jumbo loans and are setting their prices high to deter new deals. For example, <span class="companylink">Taylor, Bean &amp;Whitaker Mortgage Corp</span>. in Ocala, Fla., recently listed a 7% rate on a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo loan, but charges up-front origination fees equal to 5% of the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate professionals say that the lack of financing for high-income consumers is putting extra pressure on affluent communities and causing prices to fall even further. "The million-dollar-and-above market is sinking like a lead weight," Mr. Lazerson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frustrated Buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is frustrating potential buyers like Brandon Steele, a vice president of marketing for a food-products company, who was approved by his credit union for a $990,000 loan last year to buy a home in the Sherman Oaks section of Los Angeles. He had hoped to move his growing family out of the single-family house he has rented for the past four years and into a larger one. Those plans fell through when his credit union told him in December that they were getting out of jumbo lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We thought we were being prudent by not jumping into the housing market when it was overinflated," he says. "It's a catch-22. Now that we want to purchase, we cannot get financing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steele says that he and his wife have high incomes and a solid credit rating, but that the money he had planned on using to make a larger down payment was lost in the stock market. He says his only option now is to wait for home prices to fall another 20% or to save an additional $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Short of moving into a two-bedroom apartment or not funding my 401(k), I can't save that kind of money in a year," he says. "If you live in a high-cost area, there's a whole different standard. Everything's a jumbo loan." Mr. Steele says that for now, he's hoping his credit union, where he's been a customer for 10 years, will reinstate his pre-approved status and fund the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of financing is particularly acute in markets where rising home prices have made jumbo loans a necessity for even middle-class borrowers, such as New York City, coastal California and Washington, D.C. "If you own a $650,000 home in many parts of this country, you're not a wealthy person by any stretch, and you're being cut out of any relief," says Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around 4% of all borrowers have loans that exceed conforming limits, according to an estimate by First American CoreLogic. But that share rises in high-cost states such as California, at 17%, and New York, at 8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some jumbo clients -- enticed by historically low conforming rates -- are willing to dip into their retirement savings to lower their balances. Neil Littman, for one, estimates that he'd save $300 a month if he paid $25,000 to bring his loan down to the $417,000 limit in Erie, Colo., a bedroom community about 30 minutes east of Boulder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now I'm trying to conserve cash, but to get the savings on the interest rate, I'm willing to put more money down," says the 38-year-old, a commercial real-estate broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Littman, who purchased his four-bedroom home in April 2007, laments the fact that the Boulder area doesn't have a higher conforming-loan limit. Median home prices in Boulder are nearly $650,000, though median prices for the county are much lower, at around $360,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raiding the 401(k) Account</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other borrowers are raiding their 401(k) accounts in order to qualify for a cheaper mortgage. Jon Eisen, a San Diego mortgage broker, says that one of his clients -- a dentist with a $1 million jumbo loan -- is considering pulling $450,000 from a retirement savings account to pay down his "interest-only" adjustable rate mortgage, in which principal payments are deferred for a set period. That would allow him to refinance into a fixed-rate conforming loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Randy Kobata, who lives in Santa Monica, Calif., says he's considering taking $70,000 out of his savings to pay down his mortgage in order to get to the conforming limit. He isn't able to refinance his adjustable-rate jumbo loan from <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual Inc</span>., now a unit of <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>., because the value of his two-bedroom home has declined by $100,000 in the past two years. Meanwhile, the 31-year-old, who works in commercial real estate, has asked the bank for a rate reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than dip into savings to get a better rate, some advisers say, clients are better off holding tight. "If your home has lost 15% in two years, why pay down just to refinance?" says Craig Vogt, a mortgage broker in Brooklyn, N.Y. "It's like losing money two times."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration is trying to ensure its $275 billion housing-relief program will help only genuinely needy homeowners, but some critics say that it will also aid those who don't need -- or deserve -- the help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's going to encourage everyone under the sun to try to qualify for this," warns Chris Mayer, senior vice dean at Columbia Business School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other critics balk at the idea of providing help to borrowers who used their houses as cash machines, or who bought much costlier homes than they could afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Administration officials say it is impossible to help large groups of borrowers without introducing some degree of what has come to be known as "moral hazard." In other words, in its effort to help homeowners who behaved responsibly but wound up in trouble, the Obama plan will likely help some who didn't, which some say encourages more risky behavior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The guidelines for loan modifications, part of the overall housing-relief program, are scheduled to be released early next month. Administration officials stress that they are carefully designing them to make sure borrowers can't game the system. For example, investors and homeowners who can afford their mortgage payments won't qualify for help, officials noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement of the administration's program is already producing a flurry of calls to mortgage companies. A <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> spokeswoman said that interest in refinancing had contributed to a 20% increase in call volume at its retail-mortgage call center Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Walsh, a mortgage broker in Scottsdale, Ariz., says his phones have been "ringing off the hook." But he says he is frustrated that the provisions weren't more detailed. "We don't really know what to tell people," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moral hazard has been a key issue in the debate over how the government should respond to financial distress, whether among homeowners or corporate titans. Critics have assailed the bank bailouts for helping businesses whose mistakes contributed to the financial crisis in the first place. And some homeowners who have stayed current on mortgages don't like the idea of helping borrowers who refinanced homes and pulled out cash for vacations, cars and other things, or submitted loan applications that falsified their income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another concern is that borrowers are stopping making payments in order to get help. That's because mortgage companies often won't modify the loans of troubled borrowers until they're delinquent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama plan addresses this issue by making it more likely that borrowers who need help will get a modification before they become seriously delinquent. Under the plan, mortgage companies and investors will receive incentive payments for helping borrowers who are "at risk" of defaulting because of a loss of income or an interest-rate increase, for instance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Achilles' heel" of many previous efforts to stem foreclosures is that they have required borrowers to default in order to get help, says Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Providing aid to borrowers who haven't yet defaulted "is an unrecognized and powerful component of this plan," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan-modification guidelines that will be released next month also will be designed to weed out borrowers who don't need help, administration officials say. For example, they are likely to require that mortgage companies verify borrowers' incomes or claims of financial hardship to make sure they can't afford their payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homeowners who borrowed more than they could afford, either when they bought the house or refinanced, also may not qualify for assistance. That's because mortgage servicers are likely to use a "net present value" test to determine the losses that would result from a modification, and how they would compare with a foreclosure. If the losses are too great, the modification wouldn't be likely to happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some borrowers may slip through the cracks. Someone working two or three jobs to make ends meet, for instance, may decide to give up one job in order to show a lower income. "Five years ago, if you really wanted to buy a house, you would do whatever you could to show every income source to make it as high as possible," says Tom Lawler, an independent housing economist. Now, borrowers seeking help "will want to show a low income." Borrowers with substantial assets but moderate incomes may also be able to get help, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mayer says his "biggest pet peeve" with the Obama plan is that it will pay participating borrowers $1,000 a year for staying current on their mortgages once they are modified. He says, instead, participants should be warned: "If you're not going to make your payments on time, you're going to lose your house, because we just made it affordable."</p>
