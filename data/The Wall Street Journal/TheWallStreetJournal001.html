<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a photo, Lisa Cunningham is standing in front of a friend's house with a newly installed heat pump. A caption in an earlier version of this article incorrectly said it was her own. (Corrected on July 31.) Also, Stephen Mushegan is a manager of the Rocky Mountain Institute's carbon-free buildings program. An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified him as Steven. (Corrected on July 31)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Massachusetts is emerging as a key battleground in the U.S. fight over whether to phase out natural gas[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/cities-try-to-phase-out-gas-stovesbut-cooks-are-pushing-back-11626514200] for home cooking and heating, with fears of unknown costs and unfamiliar technologies fueling much of the opposition to going all-electric.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More towns around Boston are debating measures to block or limit the use of gas in new construction, citing concerns about climate change. The measures have encountered opposition from some home builders, utilities and residents in a state with cold winters, relatively high housing prices and aging pipeline networks in need of pricey repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Massachusetts debate encapsulates the challenges many states face in pursuing aggressive measures[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/battle-brews-over-banning-natural-gas-to-homes-11622334674] to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that may directly impact consumers. The cost of fully electrifying buildings varies widely throughout the country and has ignited debates about who should potentially pay more, or change their habits, in the name of climate progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the resistance to electrifying new homes stems from concerns about having to heat or cook using technologies such as heat pumps and induction stoves[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/why-new-induction-cooktops-are-safer-and-faster-than-gas-or-electric-11619104405]. In New England, most homes are heated with fuel oil or natural gas, and gas or propane is used widely for cooking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve McKenna, a Massachusetts real-estate agent, was hired last year to sell a new, all-electric home in Arlington, a town outside of Boston that is considering gas restrictions. The home initially listed for $1.1 million, but many prospective buyers were uncomfortable with the prospect of facing higher electric bills, Mr. McKenna said. It ultimately sold for about $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Here in Arlington, you put a house on the market and in six minutes there are 60 offers on the property," Mr. McKenna said. "But this one took over two months to sell."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major cities, including San Francisco, Seattle, Denver and New York, have enacted or proposed measures to ban or discourage the use of natural gas in new homes and buildings, two years after Berkeley, Calif., passed the first such prohibition in the U.S. in 2019. The efforts have sparked a backlash, prompting some states to make gas bans illegal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brookline, just outside of Boston, in 2019 became the first town outside of California to attempt to limit gas use in new buildings. But the state attorney general last year blocked the measure's implementation after finding it conflicted with state building codes, and thus needed state legislative approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undeterred, Brookline city leaders enacted a new bylaw in June governing special permits for buildings or renovations. Under the bylaw, permits for all-electric buildings would never expire, while those for buildings with gas hookups would expire by 2030 to encourage disconnections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four other Massachusetts towns are working to enact similar measures, said Lisa Cunningham, an architect who helped craft Brookline's bylaw. All would be subject to review by the state attorney general, who will decide whether they would need legislative approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are realizing that it's now or never," Ms. Cunningham said. "There's really only one way to reduce our emissions, and that is to stop using gas and stop using fossil fuels."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fight comes as Massachusetts and other states across the country set goals to substantially reduce carbon emissions in the coming decades. Massachusetts earlier this year passed a law requiring the state to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 by improving energy efficiency, procuring more electricity from renewable sources and otherwise cutting the use of fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The push to restrict gas use has sown concerns among home builders and real-estate agents that requiring new homes to use electricity for heating and cooking will add to their overall cost when Massachusetts home prices have risen amid supply-chain issues and low inventory. The Warren Group, a real-estate data firm, reported that the median sale price for a single-family home in Massachusetts reached $525,000 in May, up from $425,000 a year earlier. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction costs for new all-electric homes are comparable with those for homes that use gas in many parts of the country, and all-electric homes can be less expensive to operate over time, depending on electricity prices and many other factors. But they tend to be pricier in colder climates that require more powerful heat pumps[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/gas-furnace-heat-pump-11620846653] that can function in subfreezing temperatures. Such systems may require backup and can be costlier to run in the cold because they lose efficiency as temperatures drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost difference to build and operate all-electric homes and those that use gas is difficult to calculate because of the range of variables in the equation, and estimates vary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study by a research subsidiary of the National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span> published earlier this year estimated that building all-electric homes in the colder climates of Denver and Minneapolis may cost at least $11,000 more than ones that use gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research from the <span class="companylink">Rocky Mountain Institute</span>, a group that backs electrification, found that in Boston, building all-electric homes is competitive with those that use gas because developers can skip the infrastructure needed to support gas hookups and air conditioning systems. It concluded that all-electric homes are only marginally more expensive to operate over time, even in a state like Massachusetts, where retail electricity prices are among the highest in the nation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the new construction side, we're confident that there are actual savings," said Stephen Mushegan, a manager of RMI's carbon-free buildings program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some consumers are wary. Brian Callahan, an Arlington resident who recently purchased a nearby house to flip and sell, said he wouldn't consider building it to run entirely on electricity, even though he faces a long wait from the local utility for a new gas hookup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Natural gas is what sells," he said. "Unless I'm forced to build an electric house, people don't want it." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emerson Clauss III, president of the Home Builders and Remodelers Association of Massachusetts, has been lobbying against electrification measures and was recently asked to join a state commission to examine the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Clauss recently completed a major renovation of his own home and decided to buy an induction cooking range. But he stopped short of installing a heat pump system to replace an oil-fired furnace, choosing propane instead. He estimated it would have cost several thousand dollars more to go all electric, but ultimately the decision came down to perception and preference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm one of those people who likes the warmer feel of the heat," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ryan Dezember </div><div>651 words</div><div>31 July 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sawmill owners raked in huge profits when lumber prices shot up this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies that saw logs into two-by-fours and manufacture wood panels, including <span class="companylink">West Fraser Timber Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Canfor Corp</span>., reported second-quarter profits this week that topped earnings totals from their best years thanks to the pandemic forest-product frenzy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber prices, which had already broken records last summer, spiked during the spring quarter to more than twice their pre-pandemic high. Budgets were busted from apartment complexes down to garden planters. Wood costs threatened the housing boom and became central to the debate over whether runaway inflation was brewing or high prices were temporary and would ease as the economy moved further from lockdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though prices have dropped by more than 60% since May, when futures hit $1,711.20 per thousand board feet, lumber remains nearly as expensive as it ever was before the lockdowns. Futures for September delivery settled Friday at $621.20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many businesses, sawyers have contended with higher transportation costs, wages and energy bills. Crucially, though, the glut of mill-ready pine trees in the South kept log prices depressed and mill profit margins wide in the continent's most prolific lumber-producing region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price across the South for pine logs rose 3% during the quarter to $25.41 a ton, which is about what it was a decade ago at the depths of the housing crash, according to TimberMart-South, a pricing service affiliated with the University of Georgia's forestry school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sawmill companies are spending the windfalls to further consolidate and boost output, particularly in the South, where they have flocked for the cheap trees. They are also rewarding shareholders, who have suffered through some bad years since the housing bust, with special dividends and stock buybacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">West Fraser Timber</span> reported net income of $1.49 billion for April, May and June, an amount the company has historically needed years to earn. The results were boosted by its first full quarter owning panel-maker Norbord. The February acquisition made North America's largest lumber producer also its biggest manufacturer of oriented strand board, which is used to sheathe roofs, floors and walls and also rose to record prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">PotlatchDeltic Corp</span>., which owns timberland in six states and mills in four, said its wood-products division was more profitable in the latest quarter than it was during all of last year, which had been an annual record. Its $187.9 million of net income might have been even better if a fire hadn't knocked out its lumber mill in Ola, Ark., in mid-June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canfor, which operates 10 mills in western Canada and 12 in the U.S. South, followed suit reporting its own record quarter on Thursday. <span class="companylink">Weyerhaeuser Co</span>., the largest U.S. timberland owner and operator of mills in the U.S. and Canada, on Friday said it had its most profitable quarter ever by 40%, with net income of $1.03 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mill executives don't expect a repeat of the spring windfall, but they say wood prices could rise again given the wildfires that have prompted West Fraser and Canfor to curtail output in British Columbia, the potential for rebound in the overheated do-it-yourself market and the strong market for new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We actually fundamentally believe we went too high, and we think we've probably gone a bit too low in the correction," West Fraser's senior vice president of marketing and corporate development, Chris McIver, told investors Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders from retailers like <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>. dried up when prices got too high and Americans resumed spending on travel and entertainment. But home-improvement centers have resumed purchasing since prices have declined, said Eric Cremers, <span class="companylink">PotlatchDeltic</span>'s chief executive.</p>

Disgruntled locals have given it a new nickname: Boz Angeles.</span>
</div><div class="author">By Katherine Clarke </div><div>1837 words</div><div>30 July 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Dana and Erin Mahoney relocated from Los Angeles to Bozeman, Mont., some 15 years ago, the city, nestled in the Rocky Mountains, didn't even have a <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With three daughters under 6 at the time, Ms. Mahoney left her career in corporate real estate -- and the long commute that went with it -- in search of what she called a more wholesome environment, where the couple's children could grow up skiing and shoveling snow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think people at my work and in my life were taking bets that we'd be back within six months," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a decade later, with their youngest daughter going into her senior year in high school and their two older daughters attending, or having recently graduated from, college in North Carolina, the Mahoneys are making plans to move from Montana to the Raleigh area. They have sold their home, a luxury five-bedroom townhouse in downtown Bozeman, for nearly $1.75 million. Their decision to move was partly motivated by a desire to be closer to their children, Ms. Mahoney said, but also because the sleepy city they moved to has become, for better or for worse, almost unrecognizable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are now three <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> in downtown Bozeman, a <span class="companylink">Lululemon</span>, and many trendy restaurants and bars. Visitors drive the wrong way down one-way streets, Ms. Mahoney said, and revelers post pictures of their flights of beer from local breweries on social media. Some have started jokingly calling the city Boz Angeles -- although the population is around just 47,000, according to 2019 figures from the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>, up from about 37,000 in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everything is about the <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> opportunity," said Ms. Mahoney, 52.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transformation of Bozeman into a city popular with young professionals has helped ratchet up prices in the local housing market. The Mahoneys are some of the beneficiaries of that shift. The second prospective buyer to see their property -- and the first to see it in person -- bought it, paying almost twice what the Mahoneys paid in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the boom in the real-estate market in Bozeman predated the Covid-19 crisis, the pandemic sent it into overdrive, as out-of-staters flooded into the area, said local agents. They said they have had bidding wars with up to 30 offers on a single house. Many buyers are waiving inspection, appraisal and mortgage contingencies. Some locals are now choosing to cash in and move on to outlying towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 33 sales of Bozeman homes priced at $1 million or more between January and April, more than four times as many as during the year-earlier period, according to data from Realtor.com. The median sales price was $467,000, up 23.6% from the 2020 period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entry point for the luxury market, categorized by Realtor.com as the top 5% of sales, hit $1.03 million, up 43.9%. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The $1 million home five to 10 years ago is now the $2 million or $3 million home," said local agent Wallis Morger Bryan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, sales volume has slipped 6% year-to-year, according to Realtor.com, which attributed the drop to the dramatic inventory shortage in the area. Between January and April, home listings were down 71% compared with the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is not a new issue for Bozeman or a particularly unique thing for the Mountain West in general," said Andrew Hurlburt of Bozeman Real Estate Group, who said his company recently got 27 offers on a house they were listing, eventually selling for 24% over the asking price. "It has become a very acute problem in the last year with even more people moving to telecommuting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robyn and Paul Lundin of Seattle are among the out-of-staters who moved to Bozeman over the past year. Tired of being stuck at home during lockdowns, the couple, who both work remotely at technology companies, took a road trip to the Rocky Mountain West, through Idaho and Montana, and said they loved the laid-back culture and the proximity to nature. They both like to be on the slopes and to hike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Quite frankly, it was a lot more pleasant, a lot more friendly," said Mr. Lundin, 39. "People were a lot less kind of angry about random things in life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They initially considered moving to Boise, Idaho, but Ms. Lundin's company wasn't set up to have employees in that state, so they eventually settled on Bozeman. They thought the home search might take at least six months, but they soon realized the market was moving at warp speed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, they purchased a four-bedroom modern farmhouse-style home in a subdivision on the east side of Bozeman at the base of the Bridger mountains for $1.165 million, just above the $1.09 million asking price. The home was across the street from a trailhead for their Italian Mastiff, Amos, and the subdivision was eclectic, with industrial-style and quirky modern homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't want to live in a subdevelopment that's full of beige houses. I couldn't do that," Mr. Lundin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price represented a 56% rise from what the sellers paid in August 2020, records show. As many as six others bid on the house, the couple said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lundin said out-of-towners like them were likely better equipped than the locals to stomach the price growth in Bozeman, having had experience navigating more expensive markets. He is originally from New York and she is originally from San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vince Cole, a private-equity executive, and his wife, Elizabeth Cole, who works in human resources for a major insurance firm, recently relocated to Bozeman from New York City, where they had found themselves cramped in a Chelsea apartment during the height of the pandemic. Mr. Cole had attended <span class="companylink">Montana State University</span> and knew the Bozeman area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think when we saw that second wave kind of hit, we thought, 'All right, this isn't going away anytime soon,'" said Mr. Cole, adding that the couple can both work remotely long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They quickly made an off-market deal. They bought a three-bedroom, stone house in Bridger Canyon from the actor Aaron Eckhart for close to $4 million, Mr. Cole said. It has reclaimed timber beams, stone fireplaces and plank hardwood floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some Bozeman locals, such as real-estate agent and ski instructor Brenna Kelleher, 38, who grew up in the area and works with PureWest Christie's International Real Estate, it seems like now is time to either move away or buy before prices get further out of control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she has been wanting to own a property with some land for a long time and thought she should do it now or soon she wouldn't be able to afford it. In May, she bought a ranchette, located between Bozeman and the ski-resort community of Big Sky, for about $1.25 million. It has several acres for her horses and her Australian shepherd, Patsy Cline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her first offer on the house wasn't accepted, but when another deal fell through, she quickly contacted the sellers to resubmit her offer. She waived her inspection and appraisal contingency to secure the deal. With so many cash buyers in the market, she said she felt she had to be aggressive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The sticker shock is definitely there. It's there 100%," she said. "But you have to think about how much do you love the area. Do you love the community? And if you can afford it, do you want to still continue to be a part of it? My answer was yes. But a lot of people's answer is going to be no."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Bozeman's transformation started well before the pandemic is evidenced by the growing number of flights at the local Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average number of flights departing from the airport rose from 17 in 2011 to 35 in 2021, according to airport director Brian Sprenger. During that period, flights to San Francisco and Los Angeles went from seasonal to year-round schedules, while new destinations were added, such as New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., Chicago and Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local real-estate agents say the Yellowstone Club, the private members-only ski resort about 50 miles from Bozeman near Yellowstone National Park, helped put Bozeman on the map, with celebrity members and guests including Ben Affleck, Bill Gates and Justin Timberlake. Occasionally, such notables venture into Bozeman for dinner or drinks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The singer John Mayer also helped draw attention to the area when he bought a ranch in the Livingston area near Bozeman in the early 2010s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, real-estate agents say buyers are bringing up the television show "Yellowstone," starring Kevin Costner as a rancher, as being part of their inspiration for relocating to Montana. (The irony is that much of the show's early seasons were filmed in Utah.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actor Taylor Kitsch, known for his role on the television show "Friday Night Lights," also recently bought in Bozeman. The four-bedroom, contemporary industrial-style home blends steel, glass and wood, and has its own wine cellar, gym and vault, according to the listing. It was listed at $2.795 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the boom has brought new opportunities to the area, some Bozeman locals say it has a down side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything is more expensive, from restaurants to hotels, and there is a worry that the area will become too expensive for locals. Also, the city is losing its laid-back, small-town vibe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People don't wave so often when they pass you on dirt roads and some honk their horns, which used to be extremely rare, locals said. The trailheads on the edge of the city are much busier and trail etiquette has declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kelleher said she is used to stopping along the trail to have conversations with friends and neighbors. Now, she said the trails draw newcomers who can be what she calls aggro and who just zoom by without a word. "You're like, 'Whoa, that's kind of rude,'" she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the upside, Mr. Hurlburt said he is hopeful that local kids no longer have to leave Montana in search of a job now that more companies are moving to the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They used to say that the greatest export from Montana was our beef and our children," Mr. Hurlburt said. "Now, we've got a chance to keep our next generation here in Bozeman with us."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Julia-Ambra Verlaine </div><div>671 words</div><div>29 July 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A red-hot U.S. housing market is enabling banks to sell a new kind of bond that shares the risk of mortgage and loan defaults with institutional investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                        <span class="companylink">Texas Capital Bank</span> recently sold $275 million of securities to investors looking to cash in on the pandemic-fueled boom in home prices. The bonds are backed by short-term loans the bank makes to mortgage lenders. When those lenders' borrowers default, the investors in the bonds effectively cover the loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transfers are a product of the effort to shield <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> from the risk of a mortgage-market reversal. Banks are now using them to raise capital and otherwise shore up their balance sheets, a process that ultimately adds to their lending capacity, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks including <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. have recently increased sales of risk-transfer securities tied to mortgages, auto loans and corporate debt. However, the entry of regional banks marks a new phase in the market's expansion, said Simon Boughey, an analyst at Structured Credit Investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The addition of <span class="companylink">Texas Capital Bank</span> to the roster in March this year shows there is potential for this mechanism to grow," said Mr. Boughey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the risk transfers revive memories of the financial products that boomed before the financial crisis, investors said they remain a niche product, supported by a surging housing market and a recovery that has improved borrowers' credit quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors lose if the underlying loans default but receive relatively high yields in return. The average yield that investors demand to hold the riskiest version of the investment is more than 5%. That compares with 1.89% for the 30-year <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> and around 4% for corporate bonds, according to data from <span class="companylink">Intercontinental Exchange</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average yield on mortgage-backed securities was 1.36% as of July 22, according to an ICE Bank of America index. That compares with nearly 2.4% in February 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People want exposure to housing and consumer markets that are performing," said Kaustub Samant, a securities analyst at JPMorgan. "Risk transfer securities are one of the few places that give high returns in this environment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a housing shortage, coupled with surging demand from Americans fleeing cities or buying bigger homes, drove U.S. home prices to their biggest annual increase in more than two decades in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has pushed up the value of real estate occupied by owners to $34 trillion as of the end of the first quarter of 2021, according to data provider <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>. Nearly $1 trillion of those gains took place in the first three months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan Osborn, a bond manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said he held a limited amount of credit-risk transfers backed by Fannie and Freddie over the past few years but bought more after the market selloff last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That changed significantly after March of 2020," said Mr. Osborn. "Not only did valuations become considerably more attractive but the fundamental story around housing and interest rates changed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While investors often turn to conventional mortgage-backed securities to make bets on the housing market, central-bank policy has squeezed returns. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s efforts to boost the economy through the pandemic include buying $40 billion of mortgage bonds each month, alongside $80 billion of Treasury debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While hedge funds were among the earliest buyers of credit-risk transfers, conventional asset managers are also adding to their positions. Prices fell when the pandemic roiled markets, attracting bargain-hunters. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> also curtailed issuance, leaving more investors chasing fewer securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Smith, a portfolio manager in global securitized products at <span class="companylink">Neuberger Berman</span>, said his funds have added credit-risk transfers from Fannie and Freddie, betting on growth to raise housing prices and borrowers' credit quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have consistently been involved in the product, but this year presented an outsized opportunity," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>473 words</div><div>28 July 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth climbed to a record in May, as low mortgage interest rates continued to drive robust home-buying demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 16.6% in the year that ended in May, up from a 14.8% annual rate the prior month. May marked the highest annual rate of price growth since the index began in 1987.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth has accelerated in the past year as buyers competed fiercely for a limited number of homes on the market. The Covid-19 pandemic spurred households to seek out more living space, and interest rates have held near record lows. Many homes are getting multiple offers and selling above asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median existing-home sales price in June rose 23.4% from a year earlier to $363,300, a record, the National Association of Realtors said earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's an incredibly strong housing market," said Hilla Sferruzza, chief financial officer at home builder Meritage Homes Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-buying frenzy has slowed slightly this summer as more homeowners have listed their houses for sale and high prices have deterred some buyers. Fast-rising prices are making homes less affordable, especially to first-time buyers. But there is still more demand than supply, industry executives and economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's probably some sticker shock happening out there," Ms. Sferruzza said. But as some buyers are priced out of the market, "at least for now, there's enough other folks that are willing to step into their shoes," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are struggling to keep up with demand due to labor shortages and volatile material costs.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>854 words</div><div>26 July 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOENIX -- Once a poster child for the foreclosure crisis, Phoenix's housing market is booming again, boosted by robust population growth and relative affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix was a hot market before the pandemic, and it has been a major beneficiary of new remote-work policies, as workers in expensive cities decided to move for cheaper housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as home prices in Phoenix soar, housing in the area is still cheap compared with many other big cities in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix-area median existing-home price was $399,900 in June, up 31.1% from a year earlier, according to the Arizona Regional Multiple Listing Service. That is more than $100,000 below the median home prices in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Ore., and Denver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When people come here from Seattle and Portland, they are thrilled at what they can buy," said Alan Jones, division president for home builder Lennar Corp. "And from California, they go beyond being thrilled."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix home prices have risen faster on an annual basis than any other metro area in the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller 20-City Composite Home Price Index for 23 straight months, matching the record streak set by Portland from 1990 to 1992. If Phoenix holds on to the No. 1 spot when the May index data is released Tuesday, it would mark the longest a city has held the record for fastest annual growth in data going back to 1987, according to <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index, which measures repeat-sales data and reports on a two-month delay, doesn't include some U.S. cities that are also experiencing rapid price growth, such as Austin, Texas, and Boise, Idaho.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix's price appreciation, while dramatic, is more subdued than during the early 2000s, when year-over-year price growth in the area soared above 40%, according to the Case-Shiller data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the last housing boom, relaxed lending standards, speculative home buying and robust construction activity led to an oversupply of housing. The housing crash and 2007-09 recession hit Phoenix hard. New construction declined and home prices plunged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the current housing boom is less risky than the last one because mortgage-lending standards are stricter and the U.S. has a shortage of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coming out of the crisis, Phoenix became a destination for new players looking to get into the housing market. Big investment companies started buying up thousands of homes to rent out. Computer-driven house flippers, known as iBuyers, targeted Phoenix as an early market for expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix economy became more diversified and less dependent on cyclical industries like tourism. Moody's Analytics expects the region to add more than 100,000 jobs in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area's onetime surplus of housing has been absorbed. Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, added 11% more housing supply between 2010 and 2020 while its population grew by 20%, according to Census Bureau data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the once-remote exurbs are hot again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I used to say this when the market crashed before: 'Where'd all the money go?'" said Nate Martinez, a real-estate agent based in Surprise, Ariz. "Now it's like, where's all this money coming from? It's just crazy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tina and Craig Vanderlei bought a new home currently under construction in Surprise, about 45 minutes from Phoenix. They have been renting a house near Santa Barbara, Calif., for five years, and had been waiting for prices there to go down so they could buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We would love to be able to stay here [in California], but the opportunity is so much greater in the Phoenix area, with jobs and things to do," said Ms. Vanderlei, who is 52 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix market has cooled slightly in recent months as skyrocketing prices have prompted more sellers to list their homes, but buyers are still competing for a very limited supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix-area existing-home inventory in June was 29.6% below a year earlier, according to ARMLS. And most builders in the area are capping sales of to-be-built homes to make sure they don't sell more houses than they can build, said Steven Hensley, advisory manager at housing-research firm Zonda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local buyers are struggling to compete with new arrivals. Phoenix rents are up 17% from a year ago, outpacing an 8.4% increase nationwide, according to listings platform <span class="companylink">Apartment List</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Morgan decided to buy a home when his landlord talked about raising his monthly rent to $1,500 from $1,000. "You're going to go look at places and there's a line -- it's like going to the grocery store, there's three, four people ahead of you and behind you," Mr. Morgan said. "It's like you never have a chance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After losing out on multiple offers, he bought a two-bedroom condo in Phoenix for $195,000.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continued strong demand pushed the median U.S. home price to a record high in June, though the national house-buying frenzy cooled slightly as supply ticked higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 1.4% in June from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.86 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. June sales rose 22.9% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median existing-home price rose to $363,300, in June, up 23.4% from a year earlier, setting a record high, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said, extending steady price increases amid limited inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate figures on the labor market showed that the number of people receiving jobless benefits fell to the lowest level since early in the pandemic as states withdrew from participation in federal pandemic relief. First-time applications, meanwhile, rose as supply constraints persisted in the auto industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing-market boom is easing slightly, as rising prices are prompting more homeowners to list their houses for sale. Homes sold in June received four offers on average, down from five offers the previous month, said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. But the number of homes for sale remains far lower than normal, and robust demand due to ultralow mortgage-interest rates is expected to continue pushing home prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As more homes come on the market, they are quickly snapped up, said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Demand is trumping everything," he said. "Higher inventory isn't going to take the brakes off price increases."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homes are selling above listing price and receiving multiple offers. The typical home sold in June was on the market for 17 days, holding at a record low, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dana Laboy and John Niehaus of Columbus, Ohio, started shopping in February for a house costing $400,000 or less, but they raised their budget after losing out on multiple offers, Ms. Laboy said. "When we were losing out on houses left and right every weekend for eight weekends in a row, it was very demoralizing," Ms. Laboy said. "I did not think that we would offer up to $40,000 over and still not get it, like we did in some cases."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple's rental lease ended in March and they moved in with Mr. Niehaus's parents while they continued house hunting. They bought a three-bedroom house in June for $447,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 1.25 million homes for sale at the end of June, up 3.3% from May and down 18.8% from June 2020. At the current sales pace, there was a 2.6-month supply of homes on the market at the end of June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building activity has increased due to the strong demand, but home builders are limited by labor availability, land supply and material costs. A measure of U.S. home-builder confidence declined in July, the National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span> said this week. Housing starts, a measure of U.S. home-building, rose 6.3% in June from May, the Commerce Department said earlier this week.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers during the pandemic have been willing to take on long commutes in exchange for lower prices, a new analysis shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some of the nation's most expensive metro areas, home prices rose faster in areas with longer morning commutes to business districts compared with neighborhoods with short commutes, according to an analysis from <span class="companylink">Zillow Group Inc</span>. and Here Technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a reversal from prior years, when home prices in those metro areas accelerated faster in neighborhoods close to job centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the change reflects that commute length has declined in importance for home buyers, as many workers expect to travel to their offices less often. At the same time, rapidly rising prices have made affordability a bigger concern for many buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been a big change," said Ed Pinto, director of the AEI Housing Center at the <span class="companylink">American Enterprise Institute</span>, who expects the shift in home-buyer demand to be long-lasting. "There's a huge group of people who can work from home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Boston metro area, for example, the Zillow analysis shows that neighborhoods within a 10- or 20-minute commute of a job center posted the fastest home-price growth in the metro area during the two-year periods ended in May in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the two-year period ended in May 2021, home values in neighborhoods with a 70-minute commute rose 30.2%, strongly outpacing a 9.2% price gain for 20-minute-commute areas and a price decline of 2.5% for neighborhoods within 10 minutes of a job center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In a lot of those more expensive markets, there was a lot of draw to being close to the workplace" before the pandemic, to avoid a long commute and enjoy urban amenities, said Nicole Bachaud, economic data analyst at Zillow. "Remote work gave people the opportunity to question, 'Is this somewhere that I want to live?'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In metro areas where the downtown job centers are traditionally cheaper to live in than the suburbs, home buyers still sought out affordability, the analysis showed. In cities such as Baltimore, Detroit and Indianapolis, home prices grew fastest in areas with short commutes in the two years ended in May 2021.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How important is commute time to you when choosing a place to live? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow used Census Bureau data to select the ZIP Codes that function as job centers and data from location-data company HERE Technologies to determine commuting distances. The distances are based on local 8 a.m. Monday commutes in late May 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers and real-estate executives are watching closely to see whether consumers' preference for affordability over a short commute is a trend that will last beyond the pandemic. In some industries, workers expect to work from home at least part of the time in the future. But many companies are still determining their remote-work policies[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/remote-work-is-the-new-signing-bonus-11624680029], and workers might regret their long commutes if they have to go to their offices more often than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commute times vary by metro area, but they had been rising before the pandemic. The average commute to work in the U.S. took 27.6 minutes in 2019, up from 25.3 minutes in 2010, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increased remote work could reduce commute times[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/remote-work-is-the-new-signing-bonus-11624680029] overall, if fewer workers are headed to city centers during rush hours. But as home buyers move to farther-flung neighborhoods, they are also likely to be more dependent on cars[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/afternoons-are-the-new-rush-hour-in-the-suburbs-11621157403] for local trips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, median home prices in areas with few public transportation options rose 32.8% between January 2020 and May 2021, while home prices in transit-accessible neighborhoods rose 15.6% in the same period, real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>. said earlier this month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vlach expects to switch to public transit, which would take more than an hour each way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The hour and 36 minutes did not look as daunting last year. We had so many other things on our mind" when deciding to move, he said. "If I had to do it all over, maybe I'd focus a little more on [the] commute, but it's way too late for that."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For first-time buyers looking for starter homes[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/for-some-millennials-a-starter-home-is-hard-to-find-11625391002] in this year's hot housing market, a decadeslong trend could further delay this long-awaited money milestone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of entry-level housing[http://www.freddiemac.com/perspectives/sam_khater/20210415_single_family_shortage.page], which <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> defines as homes up to 1,400 square feet, is near a five-decade low, and data on new construction[https://eyeonhousing.org/2021/02/growth-ahead-for-new-single-family-home-size/]from the National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span> shows that single-family homes are significantly bigger than they were years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners from previous generations had access to smaller homes at the start of their financial lives. In the late 1970s, an average of 418,000 new units of entry-level housing were built each year, according to data from <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. By the 2010s, that number had fallen to 55,000 new units a year. For 2020, an estimated 65,000 new entry-level homes were completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can really draw a straight line from the 1940s down to the most recent years, which is really striking and also very concerning," said Sam Khater, chief economist and head of <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s Economic and Housing Research division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Khater said he initially expected to see this drop most acutely in historically expensive metropolitan areas such as New York and San Francisco. But looking across the country, he saw that house hunters in many different areas were facing the same problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What was really striking to me was the consistency in the decline in the share of entry-level homes, irrespective of geography," Mr. Khater said. "The thing that struck me the most was that really, it's all endemic. It's all over the U.S. It doesn't matter where."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This phenomenon is affecting real estate in 10 of the largest states, according to an analysis from <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. In Florida, for example, the share of homes with living area up to 1,400 square feet was 58% of new housing supply in 1985. Thirty years later, the share plummeted to 12%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Homeownership leads to greater wealth[https://www.urban.org/research/publication/future-headship-and-homeownership] for those who buy earlier. An analysis from the Urban Institute estimates that those who became homeowners between the ages of 25 and 34 accumulated $150,000 in median housing wealth by their early 60s. Meanwhile, those who waited until between the ages of 35 and 44 to buy netted $72,000 less in median housing wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Kevin Crowder, a 52-year-old homeowner and economic-development consultant, bought his first starter home in 2003, he found a 1,000-square-foot apartment in the Miami area. In 2006, he bought what he said is his largest home ever: a two-bedroom house at 1,250 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's insane what you see in the single-family market here with the pricing," he said. "I would disagree that larger is needed. I think smaller is needed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eager buyers have sparked bidding wars in many places, as remote work allows them to expand their house hunts. Further challenges—the crush of the student-loan crisis and ongoing wage stagnation—make it difficult for some to save a competitive down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've got a record number of entry-level, demand buyers: the millennials coming into the market," Mr. Khater said. "And yet we've had a seven- or eight-year decline in entry-level homes, and that's not going to change."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billings, Mont., is the new No. 1 on The Wall Street Journal/Realtor.com Emerging Housing Markets Index, boosted by its affordability and appeal to remote workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index reflects how the housing boom has ignited homebuying activity in smaller to midsize U.S. cities. The top 20 cities in the ranking have an average population size of just over 300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest index rankings, smaller cities dominate. The No. 2 metro area is Coeur d'Alene, the lakeside Idaho city that held the top position when the index premiered in April. Fort Wayne, Ind., Rapid City, S.D., and Raleigh, N.C., round out the top 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index identifies the top metro areas for home buyers seeking an appreciating housing market and appealing lifestyle amenities. This quarter's version added the new criterion of real-estate taxes, which caused some areas in the Northeast, Midwest and Texas with higher property taxes to fall in the rankings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strengthening U.S. economy also played a role, rewarding cities where employment and wages grew the most. Rapid City and Raleigh each jumped about 100 spots from the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billings rose from the fourth spot to the first due to its low unemployment, affordability and booming housing market. With a metro-area population of about 184,000, Billings had a 3% unemployment rate in May, or about half the national rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the strength in the Billings market has been driven by out-of-state buyers -- from coastal states like California and Washington to Kentucky and Texas, said Deb Parker, broker owner of Parker &amp; Co. Real Estate Services in Billings. Many move because they have the flexibility to work remotely, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I believe Montana's truly been discovered," Ms. Parker said. "I've never seen so much cash in our market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 65% of page views on Billings property listings came from outside the metro area in the second quarter, up from about 57% a year earlier, according to Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, parent of The Wall Street Journal, operates Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emily and Travis Elwood decided during the pandemic that they wanted to move out of Portland, Ore., where they were renting a two-bedroom apartment. They visited Billings last summer and were attracted to its size and affordability. "Frankly, [we] were never going to be able to buy a home in the Portland area," Ms. Elwood said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Elwood continued working at her Oregon job from Montana, and Mr. Elwood found a new job in Billings at a dental company. They moved in October and bought a three-bedroom house in June for $316,000. Their monthly mortgage payment is lower than their monthly rent was in Portland, Ms. Elwood said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller markets in Montana, including Bozeman, also saw an influx of buyers during the pandemic. Some of the top reasons out-of-state buyers chose Montana were safety and security, concerns about Covid-19 and the smaller population, according to a survey of Montana real-estate agents by <span class="companylink">Montana State University</span> Billings last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average single-family home-sale price in Billings and the surrounding area was $376,248 in June, up 32% from a year earlier, according to the Billings Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in many markets around the country, the number of homes for sale is very low. There were 392 single-family listings in the Billings area in June, down from 433 a year earlier, the association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was not a lot out there," said Claire Alden, who started house shopping in Billings with her husband, Deaver Alden, this spring. "There was only one or two on the market at a time that we would consider at all."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Aldens put in their first offer on a house, they found out the seller had already accepted a cash offer the same day the house went on the market. They ended up buying a four-bedroom house in June with a shed that they are considering converting into a rental property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the top 20 markets in the index have risen 13.7% on average in the past year, outpacing an 8% rise for all 300 areas, but the top 20 areas still had a lower median listing price than the market overall, said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. home prices are surging as the country's economy reopens from the pandemic, and U.S. investors are getting in on the action by snapping up home-building companies at bargain prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales prices last month were 13.4% higher than they were in June 2020, according to the House Price Index published by the <span class="companylink">Nationwide Building Society</span>, one of Britain's biggest mortgage lenders. This is the strongest annual growth seen since 2004 and has raised average prices to almost GBP 250,000, equivalent to about $342,000, the Society said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real-estate market just goes on growing and growing," said Raul Cimesa, head of London new homes at real-estate agent Knight Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite this rise in prices, many home builders have seen some value wiped off their share prices during the pandemic partly because real-estate agents and many construction sites were forced to close for about two months during last year's spring lockdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. investment firms are taking advantage of this disconnect. They are targeting the home sales market in London's suburbs and regional towns and cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am sure investors are seeing really good value in investing in housing at the moment," Ben Babington, director of house builder Trilogy Land &amp; New Homes Ltd., said. "Share prices have taken a bit of a battering during the crisis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, for example, Lone Star Real Estate Fund, of Dallas, acquired retirement-home builder McCarthy Stone for GBP 647 million, or GBP 1.20 a share. The shares were trading above GBP 1.50 in early 2020 before the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group Inc</span>. is completing a deal to buy <span class="companylink">St. Modwen Properties PLC</span>, a FTSE 250 house builder and logistics company, for GBP 1.25 billion. According to its most recent annual report, St. Modwen, which builds homes to sell and rents commercial buildings, had profit of GBP 22.1 million in 2020, down from GBP 38.7 million in the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     James Seppala, head of Blackstone Real Estate Europe, said St. Modwen would be given "significant additional capital" to expand its output -- mainly building family homes in and around regional towns and cities. He declined to provide more details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">St. Modwen holds a property portfolio valued at GBP 1.37 billion and sold 948 homes in 2020. However, its profit fell sharply in 2020, according to its annual report, because of "the nine to 10 weeks of lost production during the lockdown in spring" plus reductions in rental income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. investors also are taking advantage of the weak pound. "Five or six years ago, the exchange rate was around $1.80 to $1.90, today it is more like $1.40," Mr. Cimesa of Knight Frank said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. home prices increased during the pandemic mostly thanks to a temporary amnesty on taxes paid by buyers, known as the Stamp Duty, on homes priced up to GBP 500,000. The amnesty was introduced by the government last summer offering a potential saving of GBP 15,000 on each property sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a severe shortage of housing stock for sale. There are currently 16 house hunters chasing every property on the market, according to real-estate agents' organization NAEA Propertymark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is clearly a huge appetite for homeownership, there is currently a real shortage of homes, and the government supports the sale of new homes," Mr. Babington of Trilogy Land &amp; New Homes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agent Savills forecasts that prices will keep growing but at a slower pace after the Stamp Duty holiday ends in September. The firm predicts a 21.1% growth in prices between 2020 and 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All the statistics are saying that this is a situation that will continue for the foreseeable future," Mr. Babington said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After more than a year working from home during a pandemic, many Americans are rethinking whether they want to return to commuting—or even live near their office at all. Smaller and more rural housing markets are emerging as the hottest new places to live and own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help home buyers decide on the best place to make housing investments, The Wall Street Journal collaborated with Realtor.com[https://www.realtor.com/] to rank which housing markets are expected to provide both a strong return on investment—and are a nice place to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This second release of The Wall Street Journal/realtor.com Emerging Housing Markets Index builds on our first release[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/emerging-housing-markets-index-wsj-realtor-com-11619483158] by adding consideration of local property taxes, helping filter out places where it might be inexpensive to buy, but expensive to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is Billings, Mont., at the top of the list? Read more about the city here[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/montana-boomtown-jumps-to-no-1-on-wsj-realtor-com-housing-market-index-11626773400].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While other market-by-market comparisons focus only on housing metrics, the WSJ/Realtor.com Emerging Housing Markets Index also looks at nonhousing indicators to help identify places that are not only good places to invest, but also where you are likely to enjoy living. The index is updated quarterly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Methodology</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In order to identify the top emerging housing markets, The Wall Street Journal and Realtor.com reviewed data for the 300 most populous core-based statistical areas, as measured by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>. (Note: The Wall Street Journal and Realtor.com are both owned by parent company News Corp[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/market-data/quotes/NWS].)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall methodology explores two main areas: real-estate markets (50%) and economic health (50%). Those two areas comprise eight key indicators:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-Estate Supply (16.6%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures the relative scarcity of real estate for sale in a market compared with others based on real-estate listings' median number of days on the market. Markets with a high supply score have relatively few days on the market compared with other areas. That relatively limited supply is likely to lead to home-price growth. In contrast, markets with a low supply score have more days on the market compared with other areas, indicating that relatively abundant supply will help alleviate pressure on home prices. (Source: Realtor.com. Updated monthly. Current data is June 2021.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-Estate Demand (16.6%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures the relative abundance of real-estate demand in a market compared with other markets based on the average number of unique viewers per real-estate listing. Markets with a high demand score have a relatively large number of unique viewers per home. That abundant buyer demand is likely to lead to home-price growth. In contrast, markets with a low demand score have a smaller number of unique viewers per real-estate listing, indicating that more limited buyer demand will help curb upward pressure on home prices. (Source: Realtor.com. Updated monthly. Current data is June 2021.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median Home Listing Price Trend (16.6%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures recent home-price performance compared with other markets based on typical asking prices for real-estate listings that are active on Realtor.com. (Source: Realtor.com. Updated monthly. Current data is June 2021.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment (6.25%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures the relative health of the local job market. Data consists of the estimated percentage of the civilian noninstitutional population 16 years of age and older who weren't employed during the reference period. The seasonally adjusted series is used in the index. (Source: <span class="companylink">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>. Updated monthly. Current data is May 2021.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wages (6.25%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures the relative quality of employment in the area in terms of total wages. Data consists of the median usual weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers, before taxes and other deductions, including any overtime pay, commissions or tips. Doesn't include self-employed workers. (Source: <span class="companylink">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>. Updated quarterly. Current data is for the fourth quarter of 2020.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regional price parities (6.25%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures how expensive it is to live and work in a metro area. RPP consists of differences in price levels across metropolitan areas for a given year, expressed as a percentage of the overall national price level. RPP covers all consumer goods and services, including housing rents. (Source: <span class="companylink">U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis</span>. Updated yearly. Current data is for 2019.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amenities (6.25%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures livability of an area in terms of available amenities, as represented by chain stores known for "everyday splurge" purchases, a signal of discretionary consumer income. Data consists of the number of Starbucks[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/market-data/quotes/SBUX], <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> and Trader Joe's locations within the area, per capita. (Source: WSJ analysis of publicly available store locations. Updated monthly. Current data is for June 2021.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commute (6.25%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures quality of life in terms of how long residents have to spend every day getting to and from work. Data consists of average one-way travel time among workers ages 16 years and older who didn't work from home. (Source: <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>. Updated yearly. Current data is for 2019.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign-born Residents (6.25%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures the economic health and diversity of an area as represented by the portion of the populace that was born outside the U.S. Studies indicate a strong correlation between the economic vitality of a region and the number of foreign-born residents. (Source: <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>. Updated yearly. Current data is for 2019.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small Businesses (6.25%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures the economic health and diversity of an area as represented by small-business activity. Data consists of the number of granted SBA 7(a) loans per capita. (Source: <span class="companylink">U.S. Small Business Administration</span>. Updated quarterly. Current data is for loans granted in calendar year 2020.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property Taxes (6.25%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New to the index this quarter. Measures real-estate taxes based on median home price. Areas with higher effective real-estate taxes are ranked lower while areas with lower effective real-estate taxes are ranked higher. (Source: <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>. Updated yearly. Current data is for 2019.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Final Score</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each indicator is indexed in order to normalize the data, and a composite score is produced by adding those values for each geography. The sums are sorted to produce the final ranking. If two or more U.S. metropolitan areas tie in their final score, then the Real Estate Demand indicator is used to break the tie.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billings, Mont., is the new No. 1 on The Wall Street Journal/Realtor.com Emerging Housing Markets Index[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/see-the-full-rankings-for-wsj-realtor-coms-emerging-housing-markets-index-11626756019], boosted by its affordability and appeal to remote workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index reflects how the housing boom has ignited homebuying activity in smaller to midsize cities[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/real-estate-frenzy-overwhelms-small-town-america-i-came-home-crying-11621511972] around the U.S. The top 20 cities in the ranking have an average population size of just over 300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest index rankings published on Tuesday, smaller cities dominate. The No. 2 metro area is Coeur d'Alene[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/lakeside-idaho-city-is-americas-hottest-housing-market-in-new-wsj-realtor-com-index-11619515802], the lakeside Idaho city that held the top position when the index premiered in April. Fort Wayne, Ind., Rapid City, S.D., and Raleigh, N.C., round out the top 5.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ reporters Nicole Friedman and David Ewalt and Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale discussed the real-estate market and our latest ranking of U.S. metro areas. Watch a replay.[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/live-qa/ask-wsj-emerging-real-estate-markets-in-the-us/8CA85487-0AAB-4656-B446-D055F7D797FA]
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index identifies the top metro areas for home buyers seeking an appreciating housing market and appealing lifestyle amenities. This quarter's version added the new criteria of real-estate taxes, which caused some areas in the Northeast, Midwest and Texas with higher property taxes to fall in the rankings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strengthening U.S. economy also played a role, rewarding cities where employment and wages grew the most. Rapid City and Raleigh each jumped by about 100 spots from the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billings, the biggest city in Montana, rose from the fourth spot to the first due to its low unemployment, affordability and booming housing market. With a metro-area population of about 184,000, Billings had a 3% unemployment rate in May, or about half the national rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the strength in the Billings housing market has been driven by out-of-state buyers—from coastal states like California and Washington to Kentucky and Texas, said Deb Parker, broker owner of Parker &amp; Co. Real Estate Services in Billings. Many move to the area because they have the flexibility to work remotely, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I believe Montana's truly been discovered," Ms. Parker said. "I've never seen so much cash in our market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 65% of page views on Billings property listings came from outside the metro area in the second quarter, up from about 57% a year earlier, according to Realtor.com.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billings, surrounded by multiple mountain ranges, was founded as a 19th-century railroad town. Today, new residents are drawn to the area's hiking trails and other outdoor activities. Yet unlike some smaller U.S. cities, where second-home buyers have played a notable role moving in and boosting housing prices, about 3% of Billings homes are vacation properties, according to Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like much of the West[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fires-in-oregon-california-grow-as-heat-wave-continues-in-parts-of-west-11626705287], Billings is currently experiencing extreme heat[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/western-states-bake-in-another-weekend-of-intense-heat-as-wildfires-spread-11626560700]. The National Weather Service has issued a red-flag warning in the area, which indicates weather conditions that could accelerate the spread of wildfires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emily and Travis Elwood decided during the pandemic that they wanted to move out of Portland, Ore., where they were renting a two-bedroom apartment. They visited Billings last summer and were attracted to its size and affordability. "Frankly, [we] were never going to be able to buy a home in the Portland area," Ms. Elwood said. "We just wanted something a little bit smaller, a little bit tighter knit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Elwood continued working at her Oregon job from Montana, and Mr. Elwood found a new job in Billings at a dental company. They moved in October and bought a three-bedroom house in June for $316,000. Their monthly mortgage payment is lower than their monthly rent was in Portland, Ms. Elwood said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller markets in Montana, including Bozeman, also saw an influx of buyers[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/tech-workers-take-to-the-mountains-bringing-silicon-valley-with-them-11604242802] during the pandemic. Some of the top reasons out-of-state buyers chose Montana were safety and security, concerns about Covid-19 and the state's smaller population, according to a survey of Montana real-estate agents by <span class="companylink">Montana State University</span> Billings last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average single-family home-sale price in Billings and the surrounding area was $376,248 in June, up 32% from a year earlier, according to the Billings Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in many markets around the country, the number of homes for sale is very low. There were 392 single-family listings in the Billings area in June, down from 433 a year earlier, the association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was not a lot out there," said Claire Alden, who started house shopping in Billings with her husband, Deaver Alden, this spring. "There was only one or two on the market at a time that we would consider at all."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Aldens put in their first offer on a house, they found out the seller had already accepted a cash offer the same day the house went on the market. They ended up buying a four-bedroom house in June with a shed in the back that they are considering converting into a rental property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal/Realtor.com Emerging Housing Markets Index ranks the 300 biggest metro areas in the U.S. In addition to housing-market indicators, the index incorporates economic and lifestyle data, including unemployment rate, wages, commute time and small-business loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the top 20 markets in the index have risen 13.7% on average in the past year, outpacing an 8% rise for all 300 areas, but the top 20 areas still had a lower median listing price than the market overall, said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan S. Blinder's op-ed "Don't Worry Too Much About the Inflation Surge" (July 8) omits an important part of the inflation story. Reported inflation can't go back to the double-digits of the 1970s and '80s because it is measured differently nowadays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price inflation index of the 1970s and early '80s included house prices, but the modern version of reported inflation uses a nonmarket rent for owners' housing costs. Adjusting the current numbers for house-price inflation would push the CPI close to double-digit gains.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Patrick Coleman bought a home in 2017, he beat out eight other bidders and paid $100,000 over the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So this time around, after months of watching the frenzied pace of real-estate sales, he was prepared for even more competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, it was much easier. Mr. Coleman wasn't even looking for a home. He and his fiancée, image consultant Rebecca Jahangeri, loved their townhouse in Washington, D.C.[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/covid-19-kindled-washington-d-c-s-luxury-market-the-new-administration-could-make-it-even-hotter-11611249368] But in late May, he glanced at a listing his father had sent his sister in their native Potomac, Md. "She wasn't interested," Mr. Coleman recalled, "but I texted my dad and I said, 'Man, I might buy this thing.' " Two days later, he and Ms. Jahangeri toured the six-bedroom brick Colonial and made an offer. Within a few hours, it was accepted. It was the first house they saw, and there were no other bidders. They closed in June for $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was a little surprised, that's for sure," said Mr. Coleman, 34, a vice president at Jim Coleman Automotive Group. "I feel lucky."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems the wild residential real-estate market[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-markets-sale-covid-11620925226] of the past year is finally starting to calm down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More houses are coming on the market, real-estate experts said. For high-end properties in particular, inventory is increasing as owners who delayed selling during the worst of the pandemic list their homes. Owners who weren't planning to sell have changed their minds after watching prices climb ever higher. Meanwhile, some deals made at the height of the frenzy have fallen through, while overpriced homes sit rather than getting snapped up immediately. The market is still hot, with strong demand buoyed by low interest rates, agents said, but buyers now have more options as a sense of normalcy returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The sales market is not a frenzy anymore," said Andrea Ackerman, a real-estate agent at Brown Harris Stevens in the Hamptons on Long Island's East End. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales across the country decreased for a fourth straight month in May, according to the National Association of Realtors. In June, the number of new listings hitting the market nationwide grew 11% from May and 5.5% compared with the same month of last year, according to the Realtor.com Monthly Housing Report. And while total active inventory is down 43% from the same period of last year, that is an improvement from a 60% difference in May, said Realtor.com Senior <span class="companylink">Economist</span> 
                     George Ratiu. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We all felt, 60 days ago, that we were literally going to run out of inventory," said real-estate agent Jonathan Boxer of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> in Aspen, Colo. "And then things shifted. We started bringing on some new sellers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price growth has slowed with more listings hitting the market across the country, Mr. Ratiu said. In June, the median listing price increased 12.7% year-over-year, compared with a jump of 17.2% in April. He said he expects growth to continue slowing over the next year. Overall, said Mr. Ratiu, "I see this current market beginning to look a lot more like a normal market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, Brooklyn residents Michelle and Dan Mannix thought they would never sell their country home in Orient village on Long Island's North Fork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We used it the whole pandemic and it was a godsend," Ms. Mannix said of the house, which the couple, who are serial entrepreneurs, purchased 14 years ago for weekends and vacations. When the pandemic broke out, they moved to Orient full time with their son. "I would say, 'We're never going to sell.' Then all of a sudden, things started to shift."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They watched in awe as home prices on the North Fork shot up. A house a few blocks from theirs sold in 72 hours for $2.5 million, "much more money than anybody had seen recently," said Ms. Mannix, 50. "That was like, 'Well, wow. What could you get for ours?' That got our wheels spinning."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, who moved back to Brooklyn in October, decided to put the Orient home on the market. They listed it in late May for $2.466 million with Lori Feilen of Town &amp; Country Real Estate. In mid-July, the Mannixes reduced the price to $2.196 million. There have been no offers yet, however, and Ms. Mannix said there is more competition than she expected, with new listings popping up after months when the tiny hamlet had virtually no homes for sale. "It felt like there was never anything, and now, since we put our house on the market, I've seen three or four really nice listings," she said. "For Orient, that's a lot."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 13 home listings on the market in Orient in late June, up 62.5% from the monthly average of eight listings the area saw over the past year, according to Realtor.com.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How has the residential real-estate market changed in your area in recent months? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While demand is still strong, some buyers' urgency has faded as they go on vacation, visit family or spend weekends at the beach rather than at open houses, said Chris Itteilag of <span class="companylink">Washington Fine Properties</span>, who represented Mr. Coleman in his purchase of a Potomac home. Others, fatigued by the high prices and competition, are taking a break from house-hunting. Very desirable properties still generate bidding wars, Mr. Itteilag said, but others sit on the market, especially if they are overpriced or need renovation. "It's more hit-or-miss, or property-specific," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Montgomery County, where Potomac is located, 1,855 new listings came on the market in May, a leap of 49% from May of 2020, according to <span class="companylink">Bright MLS</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, luxury properties are hitting the market in greater numbers than lower-priced homes, Mr. Ratiu said. The number of new listings over $1 million jumped 17.5% year-over-year in the week ended June 19, according to Realtor.com, while new listings priced under $350,000 were down 7.4%. The total inventory of homes for sale above $1 million was still down from last year by 23%, but the number of listings below $350,000 fell 49%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end listings are more abundant in part because the investors who have been scooping up single-family houses tend to purchase inexpensive homes to maximize returns, Mr. Ratiu said. Another factor is that some sellers are overpricing their homes—a phenomenon he referred to as "a make-me-move price"—but buyers are wary of paying too much, unlike earlier in the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many sellers, it simply wasn't practical to list their homes during the early pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the case for Ms. Ackerman's clients Robert Kushner and Trevor Yoder. The couple have owned their barn-style Hamptons home for 20 years, sometimes living there full time and sometimes using it as a weekend escape from their apartment in Manhattan. "We've had big Thanksgivings in this house for years," said Mr. Kushner, 56.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the couple are now developing a hospitality and residential project in Costa Rica, where Mr. Yoder lives for months at a time. They had been planning to sell the East Hampton property and relocate to Costa Rica, but the pandemic made it difficult to complete the renovations they wanted to do before listing the house. "When people are buying or renting out here, they expect things to look as good as when they're brand new," said Mr. Kushner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than sell it, they rented the property. Then, as Covid restrictions began to ease, they did the renovations as quickly as possible, redoing the floors and repainting. They put the house on the market for sale on June 14 for $7.25 million, as well as for rent asking $195,000 for the month of August. The rent has since been lowered to $150,000. Mr. Kushner says they won't sell unless they are happy with the price. "We want to see what the market can bear right now," he said. "If it sells, great. If it rents, we're fine with that as well."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Harvey is the London-based partner and head of international residential sales at Knight Frank. An earlier version of this article incorrectly gave his name as Mark Knight. (July 15, 2021)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathryn Gamble, a Chicago veterinarian, and her husband, Texas orchestra conductor Robert Carter Austin, have been frequent visitors to Venice[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/tourists-return-and-venice-wonders-how-many-are-too-many-11624812240] for more than two decades, staying in hotels or short-term rentals. They were ready to buy a home there in 2020, but Covid-19 intervened[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/as-coronavirus-infections-rise-in-europe-so-do-travel-restrictions-11602496801].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as trans-Atlantic travel for Americans tentatively resumes, they are restarting their search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the couple's most recent Venetian sojourn in 2018, they rented a palazzo on the Grand Canal, recalls Dr. Gamble. They hosted friends and family, and flew a Texas flag from the balcony. Looking ahead to ownership, they hope to recapture some of that atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to be on the water," says the 54-year-old. "And we need to have three or four bedrooms. It's Venice, and people will come to visit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Gamble and her husband, 75, recently made inquiries about a nine-bedroom, 17th-century Grand Canal palazzo, which turned out to be listed for $11.2 million, according to Knight Frank, which is handling the sale. On the other side of the canal, a six-bedroom, 3,800-square-foot apartment in an early-20th-century building is listed for $2.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Lisbon to the Greek islands, the Americans are back, ready to take advantage of the buyer's market in many of Europe's leading resort areas. There are bargains to be had[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/coronavirus-has-hit-some-european-real-estate-markets-harder-than-others-11588867281] at the entry and mid-levels, with prices buoyant at the top end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In mid-June, the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> 
                     reopened nonessential travel from the U.S.[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/americans-welcomed-back-to-europe-as-covid-19-restrictions-ease-11623853296], prompting a jump in property inquires, says Mark Harvey, a London-based partner and head of international residential sales at the U.K.'s Knight Frank. He says the latest wave of house hunters are especially interested in vacation homes in Italy and France, and he also has seen more calls about Lisbon. At <span class="companylink">Savills</span>, another U.K. real-estate company, inquiries from Americans have doubled compared with this time last year, says Hugo Thistlethwayte, head of global residential operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knight Frank last week released its Global Residential Cities Index for the first quarter of 2021, giving a view of price changes from the year-earlier period, when lockdowns began to take hold world-wide. It shows double-digit increases clustered in the Nordic countries and Eastern Europe, while prime European second-home destinations that had been inching toward the top in previous years—including Lisbon and Malaga on Spain's Costa del Sol—are seeing declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Venice, real-estate prices are down by 4.3% over the past year, Knight Frank shows. "It's not like it was before," says Giovanni Rubin de Cervin Albrizzi, a local architect. "But recently, there have been lots of French and Germans, and the Americans are starting to come just now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rubin, who specializes in renovations of historic properties, says the pandemic changed his business. Instead of full-scale renovations of second homes, he is doing more partial projects on long-term rentals, where such work is done by renters in exchange for discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Alexopulos, another Texan, is looking in Marbella. Overall prices in the Spanish coastal resort fell 10.3% from spring 2020 to 2021, says Andrea de la Hoz, senior analyst at Tinsa, a Spanish real-estate consulting firm. Mr. Alexopulos says his interest was piqued by a three-bedroom Marbella apartment listed at $515,000, down from the $770,000 the owner had paid a few years ago. He attributes the fall to the drop in vacation rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the luxury end, however, purchases have surged to a level not seen before, says Christopher Clover of Panorama Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He currently is selling a five bedroom, 13,364-square-foot villa in La Zagaleta, a gated Marbella-area mountain development, for $19.9 million. Earlier, a 33,500-square-foot villa on 3.4 acres in the same development, listed for $37.9 million, sold after two years on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans, known for favoring traditional properties, now are in line in Marbella with international preferences toward new construction, says Mr. Clover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Alexopulos, 68, and his wife, Janet Ferrari, 55, who co-own backyard-game manufacturer Free Donkey Sports, say they see Europe as offering a better return on a second home for themselves and their London-based son. "The prices in the U.S. are crazy[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-rose-to-record-in-april-11624972608] right now," says Mr. Alexopulos. They recently sold an Orlando, Fla., property they owned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans typically play a niche role in Southern Europe's luxury second-home markets, which tend to be dominated by sun-hungry Northern Europeans. But they have traditionally made themselves more conspicuous at the very top of those markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Knight Frank study on French markets shows Riviera prices are static at 1% increase during 2020, but they still are the country's highest. Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, a tiny peninsula near Nice, has the country's most expensive real estate at $3,855 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In search of quieter or more authentic options, Americans looking in the area seem most interested in the so-called backcountry listings, such as a six-bedroom stone farmhouse, dating to the 18th century, a 40-minute drive from Antibes. The 2.2-acre property has an asking price of $7.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans should expect evolving rules for travel and viewings across Europe. Mr. Alexopulos says he and his wife—both fully vaccinated—are preparing for their trip by monitoring <span class="companylink">U.S. State Department</span> information on Spain, as well as the Spanish health website. They also stay in touch with their airline.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you thinking of buying a home outside the U.S.? If so, where? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Lisbon, now a major tourist destination and second-home market, prices fell 3.8% from the first quarter of 2020 to the 2021 period, according to Knight Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newer arrivals include those in Lisbon's growing high-tech scene, says Lindsey Elkin, co-founder of Yayem, a members club and digital platform based in greater Lisbon. Ms. Elkin, 31, a Philadelphia native, says American tech-industry expats are looking for homes in Lapa and Santos, historic districts with river views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vitor Almeida, a Portuguese architect with a high-end residential practice that caters to expatriates, says the pandemic brought delays to renovations but no added expenses. Last year, he completed a $1.1 million renovation of a 3,500-square-foot unit in Lisbon for Cinara Ruiz, a Brazilian entrepreneur who divides her time between Portugal and Brazil. Work included restoring the apartment's original frescoes and adding two full baths and three half-baths to what had once been a one-bathroom home for a single family. Mrs. Ruiz, 53, bought the property for $3 million in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans also are showing renewed interest in Greece, one of the first European countries to welcome them back this year[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/americans-can-travel-to-greece-now-heres-how-to-smooth-the-way-11625848440]. According to Greece Sotheby's International Realty, U.S. inquiries were up by 60% this spring, compared with spring 2020. Francis Michael Prantounas, sales director of Engel &amp; Völkers Greece, says luxury prices are strong on the islands of Santorini and Mykonos, and bargains are found on Paros, an island south of Mykonos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Mykonos—which has gone from a hippie redoubt to a gay mecca to an exclusive vacation enclave—have jumped nearly 5% over last year, says an analysis from Engel &amp; Völkers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vana Verouti, a 70-year-old Greek singer and interior designer, bought an empty lot on the island's southeast tip in 1995 and built a 3,800-square-foot villa with her now-deceased husband. Ms. Verouti—who divides her time between Athens, Mykonos and a home in Switzerland—has put her 1.7-acre property on the market for $3.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mykonos competes with the island of Corfu for Greece's most expensive vacation homes, says Savvas Savvaidis, of Greece Sotheby's International Realty. He says Americans make up about 10% of Greece's luxury market. Mykonos's most expensive properties, he adds, tend to be on the west side, to take advantage of dramatic sunsets and easy access to Mykonos Town, as the island's largest settlement is known.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some key numbers have been moving in the wrong direction for mortgage stocks, even as home prices surge[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-rose-to-record-in-april-11624972608]. But investors shouldn't slam the door shut quite yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, mortgage-application activity in the U.S. was at its lowest level since January last year, according to data from the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>. That is despite the fact that the benchmark mortgage rate was about 0.11 percentage point lower than in the same week a year ago. Many who would be inclined to refinance have already done so at even lower rates[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/rising-rates-damp-mortgage-applications-ahead-of-spring-selling-season-11614168007], the MBA said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More notable is that purchase applications in the MBA index are also trending lower right now. Analysts have widely suggested that sharply higher home prices might be discouraging some buyers. The MBA has also noted the lack of availability[https://www.mba.org/2021-press-releases/june/mortgage-applications-decrease-in-latest-mba-weekly-survey-x281049] of entry-level homes squeezing out first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher home prices do make for larger loans, which can generate more revenue for originators. But volume and spreads[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/mortgage-lenders-need-to-pump-up-the-volume-11620754005] are the big keys to the business of selling loans[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/how-american-mortgage-machine-works-11609675200]. So in a double whammy, expectations for the profitability on loan sales are falling too: Nearly 70% of mortgage executives surveyed[https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/surveys/mortgage-lender-sentiment-survey] by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> in the second quarter expect profit margins to decline in the three months ahead. Both market prices and competition play a role in that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bigger picture doesn't look quite so grim, though. Rates have continued to trend lower this week; the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasurys is now at its lowest level since February. More buyers might eventually capitulate to higher prices, as strong wage growth paired with historically low rates make monthly payments relatively affordable. Only 32% of consumers in the most recent survey by Fannie said they think now is a good time to buy a home—a record low—but many are still intent on making their next move a purchase, driven partly by demographic factors such as millennial household formation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     More supply[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-market-is-nearly-4-million-homes-short-of-buyer-demand-11618484400] could soon come online as developers finish projects. And 77% of consumers in the recent Fannie survey said now is a good time to sell[https://www.fanniemae.com/newsroom/fannie-mae-news/consumers-increasingly-adamant-its-good-time-sell-bad-time-buy-home]. The Biden administration is likely to put in place[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/biden-seeks-to-ease-housing-shortage-with-looser-zoning-rules-11617796817] policies to widen access to homeownership, perhaps partly through its regulation[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fannie-and-freddie-overhaul-reboot-benefits-many-mortgage-players-11624878180] of Fannie and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">UWM Holdings</span> has guided toward higher volume in the second quarter than the first as purchase loans[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/mortgage-investors-look-back-to-the-future-11613397600], a strength of the brokers it partners with, become a bigger part of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spread between primary mortgage rates and the rates on packages of loans sold to bond investors is a key proxy for future loan-sale margins. It has come down since its peak last year, but it remains about 25% above long-term historical averages and stabilized in the second quarter, according to figures tracked by analysts at Autonomous Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage originators Rocket and <span class="companylink">UWM</span>, which have both listed in the past year, are both down more than 10% over the past five months. Relative to estimated earnings in 2022, when the mortgage market should be on a more normalized trajectory, they now trade at price-to-earnings ratios of about 12 and 9.5 times, respectively, according to FactSet. That compares with ratios of over 13.5 and 11.5 last month. That reflects investors' concerns, but creates an opportunity for anyone wagering on a better-than-expected housing market or economy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good day. Scaling back the Federal Reserve's $120 billion a month in bond buying will help reduce the risk of excessive risk taking, notably in the housing market, and give the U.S. central bank more policy options, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said Wednesday. "If we take our foot off the accelerator gently now, we'll have more flexibility down the road to avoid more abrupt action," Mr. Kaplan said in a television interview. The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index rose 8% in May from April, another sign of hot housing demand. Looking to today's data, economists surveyed by WSJ estimate that new jobless claims resumed their decline in the week ended June 26.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices surged at their fastest pace ever in April as buyers competing for a limited number of homes on the market pushed the booming housing market to new records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 14.6% in the year that ended in April, up from an 13.3% annual rate the prior month. April marked the highest annual rate of price growth since the index began in 1987.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have surged this year because of low mortgage-interest rates, which have spurred strong demand, and a continued shortage of homes for sale. Many homes are getting multiple offers and selling above asking price. The home-price surge is widespread around the U.S., affecting buyers and sellers in big cities, suburbs and small towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median existing-home sales price in May rose almost 24% from a year earlier, topping $350,000 for the first time, the National Association of Realtors said earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have started to decline in recent months, because there aren't enough houses on the market for all the buyers looking to buy. Rising prices have also deterred buyers, and many builders are capping sales to manage their costs and production pace. Some economists expect the pace of home-price growth to slow as well by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But real-estate agents say in many areas, the market is so frenzied that a slight slowdown in activity wouldn't make a big difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been crazy within the last year," said Scott Chase, chief operating officer at Intero Real Estate Services, who is based in Los Altos, Calif. "My thinking is, is this going to slow down with people being vaccinated and wanting to go on vacation? [But] it is still incredibly active."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the national pace of price gains is now faster than during the housing boom in the early 2000s, this market is less prone to a downturn, economists say. Ultralow mortgage interest rates mean that the typical home buyer's monthly payment hasn't risen as rapidly as the typical house price. Lending standards are also stricter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But fast-rising home prices and the limited inventory are making homeownership less attainable for first-time buyers or those with limited budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Affordability is worsening," said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American Financial Corp. "That's what will eventually cause house prices to not continue to accelerate and then eventually begin to slow down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some workers may also decide to hold off on moving until they know their companies' plans for returning to the office. The rise in remote work during the pandemic spurred many households to move farther from their offices.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Fed Officials Debate Scaling Back Mortgage-Bond Purchases at Faster Clip; Soaring home prices lead some officials to call for the central bank to stop buying mortgage bonds sooner than Treasury bonds</span>
</div><div class="author">By Paul Kiernan </div><div>1091 words</div><div>28 June 2021</div><div>05:33</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—As <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials discuss how to eventually scale back their easy-money policies, they are debating whether to start by reducing purchases of mortgage-backed securities to avoid adding more fuel to the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has bought $982 billion of the mortgage bonds since March 5, 2020, and currently plans to keep buying at least $40 billion each month. Those purchases, along with the Fed's monthly purchases of $80 billion of Treasury debt, aim to hold down long-term borrowing costs to stimulate the economy as it recovers from the effects of the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials at their June 15-16 policy meeting reaffirmed plans to continue holding short-term interest rates near zero and continue the asset purchases for some time. They also began discussing[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/federal-reserve-meeting-interest-rates-bond-purchases-june-2021-11623777582] when and how to begin reducing, or tapering, asset purchases as an initial step toward weaning the economy off such support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One option suggested at the meeting was to start scaling back the mortgage-bond purchases earlier or more quickly than the Treasury debt purchases, officials said. Call it a two-speed taper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are some unintended consequences and side effects of these purchases that we are seeing play out," Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said in an interview, referring to the mortgage-bond purchases, which he thinks are contributing to skyrocketing home prices. He had said previously that he was questioning whether the purchases are still needed. "I've shared my views" at the policy meeting, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, in a June 18 CNBC interview, said, "I'm leaning a little bit toward the idea[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/feds-bullard-pencils-in-rate-increase-in-2022-questions-mortgage-bond-buying-11624022857] that maybe we don't need to be in mortgage-backed securities with a booming housing market and even a threatening housing bubble here, according to some people."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the central bank stop buying mortgage-backed securities? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren 
                     suggested on May 5[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ1BoIQ8RPY&amp;t=838s] that Fed officials should think about a two-speed taper. "The mortgage market probably doesn't need as much support now," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Fed officials argue against the idea, saying the combined purchases of mortgage and Treasury securities lower long-term interest rates overall—not just mortgage rates. They say other factors are contributing to the hot housing market, including a dearth of homes for sale relative to strong demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They view the mortgage-bond purchases as they do the Treasury purchases—as a way to push down long-term rates throughout the economy by buying long-term securities, which pushes up their prices. Bond prices and yields move inversely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage bond buys are "not really directly affecting the interest you pay on your mortgage," San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, told reporters Tuesday[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/feds-williams-says-bond-buying-isnt-designed-as-direct-housing-aid-11624374934]. "My best-guess estimate is that we are having a de minimis effect on mortgage interest rates with our mortgage-backed securities purchases." The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage[http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/index.html?intcmp=CWS-HP] has fallen to 3.02% as of last week from about 3.5% in February 2020, before the pandemic hit the U.S. economy, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed governor Lael Brainard 
                     said on June 1[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/brainard-says-fed-should-be-prepared-to-adjust-policy-if-needed-11622571211] that the monetary policy effect of the purchases of Treasurys and mortgage bonds "is roughly the same." She added, "so in that sense the [current] composition is effective," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York Fed President John Williams, said last month that the mortgage-bond purchases, "dollar for dollar, have pretty powerful spillovers into other financial conditions such as corporate bond rates and other kinds of similar securities." He reiterated this past week that the Fed's asset purchases aren't "specifically targeted to the housing market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kaplan and other advocates of a two-speed taper—including former White House economic adviser Jason Furman and former Treasury Secretary[https://twitter.com/LHSummers/status/1394313266126594048?s=20] 
                     Lawrence Summers—say the mortgage-bond purchases hold down mortgage rates, which are already low by historical standards. Lower rates allow home shoppers to raise their bids. And median home prices, up 24% in May from a year earlier, are already rising at the fastest pace in decades[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-prices-hit-record-high-in-may-11624371222].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We all would much rather have low mortgage rates. But house prices are exploding right now," Mr. Furman said June 9 on CNN. "It probably isn't the case that the Fed should be continuing to artificially hold mortgage rates down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hasn't publicly weighed in on the debate. But the last time Fed officials were preparing to pare back a bond-buying program, in 2013, Mr. Powell—then a governor but not chairman—initially favored tapering Treasurys "all the way to the ground" before starting to reduce the pace of mortgage-backed securities. That was because he sought to continue supporting the housing market, which was still struggling after the 2007-09 recession. "The reason is that this recovery is hugely about housing," he said at a policy meeting in October 2013, according to the transcript.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials, including Mr. Powell, ultimately decided to taper purchases of both Treasury and mortgage bonds at the same pace, in part because they worried it would be difficult to clearly communicate a more complicated, two-speed taper process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purpose of the Fed's asset purchases is to support the entire economy rather than a specific sector. Slowing the mortgage-bond buying before the Treasury purchases would undermine that rationale by tailoring it according to the condition of the housing sector. It would also suggest the Fed is using monetary policy to address a concern about the stability of the financial system arising from elevated home prices—something Fed officials have long been reluctant to do, said Roberto Perli, head of global policy at Cornerstone Macro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors, said he doubts that the Fed would cool off the housing market by buying fewer mortgage bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The only thing that's going to have a measurable impact on housing is pulling back on demand, for which you'd need the Fed to be raising longer-term rates…but the Fed's not ready to do that," Mr. Duy said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said Friday he is ready to debate pulling back on the U.S. central bank's support for the economy, in part over concerns that ultra easy credit could destabilize it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's certainly time to start thinking about how quickly is it appropriate to remove accommodation," Mr. Rosengren said, without offering a timetable or how he would prefer that to happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosengren, who is not currently a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, weighed in during a virtual appearance, just as many of his colleagues are actively debating whether the Fed should reduce its support for the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At last week's FOMC meeting, Fed officials moved forward their collective assessment of when the central bank could start raising interest rates. They also acknowledged they are thinking about slowing the pace of the Fed's $120 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage bond purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A stronger than expected economic recovery is driving the debate, which is also being influenced by higher than expected inflation readings, robust gains in asset markets, a red hot housing market and an improving job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key front in the debate over what will happen with the Fed's bond buying is the fate of its mortgage purchases. Some officials, like Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan, believe the housing market no longer needs the Fed's support. By contrast, <span class="companylink">San Francisco Fed</span> leader Mary Daly has said the mortgage purchases help make credit more available in a broad-based fashion and have only a modest impact on home borrowing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosengren expressed concern about excesses in financial markets and home buying in part tied to expectations that the Fed's very easy policy will remain in place for a long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do worry about froth in markets, and I do worry about individuals assuming that monetary policy is going to stay accommodative forever," he said, adding that "we have to look at some of the side effects to our policies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The run-up in housing prices may be one of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing prices in the United States have been going up quite quickly, and this is something that I think policy makers need to continue to monitor very closely, and think about what the ramifications would be if we create a boom and bust cycle this time around," Mr. Rosengren said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Boston Fed</span> chief didn't say the housing market is a bubble or that he expects a rapid decline in home prices, but he noted he is concerned that the rise in prices, in part tied to Fed policy, increases the chances the economy could run into trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosengren also said he expects the current inflation surge to ebb into next year, and that while the job market still has a way to go to full health, it is moving quickly in that direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, Mr. Rosengren reiterated his view that money-market funds remain a risk factor for the economy and financial system, and expressed concern about so-called stablecoins, private digital money that aims to offer the stability of government money, unlike most cryptocurrencies that have proven to be volatile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are many reasons to think many of the stablecoins actually aren't very stable" and could be the source of a future financial crisis if the risks they pose aren't addressed, Mr. Rosengren said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Numbers Ain't What They Used to Be in Turbulent U.S. Economy; Durable goods, jobs and home sales have all wrong-footed economists who didn't count on big revisions lately</span>
</div><div class="author">By Justin Lahart </div><div>455 words</div><div>24 June 2021</div><div>14:06</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a rule of thumb in data watching that, if you want to understand which way things are trending, you need to watch the revisions. What is happening with capital spending might be a case in point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department on Thursday reported that U.S. manufacturers' new orders for durable goods rose 2.3% in May from April[https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/manufacturing/m3/adv/pdf/durgd.pdf], lower than the 2.6% gain economists expected. Much of that increase was due to a jump in aircraft orders, which are often lumpy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The element of the report economists home in on to gauge capital spending plans—nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft—slipped 0.1%. Most had expected it to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then there were significant revisions to the April durable-goods figures, which now show that orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose 2.7% in April from March, versus an initially reported gain of 2.2%. That marked the largest monthly increase since July of last year, when the U.S. economy was still lurching out of the spring shutdowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revised data tend to provide a more complete picture of what is happening. When the Labor Department releases its monthly jobs figures, for example, it has data from about three-quarters of the employers[https://www-bls-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/web/empsit/cesregrec.htm]it has surveyed. Over the next two months that response rate is usually over 90%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the businesses that respond early to a survey face the same conditions as the ones that respond late, then the data revisions should be minor, but that often isn't the case. Bigger companies can often send responses sooner, for example, and businesses in some industries tend to respond quicker and can be dealing with a very different set of circumstances than others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those differences might be particularly pronounced now as the economy digests surging demand, shifts in consumer preferences and supply-chain bottlenecks[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/supply-chain-bottlenecks-drive-factory-decisions-at-this-maker-of-boats-motorcycles-atvs-11624111201] brought on by the easing of the Covid-19 crisis. It might well be the case that, once it has more complete data in hand, the Commerce Department ends up revising its capital-goods orders figures higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revisions can cut both ways, of course. When the Commerce Department reported May new-home sales[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/how-home-builders-are-contributing-to-housing-frenzy-11624468037]on Wednesday,it revised its April figures[https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf]significantly lower, and the same went for March sales figures. Maybe the May data is going to get knocked down, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an unusual economic environment, first impressions can be misleading.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>865 words</div><div>23 June 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices in May posted their biggest annual increase in more than two decades, as a shortage of properties and low borrowing rates fueled demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median existing-home sales price in May topped $350,000 for the first time, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. The figure was nearly 24% higher than a year ago, the biggest year-over-year price increase the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> has recorded in data going back to 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales prices have been climbing sharply since last summer, when lockdowns related to the Covid-19 pandemic eased across the country and many people rushed to find more space and bigger homes. Others working remotely seized on the chance to move to a less expensive city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price increase is contributing to a slowdown in the pace of home sales. Existing-home sales fell 0.9% in May from April, marking the fourth straight month of declining sales, the Realtors group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales are also slipping because there aren't enough homes on the market to meet demand, economists and real-estate agents said. Homes that are for sale are moving quickly. The typical home that sold in May spent 17 days on the market, matching the record low reached in April, the Realtors group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers with limited cash for down payments are struggling the most to compete. Just over half of existing-home buyers in May who used mortgages put at least 20% down, according to a <span class="companylink">NAR</span> survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Affordability appears to be now squeezing away some buyers," said Lawrence Yun, the Realtors group's chief economist. "There are so many people who have been outbid, frustrated they are unable to buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jake and Belen Markham, who live in Gilbert, Ariz., are among those who have opted out of the current market. The couple put in two unsuccessful offers on houses this spring before deciding to find a rental apartment instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We started realizing that . . . we couldn't get what we wanted, pretty much, with the prices how they were," Mr. Markham said. "Our best bet is to keep saving up money, so that we can be a little bit more of a player in this market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications for home purchases have slowed this spring, another sign that a number of buyers are holding off. Applications fell 17% from a year earlier in the week ended June 11, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 35% of consumers surveyed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> in May said it was a good time to buy a home, a record low in data going back to 2010. "From our perspective, it's almost all driven by the attitudes about price," said Doug Duncan, chief economist for Fannie Mae.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even with some buyers in retreat, the housing market remains hot by most other measures. Homes are getting multiple offers, and low mortgage rates keep fueling demand. More than half of homes sold above their list price in May, according to real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Rubin and Matthew Snyder lost out on 11 offers before having one accepted for a four-bedroom house in Shoreline, Wash. The couple was living in a one-bedroom apartment with their 3-year-old daughter and in a rush to buy a house because their second child is due in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were competing with people that were willing to put $250,000 on top of the asking price," Ms. Rubin said. "It was really stressful and emotionally draining to constantly be rejected from offer after offer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family moved into their new home last month. "I feel really fortunate to be able to afford to buy a home. I honestly didn't think that it was in our future," Ms. Rubin said. "We did save as much as we could when we could, but still it never felt like enough."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street has been looking for more exposure to the U.S. housing market by buying up homes and renting them out. In the most recent move, <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group Inc</span>. said Tuesday it agreed to pay $6 billion for Home Partners of America Inc., which owns more than 17,000 houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are trying to crank out more supply to meet the booming demand. Housing starts, a measure of U.S. home building, rose 3.6% in May from April, the Commerce Department said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are limited, however, by land supply and construction costs, and the supply imbalance shows no near-term sign of meaningfully easing. Residential permits, which can be a bellwether for construction, fell 3% in May from April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hot market is especially tough on first-time and lower-income buyers, but home sales have been strong at the top end. The number of homes selling that were priced over $1 million more than doubled in May compared with a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                        <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group Inc</span>. has agreed to buy a company that buys and rents single-family homes in a $6 billion deal, a sign Wall Street believes the U.S. housing market is going to stay hot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment firm confirmed Tuesday that it has reached a deal to acquire Home Partners of America Inc., which owns more than 17,000 houses throughout the U.S. Home Partners buys homes, rents them out and offers its tenants the chance to eventually buy. The deal had been reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales soared last year at their fastest pace in 14 years, when low mortgage rates and the rise of remote work during the pandemic sent buyers scrambling to find larger living spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of homes for sale relative to demand and record housing prices have slowed the pace of home sales in recent months. But on a historic basis, the market remains red hot, and analysts say demand from millennials entering their prime homebuying years is expected to fuel demand for years to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for existing homes topped $350,000 for the first time in May, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. "That supply-demand imbalance will not be fixed overnight," said Kathleen McCarthy, global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> was among the big investment firms to buy houses in bulk in the aftermath of the subprime crisis, when lenders sold off foreclosed homes at marked-down prices. The New York firm built a portfolio of tens of thousands of single-family homes, then rented them out through a company called <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2019, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> exited from the single-family rental business when it sold its last shares in <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span>, which had become the largest U.S. firm in this industry with 80,000 homes for lease. The firm put its toe back in the market in 2020 by investing $240 million to buy a preferred equity stake in Toronto's <span class="companylink">Tricon Residential Inc</span>., which buys single-family rentals in North America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s deal for Chicago-based Home Partners shows that the investment firm is turning even more bullish on U.S. housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm is rejoining an expanding roster of Wall Street powerhouses that have acquired single-family rental companies. Canadian property giant <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management Inc</span>. recently acquired a stake in a landlord that owns more than 10,000 U.S. homes. J.P. Morgan Asset Management and Rockpoint Group LLC also have made big investments in single-family rental operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business is attractive to investors because growth can come from both rising home prices and rent increases. The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 13.2% in the year that ended in March, up from a 12% annual rate the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental market showed signs of softness during the pandemic, especially in downtowns that saw an exodus of residents. But lately rents, too, have begun to rise. Median asking rents rose 1.1% annually in March to $1,463 a month across the country's 50 largest markets, according to Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many analysts say that with home-price gains showing little sign of easing, rents can keep growing throughout the U.S. as would-be home buyers are priced out of the market and are compelled to keep renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all their recent activity, big institutional investors own about 300,000 U.S. homes, or only 2% of single-family rental homes, according to a report by New York-based financial firm Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC. About 85% of the single-family rental market is owned by investors with 10 or fewer properties, the firm said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Partners, founded in 2012, has a different business model from <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span> and some of the other big firms in the single-family rental business. It gives renters the option to buy at a predetermined price at any time with 30 days' notice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, Home Partners limits its acquisition of houses to those homes identified by people as ones they would possibly like to buy after renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McCarthy said about 20% of Home Partners' renters have ended up exercising their options to buy their homes. She said she expects that rate to increase because, given recent home-price appreciation, many Home Partners renters buying today would likely be paying a price below current market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> is buying Home Partners through an investment fund named Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, which primarily raises money from small investors and tends to hold assets longer than the firm's opportunistic funds. That strategy is a sign that <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> thinks the housing market rally could last many years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Partners chose <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s all-cash offer after a competitive bidding process, according to <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>. The deal is expected to close later this year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman and Ben Eisen </div><div>968 words</div><div>21 June 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surging prices in the turbocharged housing market are sidelining many would-be buyers, with those who can't afford big down payments often losing out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half of existing-home buyers in April who used mortgages put at least 20% down, according to a National Association of Realtors survey. In 10 years of record-keeping, that percentage has hit or exceeded 50% three times, and all have been since last fall. A quarter of existing-home buyers in April paid cash, the highest level since 2017, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oscar Reyes Santana has been house hunting with his parents and siblings for more than a year in California's San Fernando Valley. They are all first-time buyers and budgeted for a 5% down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family bid on at least five homes, each time offering at least $30,000 above the asking price, but they lost out every time, said Mr. Reyes Santana, who is 23 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been really tough to try to beat everyone else," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have all but given up the search for now, and are focused on saving up for a bigger down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are surging. The median existing-home price rose 19% from a year earlier to $341,600 in April, a record high, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>. That is largely because there aren't enough homes on the market to meet demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In such a housing market, sellers can often choose among multiple offers. Cash buyers have an advantage because they don't need to secure mortgages, which can make the transaction go faster. Sellers sometimes worry that offers with smaller down payments are likelier to fall through during the loan-closing process, agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many borrowers who can afford only small upfront costs get loans insured by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> or the Department of Veterans Affairs. In an April <span class="companylink">NAR</span> survey of real-estate agents, 27% said sellers were unlikely to accept an offer with an <span class="companylink">FHA</span> or VA loan, and another 6% said sellers would refuse such an offer. These loans are less attractive to sellers because they have stricter closing conditions, real-estate agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While mortgage originations of all types rose last year as home buying surged, <span class="companylink">FHA</span> and VA loans lost market share to conventional loans. <span class="companylink">FHA</span> loans, which often go to first-time buyers, accounted for 10% of home purchases in the first quarter of 2021, the second-lowest level since 2008, according to Attom Data Solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's very hard to get my <span class="companylink">FHA</span> offers accepted," said Olivia Chavez Serrano, a real-estate agent in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bigger down payments can cushion the housing market in a downturn. In the 2007-09 recession, home buyers who had made tiny down payments were quickly underwater as soon as home prices started to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lump sum of 20% or more can be hard to come up with as home prices skyrocket, especially without help from family members. "I'd say at least 50% of my first-time home buyers are getting gifts right now," said Chris Borg, a mortgage broker at Vantage Mortgage Group Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low-down-payment loans and down-payment assistance programs are touted by affordable-housing advocates as crucial tools for increasing the homeownership rate, particularly for minority buyers. In 2019, a higher proportion of <span class="companylink">FHA</span> and VA borrowers were Black or Hispanic compared with conventional-loan borrowers, according to the Urban Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surging home prices are also complicating appraisals, which means some buyers are being forced to shell out more cash than they had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisals are based partly on recent sale prices for comparable homes in the area. When housing prices rise quickly, appraisal values don't always keep up. Mortgage lenders will typically lend only enough to cover the appraised value of a home, so when an appraisal comes in low, the buyer has to make up the difference or let the deal fall through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, a buyer who plans to put 20% down on a $500,000 purchase expects to pay $100,000. But if the home is appraised at $450,000, the cash payment goes up to $140,000 -- the sum of the $50,000 shortfall plus a $90,000 down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many buyers are still getting offers accepted without putting 20% down. First-time home buyers who used mortgages paid 9.1% down on average year-to-date through mid-May, though that is up from 8.4% for all of 2020, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. Repeat buyers paid 16.6% down on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Briana Stansbury, who works at a community college in Portland, Ore., recently made an offer on a two-bedroom house. She used a 5%-down loan program that <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> offers for first-time buyers, and she agreed to go through with the purchase even if the appraisal came in as much as $10,000 below her purchase price of $371,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That put Ms. Stansbury at risk of having to come up with extra cash in a hurry. She lost sleep while she waited for the appraisal. But it came back above the sale price, and she closed on the house in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Danyell Allen of Cedar Park, Texas, felt ready to buy a house this year. She had saved up for a 5% down payment. Her children wanted to paint their walls and adopt a pet, which they can't do in their rental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after losing out on more than 10 offers, she called off the search. "The lowest I heard I was beat out on any home was $30,000 over asking price," she said. "That's not something I can do."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. existing-home sales fell in April[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-dropped-17-8-in-april-11590070343] from the prior month as record-high prices deterred potential buyers. But April sales remained 51.7% higher than the same month a year before. Economists expect another decline in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's leading measure of business confidence, compiled by the Ifo research institute, is expected to record another pickup in optimism in June. That would underpin expectations that Europe's largest economy has rebounded in the second quarter from a first-quarter contraction and is set for even more rapid growth in the three months through September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. orders for long-last manufactured goods slipped in April[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-05-27-2021-11622068894] for the first time in a year, in part due to auto-industry backlogs caused by the global computer-chip shortage.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With consumer prices rising sharply, central bankers are having to work hard to resist the temptation to lift interest rates. A real-estate boom could make the job even tougher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monetary policy is already being tightened[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/red-hot-u-s-economy-drives-global-inflation-forcing-foreign-banks-to-act-11623933343?mod=hp_lead_pos4]. So far in 2021, there have been eight rate cuts and 19 increases, the latter by central banks in Russia, Brazil and Turkey among others, data by <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> shows. The anticipation of pandemic-era monetary stimulus coming to an end in rich nations too is weighing on investor sentiment. Stocks have taken a hit[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/global-stock-markets-dow-update-06-18-2021-11624002788?mod=markets_lead_pos1] since <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials released projections Wednesday showing that rates could go up in 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, on Thursday, <span class="companylink">Norway's central bank</span> 
                     all but guaranteed[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/norges-bank-expects-to-raise-policy-rate-in-september-11623920689?mod=article_relatedinline] it will increase borrowing costs in September, placing it far ahead of the Fed and even the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of New Zealand</span>, which was the first to spook markets back in March. Developed countries have a lot more leeway to leave rates low than emerging ones, because they suffer far less from volatility in commodity prices and the U.S. dollar. But the <span class="companylink">Norges Bank</span> said in a statement that it "placed weight on the marked rise in house prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential property markets around the world are rallying. Norway's looked frothy far before the pandemic and home prices have risen 12% from January 2020. In the U.S., the U.K. and Germany, prices are up 15%, 13% and 16%, respectively. In China, property is once again[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/meet-the-new-chinese-economy-same-as-the-old-chinese-economy-11623843034] emerging as a key driver of economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To what extent do you think central banks around the world will begin to raise interest rates? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, central banks set rates based on inflation and, in the Fed's case, unemployment. After the 2008 mortgage crisis, however, officials in many countries started taking financial imbalances into account as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many in Wall Street also are pointing out that rising house prices could make today's higher inflation less temporary than assumed, by making households more spendthrift and pushing up shelter costs. The latter's weight in consumer baskets is so large that a small increase already made it a top contributor to May inflation in the U.S., the U.K. and the eurozone, after excluding commodity-related items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than helping investors prepare, though, these arguments risk pushing central bankers to make a mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, shelter costs remain subdued relative to 2019 trends. Some analysts counter that imputed rents—the theoretical rent that statisticians attribute to owner-occupiers—simply track market rents and don't show the true housing costs that result from rising property prices. But it is rents, not house prices, that reflect what people are willing to pay to live somewhere, just as earnings are the gauge of a company's profitability, not its stock price. Asset valuations can move up and down for other reasons. In this case, they are likely reacting to low interest rates, which have also pushed mortgage costs down over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if markets have benefited from low rates, officials aren't usually tempted to raise them just to torpedo stocks. The same should be true for real estate: Concerns shouldn't revolve about house prices themselves, but about households taking on too much debt, which can be better addressed with "macroprudential policies" such as regulation and extra capital constraints on banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors, a lot hangs on rate setters being able to keep a cool head as economic data rebounds. Norway's precedent could be a dangerous one.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>861 words</div><div>16 June 2021</div><div>09:26</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new housing in the past 20 years fell 5.5 million units short of long-term historical levels, according to a new National Association of Realtors report, which is calling for a "once-in-a-generation" policy response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry lobbying group said it hopes the report, which was released Wednesday, persuades lawmakers to include housing investments in any infrastructure package[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/biden-seeks-to-ease-housing-shortage-with-looser-zoning-rules-11617796817].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. builders added 1.225 million new housing units, on average, each year from 2001 to 2020, according to the report, which was prepared for <span class="companylink">NAR</span> by Rosen Consulting Group LLC. That figure is down from an annual average of 1.5 million new units from 1968 to 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have you tried to buy a house this year? How was your experience? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 5.5 million-unit deficit includes about two million single-family homes, 1.1 million units in buildings with two to four units and 2.4 million units in buildings of at least five units, the report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The scale of the problem is so large," said David Bank, senior vice president of Rosen Consulting Group and one of the report's authors. "We need affordable [housing], we need market-rate, we need single-family, we need multifamily."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also says that from 2010 to 2020, new-home construction fell 6.8 million units short of what was needed to meet household-formation growth and replace units that were aging or destroyed by natural disasters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Limited supply has been a recent driver of rising housing prices[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-accelerates-in-march-11621947742] for renters and home buyers, alongside robust demand. The median existing-home price rose 19% from a year earlier[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-prices-push-to-record-high-slowing-pace-of-purchases-11621605953] to $341,600 in April, a record high, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply shortage became especially acute in the past year. Builders slowed construction in some regions last spring and delayed land purchases[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-boom-brings-a-shortage-of-land-to-build-new-homes-11608904980] because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, low mortgage-interest rates and an increase in remote work led to a surge in demand for single-family housing. And many homeowners delayed or canceled plans to list their homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of existing homes on the market fell to 1.03 million units at the end of January, a record low in data going back to 1982, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>. The existing-home inventory totaled 1.16 million units at the end of April, a 20.5% decline from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing economists differ in their estimates of the supply-demand balance. In a study earlier this year, mortgage-finance company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> estimated that the national deficit of single-family homes stood at 3.8 million units[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-market-is-nearly-4-million-homes-short-of-buyer-demand-11618484400] at the end of 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry consultant John Burns said by his estimate, the U.S. has a deficit of fewer than a million homes. "Our adult population isn't growing as fast as it used to," said Mr. Burns, chief executive of John Burns Real Estate Consulting LLC. Compared with decades before 2000, "we don't need to build as much," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction surged in the early 2000s amid a housing boom. Then building activity slumped during the 2007-09 recession and stayed low for years as builders went out of business and workers left the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders ramped up the pace in 2020 in response to robust demand. Housing starts, a measure of home-building activity, rose last year to 1.38 million units, the highest rate since 2006. But shortages of labor, ready-to-build land and materials have limited the pace of construction growth, builders say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 90% of home builders surveyed by the National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span> in May reported shortages of appliances and framing lumber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To shrink the supply deficit, builders would need to exceed the long-term historical average pace of 1.5 million units a year, according to the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> report. At 2.1 million units a year, near the level reached in 2005, it would take a decade to close a gap of 5.5 million units, the report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">NAR</span> is calling for a suite of policy responses to increase housing supply, including expanding the tax credit program for low-income rental housing, encouraging renovation of distressed properties[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/bidens-neighborhood-revitalization-plan-looks-to-detroit-for-inspiration-11621935002] and offering incentives to cities and states to reduce regulatory limits on housing density. The association also supports converting commercial buildings for residential use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these ideas were included in President Biden's infrastructure proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expanding new-home construction to more than two million units a year for 10 years would create 2.8 million new jobs and generate more than $400 billion in economic activity, according to the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> report.</p>

                           NY Fed May Consumer Survey Finds Public Bracing for Large Inflation Gains; Consumers expect inflation to hit 4% one year from now, a series high for the New York Fed report</span>
</div><div class="author">By Michael S. Derby </div><div>707 words</div><div>14 June 2021</div><div>11:00</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2021, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans are bracing for a wave of higher inflation over the next year, amid projections of big increases in home prices, rent, food, gasoline and medical costs, the May New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations reported Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One year from now, the public expects inflation to hit 4%, a series high for the <span class="companylink">New York Fed</span> report, from the projected 3.4% increase reported in April. Three years from now, survey respondents said they expected to see inflation at 3.6%, the second highest reading for the survey, up from April's 3.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jump in inflation expectations came as respondents to the survey project major increases in home prices and for other things critical to daily life. One year from now, food and rent prices are expected to rise by 8% and 9.7%, respectively, both carving out series highs. Meanwhile, the expected rise in gasoline and medical care costs also increased, with both readings just short of 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are expected to rise by 6.2% a year from now, a series high, and up from April's 5.5% reading, the survey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">New York Fed</span> expected inflation readings arrived just as the Federal Reserve is scheduled to hold over Tuesday and Wednesday a pivotal meeting on monetary policy. Central bankers will gather as economic activity surges and the coronavirus pandemic abates. That has opened the door to an active debate as to whether it is time for central bankers to dial back the aggressive levels of stimulus they are now providing the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists do not expect the Fed to raise the near-zero percent short-term interest rate target that has been in place since March 2020, nor do they see central bankers dialing down what are now $120 billion a month in long-term bond purchases. But many do see central bankers starting a debate on whether to slow those purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate over dialing back stimulus is driven by many factors, but one of them is a looming fear that aggressive Fed aid coupled with historic levels of broader government support for the economy have raised the risk inflation could surge from years of moribund readings. Fed officials have argued for some time now they expect inflation to jump as the economy surges back to life but they also expect those pressures to subside as bottlenecks and other dislocations get worked out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some extent, the <span class="companylink">New York Fed</span> report tracks that outlook given that expected inflation a year from now is higher than the projected level of price increases three years from now. The <span class="companylink">New York Fed</span> also noted in the May report that those who reported the highest inflation expectations were those over 60, who presumably recall and were most scarred by the high inflation of the 1970s, and those with a high school education or less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials believe inflation expectations are critical because they believe that where inflation is expected to go exerts a powerful influence on where it is today. In recent comments, Fed officials have welcomed rising inflation expectations[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/derbys-take-powell-shrugs-off-rise-in-inflation-expectations-data-11619646396] as a sign their effort to get inflation sustainably back to 2% after years of weakness is working, and they have also said gains in expected inflation have returned to those levels seen in the early part of the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other surveys have also flagged a jump in expected inflation. University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey director Richard Curtin said in a report in late May he doesn't expect the public to move toward expectations of big and persistent inflation gains. But he added for the Fed, "early preventive actions are much less costly," adding that hinting at a rate increase "could easily douse an incipient inflationary psychology."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, market expectations of future inflation have been easing over recent days as bond yields have fallen, despite the government reporting[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/us-inflation-consumer-price-index-may-2021-11623288303] last week that consumer-level inflation in May booked its highest reading in 13 years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PENN HILLS, Pa.—Chuck Vukotich's yellow-brick Cape Cod is one of five houses that crowd around a cul-de-sac not quite large enough to make a U-turn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His parents bought the place in this working-class Pittsburgh suburb in 1961. He paid his mother $55,000 for it in 2016 to keep it in the family after she moved to a nursing home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house isn't for sale, but that isn't a problem for bargain-hunting real-estate speculators. They call Mr. Vukotich multiple times a week offering to buy it. They fill his mailbox with fliers teasing all-cash deals and quick closings. Mr. Vukotich guesses he has received more than 100 inquiries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't mind somebody trying to make a buck, but it's kind of a pain in the butt," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing boom that has sent prices soaring in such places as Austin, Texas, and Miami has come to Mr. Vukotich's nondescript neighborhood. Fevered buying has stretched beyond the vacation homes[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/vacation-home-buyers-propped-up-the-mortgage-market-now-they-face-a-test-11617269402] and upscale suburbs[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/connecticut-suburbs-coronavirus-new-york-real-estate-houses-for-sale-weston-fairfield-11594558882] that white-collar workers sought out during the pandemic year. Even small towns[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/real-estate-frenzy-overwhelms-small-town-america-i-came-home-crying-11621511972] and distant suburbs where homes routinely sell for less than $100,000[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-market-surge-is-making-the-cheapest-homes-the-hottest-11620811980] are abuzz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those places is Penn Hills. In this community 15 miles northeast of downtown Pittsburgh, the median sale price was up 19% in April from a year earlier, according to real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>., not much lower than the 22% rise nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price in Penn Hills was $132,000 in April compared with almost $371,000 nationally. In the Pittsburgh area, "You can still get a house for $50,000 that only needs cosmetic work and a roof," said Krystina Krysiak, a Redfin real-estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These prices are drawing a particular type of small-time investor who is looking to find good deals in a market that is short on supply[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-accelerates-in-march-11621947742] and long on demand[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-housing-market-is-crazier-than-its-been-since-2006-11617422403]. These buyers scour lead lists looking for inexpensive houses and trade tips on social media—much like their day-trading counterparts who are buying penny stocks[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/when-investors-forget-fundamentals-the-market-is-broken-11611055800] and betting on bitcoin[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-factors-driving-crypto-markets-boom-and-the-challenges-ahead-11621243809?mod=article_inline]. Some of the buyers flip the homes, and some rent them out. Some work with big-time investors for a cut of the proceeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vukotich guesses that investors started contacting him about two years ago, though outreach has picked up in the past year. A recent pitch arrived on a pink note card: "Could we possibly discuss making you a cash offer? Either way, please let me know. Blessings, Nick."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick Schindehette said he mails out between 5,000 and 20,000 of these cards each month to homeowners in 20 ZIP Codes. He got into the real-estate game after he attended a tutorial event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schindehette, 24 years old, targets what he says are "C+ neighborhoods," where homes are cheap but neighborhoods aren't falling apart. In Penn Hills, according to investors, it is possible to generate solid rental income or a tidy profit on a flip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vukotich's family moved to Penn Hills from nearby Wilkinsburg after he finished the sixth grade. They had lived in a duplex and wanted a stand-alone house. The one they bought has four bedrooms and 2½ bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vukotich and his friends would congregate at his place after school and throw around a football. His best friend lived down the street. The lady near the corner raised two boys who turned out to be famous hairstylists. Before his mother moved into the nursing home, the next-door neighbors would check on her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trees in the backyard were about Mr. Vukotich's height when his family arrived. Now they are big enough to shade the entire yard. On a recent sunny Friday afternoon, kids walked home from school and adults chatted outside. A Slip 'N Slide in a front yard beckoned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The neighborhood hasn't changed," he said. "It's a nice, quiet, working-class neighborhood."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vukotich doesn't live in the house anymore. Following his mother's wishes, he handed it over to his son, Charles, and daughter-in-law, Alexis Papalia, who currently live there. Mr. Vukotich's name is still on the deed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles grew up visiting his grandmother at the Penn Hills house. When he moved in, he pulled up the old carpeting and rolled his eyes when he found it covered in gold-flecked linoleum. He pulled that up too and found hardwood floors still in good condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He changed the light fixtures but left his grandmother's chandelier in the dining room. The house has its quirks, including book shelves on the second floor that open to reveal storage space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors often buy lists of homeowners from companies that scrape public data to find homes that fit their criteria. Mr. Schindehette said he found the elder Mr. Vukotich on three lists, including one of people who don't live in the homes they own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A successful response rate for his note cards would be 1%, Mr. Schindehette said. The people who sell to him often need to get rid of their homes quickly. The houses might need a lot of work. He said he has been involved in about 50 real-estate transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sometimes we're a good option for people," he said. "Sometimes we're not."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In such a sale, there is no real-estate agent and no open house. The investors rarely compete with families, and they usually buy at a discount. A rule of thumb popularized by real-estate websites such as BiggerPockets maintains that investors should never offer to buy[https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/70-percent-rule] a house for more than 70% of the after-repair value, minus the cost of repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Bell, who invests in real estate mostly in Pittsburgh's southern suburbs, said he recently picked up a three-bedroom, one-bathroom for $12,000. The family of the deceased owner might have fetched more in the open market, but they wanted to get rid of the property with minimal effort.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bell spent another $12,000 cleaning it out, painting and renovating the kitchen and bathroom himself. He figures it could sell for about $55,000 but decided to rent it for $875 a month. "I will have that paid off, if I sustain a tenant in there, in 2½ years," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers don't put their own skin into the game. They negotiate to buy the property on behalf of another investor and never take ownership. They are paid for finding the property by taking the difference between the seller's price and the buyer's price. This tactic, known as wholesaling, doesn't require capital to get started, so the barriers to entry are low. In some areas, wholesalers have been accused of cajoling poor homeowners into accepting lowball offers, prompting state and local governments[https://www.inquirer.com/news/real-estate-wholesalers-flippers-regulation-realtors-philadelphia-law-20201119.html] to crack down on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the pandemic wore on, local real-estate investors noticed that their ranks were swelling. That means more phone calls and mailers. For homeowners who do pick up the phone, it means more options. For investors, it can mean higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're sitting there with a stack of postcards, and they're like: 'If I don't like what I hear from you, I'm going to the next guy,'" Mr. Bell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vukotich hasn't spoken to any of the investors long enough to get an offer. Two neighbors said investors had, unprompted, offered them $50,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to say how much Mr. Vukotich's house is worth. The county tax assessment values the property at $47,900. In 2016, it was appraised for $55,000, the price Mr. Vukotich paid his mother for it. <span class="companylink">Zillow Group Inc</span>.'s Zestimate tool, which isn't as accurate as an appraisal, puts it at over $125,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bell, who doesn't invest in Penn Hills, said his models suggest the fixed-up house might go for between $115,000 and $120,000—well above what an investor would look to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vukotich has no plans to sell, though his son and daughter-in-law would like to live closer to public transportation one day. He knows one thing: He won't be calling any of the numbers on the mailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's an owner-occupied neighborhood, and we want to keep it that way," Mr. Vukotich said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is so hot that some homeowners have become afraid to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In more normal times, first-time home buyers move into starter homes. As their families grow, they upgrade to bigger houses[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/selling-to-buy-a-bigger-home-it-may-be-rough-in-this-hot-market-11621675802?mod=searchresults_pos10&amp;page=1]. Eventually, empty-nesters and retirees sell their larger homes to downsize or relocate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, record-high prices[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-housing-market-is-crazier-than-its-been-since-2006-11617422403?mod=series_housingmarket] are disrupting the usual churn. Plenty of households could sell their homes for a big profit[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/how-to-sell-a-home-2021-mortgage-loans-sellers-market-11617400722?mod=series_housingmarket], but then they would have to find a new place to live. Many are unwilling to compete in this frenzied housing market[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/how-to-buy-a-home-2021-how-much-house-can-i-afford-11617400553?mod=series_housingmarket], where they could be subjected to the fierce and costly bidding wars that have become commonplace across the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's hard to upgrade," said Thad Wong, co-founder of Chicago-based brokerage @properties. "Even with low rates and the appreciation of their home, they can't find something better than what they live in right now," he said of prospective sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fear of failing to find a new residence is the latest reason homeowners are staying in their homes longer than they did in the past. Many baby boomers are choosing to delay retirement or age in place. And now, some young families who want to trade up worry they've been priced out of their neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad and Jami Pettiford, for instance, bought their first house in October 2015 in Grosse Pointe Woods, Mich., for $162,000. They've since had a second child and want more space. But the nearby homes on their wish list cost more than $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It makes you pause and think, is it really worth it?" Mr. Pettiford said. "It's like, man, I really love this area, but we're naturally priced out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many homeowners staying put, U.S. housing inventory has rarely been tighter[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-market-is-nearly-4-million-homes-short-of-buyer-demand-11618484400?mod=series_housingmarket]. The number of existing homes on the market at the end of April was down 20.5% from a year earlier, and the number of homes for sale fell to record lows earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That scarcity has helped lift home prices to all-time highs and has started to slow down the pace of sales. Pinched supply is a big reason many economists expect home prices to continue to rise, making homeownership prohibitively expensive for many buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the homeowner's dilemma is the timing of dual transactions. Many families need to sell their current house before they can afford to buy a new one. In a less-heated market, buyers can make an offer on a home that is contingent upon selling their current home. But sellers today often receive multiple bids, and those with contingency clauses are unlikely to be accepted, agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sellers negotiate rent-back agreements, so they can stay in their home for a month or longer after selling while they house hunt. Others move in with family or find a short-term rental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sometimes that backfires, and people end up living with relatives for way longer than they thought they were going to," said Meredith Hansen, operating principal at Keller Williams Greater Seattle. "I don't think we can really alleviate the shortage until people feel like they can sell their home and move."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply shortage is especially acute at lower price points. The inventory of existing homes on the market priced between $100,000 and $250,000 slid more than 30% in April from a year ago, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said, while the supply of homes for sale above $500,000 rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lexi and Brendan McDonald, who have four children, bought a four-bedroom house near Boise, Idaho, in 2019 for about $235,000, Ms. McDonald said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We thought, 'Oh, the boys can share a room and the girls can share a room, and then we'll have an extra bedroom that we can use as an office,' " Ms. McDonald said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their children don't sleep well in shared bedrooms anymore, Ms. McDonald said, and the family wants to upgrade to a bigger home. But five-bedroom homes in their area cost at least $400,000, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Boise metro area posted the fastest home-price growth in the country in the first quarter, up 28.2% from a year earlier, according to a <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> ranking of the country's 100 biggest metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our house is worth probably around $330,000 or $340,000 at this point, which is fantastic, but we couldn't afford to move anywhere," Ms. McDonald said. They are considering relocating to Texas.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Catherine and Blake Winslow were able to make the move-up purchase work. They listed their starter home north of Salt Lake City, which they had bought in 2013, and included a 60-day rent-back as a condition of the sale. Then they started shopping aggressively, touring dozens of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They lost out twice to higher bidders. "All of our family members and friends were like, 'You can sell, but where will you go?' And we were starting to feel like they were right," Ms. Winslow said. They looked for short-term rentals in case they couldn't find a home within the 60-day deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They ended up getting an offer accepted on a for-sale-by-owner listing and moved in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We feel so incredibly lucky," she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael S. Derby </div><div>807 words</div><div>3 June 2021</div><div>05:30</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2021, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Federal Reserve officials edge toward a debate on the winddown of their asset-buying stimulus program, their purchases of mortgage bonds could become a focal point of a shift in monetary policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic over a year ago, the Fed has sought to pack more stimulative power into its monetary policy by joining its near-zero interest rate stance with hefty purchases of Treasury and mortgage bonds. Each month, the Fed aims to buy $80 billion in government debt and $40 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the buying started last year, the purchases were aimed at smoothing unsettled financial markets. Once that was largely accomplished, the Fed came to view the buying as outright stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the need for this cushion is now in question as the economy roars back to life. Some in the markets also have concerns that inflation could overheat and financial markets become turbulent from too much liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, a range of Fed officials have said they are now ready to at least talk about pulling back some of that support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it is appropriate for us to slowly, carefully move back[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/feds-harker-it-may-soon-be-time-to-think-about-tapering-bond-buying-11622649601?mod=searchresults_pos1&amp;page=1] on our purchases at the appropriate time," Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said on Wednesday, even as he added that a time frame for action "is not yet decided."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future of the Fed's mortgage bond-buying has loomed particularly large in the debate because in its most direct impact, it makes borrowing cheaper in a housing sector that is already on fire[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-accelerates-in-march-11621947742]. Inventories are low, and prices are surging across the nation. Some argue the Fed could dial down the pressure a bit with no adverse economic impact by easing up on mortgage-buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much as the Fed's overall plans for pulling back on bond-buying remain hazy, so, too, is its agenda on mortgage bonds. While some officials may struggle to parse the exact impact[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/derbys-take-firm-measurements-of-feds-bond-buying-success-prove-elusive-11620379802?mod=searchresults_pos18&amp;page=2] of the Fed's bond-buying, key leaders are nevertheless confident that mortgage bond purchases benefit more than just the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed mortgage-buying "has a direct powerful effect on mortgage rates, but it also has a pretty powerful effect[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/derbys-take-feds-williams-flags-potency-of-mortgage-bond-buying-11620120602?mod=searchresults_pos5&amp;page=3] on other financial conditions like corporate bonds and other interest rates like that," New York Fed President John Williams said in early May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">St. Louis Fed President James Bullard is open to talking about the mortgage bond issue when the time comes, saying last month that "the housing market is booming" and the Fed's approach to mortgage-buying "would be a good topic for debate and will be debated once the taper debate opens." Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, would decide when to start the shift, Mr. Bullard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking last week, Randal Quarles, the central bank's point man on financial regulation issues[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/feds-quarles-if-economy-meets-expectations-time-to-talk-taper-approaching-11622057556?mod=searchresults_pos9&amp;page=1], agreed mortgage-buying was "ripe for reconsideration," and suggested simple policy inertia might explain why it is still going on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Fed is a Leviathan that moves cautiously, but surely, in changing direction," he said, adding that it would be looking at mortgage-buying at some point, without being specific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Fed Governor Lael Brainard, doesn't seem to be in any hurry to pull back on the mortgage bond-buying. In comments on Tuesday[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/brainard-says-fed-should-be-prepared-to-adjust-policy-if-needed-11622571211?mod=searchresults_pos2&amp;page=1], she suggested that, like Mr. Williams, she sees benefits to the buying that extend beyond housing. What's more, Ms. Brainard doesn't seem to believe the Fed is causing the housing sector to be hotter than it would otherwise be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said housing vigor is "reflecting very high demand" in a market with a reduced number of houses for sale. And more broadly, what is going on in housing doesn't seem to carry any systemic risk to either the economy or the financial system, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In home lending markets, "underwriting terms are just much stronger, and generally household balance sheets are much healthier," so it is not appropriate to compare the current state of the housing market and how it is financed with the period preceding the financial crisis more than a decade ago, Ms. Brainard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate over the Fed's bond-buying program and its mortgage component is unsettled enough that it is unclear whether there will be any news when the Fed next meets on monetary policy on June 15 and 16. Some economists expect the process of slowing the bond-buying may be announced at the end of the summer[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/derbys-take-economists-says-late-summer-may-bring-formal-fed-taper-talk-11621503007?mod=searchresults_pos19&amp;page=1] and then begun early next year.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's home-buying frenzy is cooling off as limited inventory and record high prices are excluding potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell 2.7% in April from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.85 million, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. April marked the third straight monthly decline, the longest downward stretch since last spring, when Covid-19-related lockdowns eased and buyers started flocking to tour homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forces driving home sales haven't gone away. Low mortgage rates and the rise of remote work, which sent buyers scrambling to find larger living spaces, are still spurring demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year started off strong, after 2020 experienced the fastest pace of home sales in 14 years, but that slackened as prices rose and houses on the market fell. The median existing-home price jumped to $341,600 in April, the highest on record, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said. The annual price appreciation of more than 19% was the strongest in data going back to 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rise in prices that we've seen and the lack of supply, particularly at lower price points, is dragging down sales," said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics. "I think that's going to be the story moving forward."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market was a bright spot in an otherwise sputtering economy for much of past year. Housing was one of the few sectors that responded positively to the changing lifestyle dynamics brought on by the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as the broader economy looks stronger, the housing market is showing its first real signs of slower growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts cautioned against overstating the slower pace, noting that home sales still stand at a historically high level. Near-record-low borrowing rates, and a wave of millennials entering their prime home-buying years, are still spurring strong demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even with home sales declining modestly, one can describe the market as being hot," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many brokers also hope that increasing vaccinations and the loosening of federal and local restrictions will encourage more homeowners to list their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the third straight month of weaker sales growth caught many housing analysts by surprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 0.2% monthly increase in sales of previously owned homes, which make up most of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for newly built homes has also climbed in the past year, but builders' ability to increase production is limited by the amount of available land and the increasing cost of materials such as lumber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts, a measure of U.S. home-building, fell 9.5% in April from March, the Commerce Department said this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The big story in the housing market is all the constraints on builders," said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. "The supply is just too low."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's one reason why existing homes are selling unusually quickly. The typical home that sold in April spent 17 days on the market, the quickest pace on a decade of records, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's fastest moving housing market in April was Indianapolis, where the typical home went under contract after only four days, according to brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Hopefully the inventory comes back up, because it's just been nuts," said Chris Golightly, a real-estate agent in Indianapolis. "It's fantastic for the seller, but it sure can create some really frustrated potential buyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 1.16 million homes for sale at the end of April, up 10.5% from March and down 20.5% from April 2020. At the current sales pace, there was a 2.4-month supply of homes on the market at the end of April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kendra Mahoney and Kevin McGrath made three unsuccessful offers to buy homes in the Boston suburbs before getting one accepted in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the house they bought, they viewed it the first day it was on the market and brought an inspector with them to the showing, Mr. McGrath said. That helped them feel comfortable putting in an offer that didn't require a home inspection, to make their bid more appealing to the seller. The sale closed in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have a lot of empathy for anyone going through the process right now. It's really tough," Mr. McGrath said. "We were just so relieved that something ended up working out for us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers accounted for 31% of sales in April, down from 32% in March, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said. All-cash transactions made up 25% of sales, up from 23% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales continued to be especially strong at the high end of the market, as sales of homes priced over $1 million more than tripled in April compared with a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                        Home prices in the U.S.[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-housing-market-is-crazier-than-its-been-since-2006-11617422403?mod=article_inline] have shot up in the past year, driven by limited supply, record-low interest rates and buyer demand[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/americans-up-and-moved-during-the-pandemic-heres-where-they-went-11620734566?mod=article_inline]. Bidding wars have spread from such high-profile locations as Palm Beach, Fla., and the suburbs outside New York City to smaller cities and towns, including long-neglected locales where properties typically sat on the market for months. The rise in prices is making it hard for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key Takeaways</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Prices are skyrocketing in places that recently offered affordable entry to the middle class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allentown, Pa., is a Rust-Belt city whose decline was memorialized in a 1982 Billy Joel song. The median listed price for a house in the metropolitan area surrounding Allentown jumped 24% in January from a year earlier, according to data from Realtor.com. Prices also jumped in such spots as Martin, Tenn., a small city 150 miles from Nashville, where the median asking price went up 159% over the same period; in Kendallville, Ind., about 30 miles outside Fort Wayne, it climbed 56%. The average price for a house in the Allentown metro area was about $225,000 a year ago, said Jonathan Campbell, vice president of DLP Realty in Bethlehem. It has since shot past $270,000. The market is so hot that open houses trigger traffic jams, and properties sell in 48 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Local buyers are bidding against one another, as well as against investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors now comprise about a fifth of annual home sales nationally. Online platforms such as BiggerPockets and Fundrise make it easier for out-of-town investors to buy real estate in smaller cities across the U.S., said John Burns of California-based John Burns Real Estate Consulting. Often, Mr. Burns said, "the cash flows are better in the Tulsas and Allentowns of the world" for those looking to rent out properties. In the fourth quarter of 2020, nearly a fifth of homes sold in the Allentown area were bought by investors, according to Mr. Burns's data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Because of low inventory, buyers feel pressured to make snap decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the exception of a few urban markets, including Manhattan and San Francisco, the U.S. is seeing "a chronic shortage of inventory, heavy sales volume and prices rising at levels wildly ahead of income growth," said Jonathan Miller of New York-based Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers and Consultants. Some buyers are willing to go above the asking price and forgo routine home inspections for fear of losing to another bidder. "If you're a buyer, this is the most frustrating time," said Jonathan Campbell, vice president of DLP Realty in Bethlehem. The local market, he said, is outpacing the mid-2000s housing boom.[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-pandemic-ignited-a-housing-boombut-its-different-from-the-last-one-11615824558?mod=article_inline]

</div><div class="author">By Ryan Dezember, Joe Wallace and Andrew Barnett </div><div>1414 words</div><div>20 May 2021</div><div>09:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for the building blocks of the economy have surged over the past year. Oil, copper, corn and gasoline futures all cost about twice what they did a year ago, when much of the world was locked down to fight the spread of the deadly coronavirus. Lumber has more than tripled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of investors would probably see this chart and say it screams inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring commodity prices have stoked fierce debate on Wall Street and in Washington, D.C. over inflation and whether the fiscal and monetary policies intended to buffer the economy during the pandemic might now risk hobbling the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the heart of the debate is how much of the climb in commodity prices can be attributed to transitory, temporary shocks that should ease as the world's economy moves further from lockdown, and how much of the rise will last and spread to other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many markets, the factors driving up prices appear fleeting. The economic reopening has been bumpy. Inventories are depleted, leading to big restocking orders and putting premiums on near-term deliveries of raw materials. Supply lines are jammed, creating pockets of scarcity and adding costs that are passed on to consumers  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/raw-materials-prices-have-surged-corporate-profits-are-likely-next-11618219801]. Some of the price gains seem sharp but have only just completed their recovery from last spring's pandemic market panic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the pandemic's hottest commodity, lumber  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/record-lumber-prices-lift-sawmills-while-homeowners-do-it-yourselfers-pay-up-11620034201]—a market in which demand is tied to interest rates and home prices—has supply issues unique to the wood-products business that have helped fuel the gains. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber prices have benefited from low interest rates and a home-remodeling boom. PHOTO: Charlotte Kesl for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for lumber soared to more than four times their normal level during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fiscal and monetary policies that have padded American bank accounts and kept money cheap have propelled the rise. So has a shortage of sawmills relative to the last time so many houses were being built  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-pandemic-ignited-a-housing-boombut-its-different-from-the-last-one-11615824558?mod=article_inline].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has stoked the hot housing market by holding interest rates to near zero, keeping mortgage payments low. Rising home prices and low rates have helped those who owned homes refinance and pocket cash without adding much to payments. Mortgage-finance firm Freddie Mac  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/market-data/quotes/FMCC] estimates that Americans last year withdrew nearly $153 billion  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/cash-out-refinancings-hit-highest-level-since-financial-crisis-11615458602?mod=article_inline] from their homes in cash-out refinancings, much of which has been spent in a remodeling boom  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-depot-covid-coronavirus-home-improvement-lockdowns-stimulus-check-remodel-11597426959?mod=article_inline].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sawmills shut down like most other businesses early on in the pandemic, but they ramped back up toward capacity. U.S. wood-product output returned to pre-pandemic levels in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet it remains about 15% lower than the 2006 peak, the last time housing starts were so strong. That housing boom turned out to be a bubble that nearly sank the global economy when it burst. Sawmills suffered through a slow recovery. There were closures, consolidation and not a lot of investment in new capacity  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/despite-lumber-boom-few-new-sawmills-coming-11621243982], setting the stage for surging prices during the next housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial metals are another prime beneficiary of the reopening economy and a lack of investment in new mines since the last price bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper, closely linked to global growth because of its use in housing and electronics, has never been more expensive. Prices have soared above $10,000 a metric ton and recently topped the previous high, from 2011.  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/bets-on-economic-rebound-push-copper-prices-to-record-high-11620384716]
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Record imports by China, which quashed the coronavirus faster than the West and went on a commodities buying spree, initially powered industrial metals higher. Now Americans are spending their savings and stimulus checks on houses, renovations and consumer goods that make use of the metal. Meanwhile, boosting production at mines takes months, and work at many was disrupted by Covid-19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you think rising commodity prices signal inflation? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But behind the gains, some analysts also see a rush into speculative bets  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/a-red-hot-copper-fund-could-lose-its-shine-11619091011]on everything from reopening to electric cars. Elevated prices are prompting some buyers in China, which accounts for half the world's refined-copper consumption, to cut back. And the gap between spot prices and those for copper delivered in three months suggests there isn't a shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there are some increases that aren't quite what they seem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gas and oil</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gasoline futures prices have doubled over the past year as the economy has reopened and the temporary shutdown this month of the East Coast's main pipeline for refined fuels led to regional price jumps and shortages. Still, gasoline prices aren't far out of line historically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gasoline futures in New York have averaged $2.13 a gallon this month, 6.5% above the average May price from 2001 to 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price at the pump also has a lot to do with state and local taxes, and the cost of getting fuel to filling stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a similar story for crude oil. West Texas Intermediate, the main U.S. price, has cost $65.08 a barrel this month, 19 cents shy of the average over the past two decades, excluding 2020 when prices tanked amid the pandemic's shutdowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shipping</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bottlenecks in the shipping industry are giving some commodity prices a leg up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pandemic—and the surge in demand for goods sparked by stay-at-home orders—threw supply chains into disarray. In the container shipping industry, the disruption remains acute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That feeds into higher prices for commodities such as tin and sugar in two ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders face weekslong delays to move materials from Asia to the U.S. and Europe. The result is localized shortages in the West,  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/tin-prices-soar-on-electronics-demand-shipping-trouble-11620811801] just as demand is climbing. Plus, traders are paying several times more for a berth on container ships than on the eve of the pandemic. They pass that cost on to customers  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/shipping-container-shortage-gives-commodity-prices-extra-boost-11613648648] in the form of higher commodity prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of transporting commodities such as iron ore and coal in bulk is climbing, too. The Baltic Dry Index, which tracks rates along 20 sea routes, recently touched its highest level since 2010. Still, it is well below where it stood during the China-led commodities boom of the 2000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corn</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corn is a good example of a commodity sent soaring by low supplies and transportation problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Near-term corn futures are much higher than those for later in the year. That is unusual. The remnants of the previous year's harvest usually cost less than the coming autumn's crop this time of year. When near-term futures shoot up like they have, it is usually because of a big shock to either supply or demand, as in 2013 after drought withered the U.S. crop and prices hit records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     This time  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/corn-is-the-latest-commodity-to-pop-11620644400] it is a drought in South America that has left the global market short of supply. Meanwhile, demand is rising. U.S. drivers are returning to the road, meaning more corn blended into motor fuels as ethanol. China is expected to import about four times what it normally buys from abroad as it races to fatten millions of hogs to replace those killed to fend off an outbreak of African swine fever before the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And one commodity isn't marching higher, just when you might think it would.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often touted as an inflation hedge, gold has fallen about 1% this year to $1,881.30 a troy ounce, despite a recent uptick in prices. Gold surged to a record in August, lifted by supply disruptions and investors' worries about the pandemic's duration  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/gold-climbs-to-all-time-high-topping-2011-record-11595612234]. Big-name investors including Ray Dalio and Paul Tudor Jones touted its potential protection against a stimulus-fueled inflation spike. It has fallen about 8% since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said that is mainly a sign investors aren't anticipating that consumer prices will surge beyond the Fed's control. After adjusting for inflation expectations, yields on 10-year Treasury notes have climbed for much of this year. Since gold pays no income, some investors said, it tends to struggle to compete with yield-bearing assets when so-called real yields on Treasurys rise.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                        <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. extended a streak of robust sales growth in its latest quarter as a rise in demand that began with the coronavirus pandemic continued into 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brisk sales to both professional buyers and do-it-yourself customers boosted growth, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> executives said. Demand for supplies has continued into May, they added, following a quarter with a higher level of big-ticket transactions and continuing sales of wood products as lumber prices soar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the pandemic eases and the U.S. economy reopens, a booming housing market is supporting sales-growth trends, which were initially fueled by consumers stocking up and doing home projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As home values grow, people feel good about investing in their home overall," Home Depot Chief Executive Craig Menear said on a conference call with analysts. "That alone is, I think, a very positive outlook for home improvement as you move forward."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales for the Atlanta-based home-improvement retailer climbed to $37.5 billion in the three months ended May 2, from $28.26 billion in last year's fiscal first quarter. Profit rose to $4.15 billion, or $3.86 a share, from $2.25 billion, or $2.08 a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street analysts had forecast sales of $34.82 billion and profit of $3.02 a share, according to a FactSet survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a comparable-store basis, the company's sales rose 31%, including a 30% climb in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first two weeks of May, U.S. comparable sales growth was greater than 30% compared with 2019 levels, a sign that pandemic-era shopping trends have continued, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail told analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Wall Street analysts said Tuesday that the stronger-than-expected results would likely lead to higher consensus estimates for <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s performance in coming quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber -- often cited in recent months by investors and businesses as a contributor to inflation concerns -- has continued to fly off shelves amid rising prices, Ted Decker, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s operating chief, said on the call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As soon as that product hits our stores, it sells," Mr. Decker said. He cited sawmill capacity as a supply-chain bottleneck that was contributing to higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Input prices also have been rising in other categories, Mr. McPhail said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are seeing cost pressures in this environment just like everyone is. Supply chains are pressured, transportation is pressured," Mr. McPhail said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that the company has been working with vendors and managing retail prices to keep products cost effective for customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big-ticket sales -- transactions above $1,000 -- also indicated a strong willingness by shoppers to spend on home improvement, rising by about 50% on a comparable basis year over year. The average ticket rose to $82.37, from $74.70 in last year's first quarter. <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s tally of customer transactions rose to 447.2 million in the quarter, from 374.8 million a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as much in-person retail evaporated last spring, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> worked to keep its stores open, arguing that it should be considered an essential retailer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the year since, it also has benefited from the strong housing market and government policies such as enhanced unemployment benefits and stimulus checks that have supported consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a Covid-19 vaccination campaign has eased the pandemic's caseload this spring, consumer behavior is evolving once more. In April, U.S. retail sales were flat from March, representing a plateau following seasonally adjusted growth from the pandemic's worst months.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Mike Bird </div><div>488 words</div><div>17 May 2021</div><div>07:57</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In discussions about China's frothy real-estate market[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-property-real-estate-boom-covid-pandemic-bubble-11594908517], the country's parlous demographics are often raised as a looming threat. As the national population begins to decline in the coming years, won't the market lose some steam?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps not—at least in the places foreigners are most inclined to watch. One way of thinking about the question is to look at areas where population decline has already begun, in some cases at considerable speed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Batson, China research director for Gavekal Dragonomics, notes that the 2020 census[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-says-its-population-rose-slightly-in-2020-11620698964] implies a much sharper decline in the populations of three northeastern provinces[https://andrewbatson.com/2021/05/12/china-census-reveals-the-true-scale-of-the-northeasts-decline/] than previously believed. Since 2010, the recorded populations of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang have declined by 2.6%, 12.3% and 16.9%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Bureau of Statistics monitors the selling prices of homes in five of those provinces' largest cities: Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin, Changchun and Jilin City. And in the past five years, newly built residential property prices have risen by at least 40% in each of them. Properties are far cheaper than in the wealthiest cities, but the climb in prices hardly reflects the reality of a sliding provincial population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a major qualifier to the data, of course: The story in many smaller urban areas is almost certainly much bleaker. Comprehensive, up-to-date granular data on population sizes isn't available. But that reinforces the point that speculative activity can continue in the bigger cities—where most of it takes place already—for quite some time after a province's demographics turn sharply negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study published last year[https://www-hindawi-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/journals/complexity/2020/5104578/] looked at vacancy rates in Chinese cities[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinas-empire-of-concrete-11609156335], based on nighttime light data. According to the estimates, vacancy rates run to around 22% in Dalian, Harbin, Changchun and Shenyang—above the already-high 15% and 16% seen in Shenzhen and Shanghai, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese real-estate markets' ability to sustain both very high vacancy rates and surging prices is excellent evidence of speculation. And since speculative behavior isn't always based on actual economic conditions, there is no immediate reason to believe that demographic shifts will cool the housing market—at least in big cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents in the northeast, which are more directly determined by actual supply and demand for lodging, tell a different story. In Harbin and Dalian, monthly rents per square meter have barely budged in the past decade—in contrast to the approximate doubling in tier one markets like Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demographics could eventually become a key factor in the big Chinese housing markets. But right now, even a falling national population wouldn't necessarily be an impetus for rapid change.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week's data will show how economies around the globe are faring at different stages of recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/news/collection/coronavirus-6dcf2a21].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China, investment, industrial output and retail sales are expected to advance at a slower pace in April than March—partly because of the comparison to figures from a year earlier, when the world's second-largest economy was slowly emerging from its coronavirus lockdown. Retail sales are expected to have risen 24.9% from a year earlier in April, according to a median forecast of 15 economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Fixed-asset investment likely rose 19.2% in the first four months of the year, and industrial production, often considered a proxy for growth, is forecast to jump 9.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter of 2021, Japan's economy likely contracted 1.2% from the previous quarter, according to economists surveyed by data provider Quick. Economists say private consumption weakened in the three months to March due to the government's state of emergency in some major prefectures, including Tokyo and Osaka.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts rose to a nearly 15-year high in March, underscoring strong demand for homes amid low interest rates, millennials entering their prime homebuying years and a desire for more household space driven by the pandemic. Builders, however, have complained of rising lumber costs and labor-supply constraints, and economists are forecasting a small step back in April construction numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. jobless claims fell to a fresh pandemic low during the first full week of May[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-05-13-2021-11620849983]. Another step down during the week ended May 15 would be a sign businesses are hiring new workers and holding on to the ones they have as the labor market steadily improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surveys of purchasing managers are expected to record an acceleration in eurozone activity during May, underpinning expectations that the currency area's economy will return to growth in the second quarter having endured a recession during the previous six months. However, similar surveys for the U.S. are expected to record a stronger expansion, with the growth gap widest for the services sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median U.S. existing-home sales price in March rose to a record high[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-march-existing-home-sales-drop-on-tight-supply-11619100759], taking some steam out of the market at the start of the peak spring selling season. For April, economists say those rising prices and limited inventories of homes for sale could once again tamp down sales despite low mortgage rates and sky-high demand.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past whipsaw pandemic year, the U.S. real-estate market went from essentially shut down to an unprecedented rally[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-prices-surge-higher-pricing-out-many-buyers-11620748183]. Today, increased demand has dwarfed the supply of homes coming on the market in many areas. The result is a severe inventory shortage[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-market-is-nearly-4-million-homes-short-of-buyer-demand-11618484400]spanning much of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For this year's Real Estate Guide, The Wall Street Journal partnered with Realtor.com to analyze inventory in luxury real-estate markets across the country. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.) Our data looked at more than 1,000 ZIP Codes with a median listing price of $750,000 and up, and compared average monthly inventory levels from the beginning of 2017 through the end of 2019 with those from March 2020 to February 2021. The results show that the most dramatic inventory drops occurred in vacation destinations, such as Cape Cod and the Jersey Shore, and exurbs of major cities that were once too far away for commuters. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris and Ashley Fleming, with their children Alanna and Carter, sold their home in Bryn Mawr, Pa., for over $1 million, all cash, in just three days. They had listed it for $899,000. PHOTO: Will Figg for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other end of the spectrum, some luxury markets have seen significant increases in the number of homes for sale since the pandemic. Most of these are dense urban areas with a large proportion of condos and co-ops, or single-family houses on small lots: Several neighborhoods in Los Angeles saw large upticks in inventory, as did areas of New York City, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, Seattle and Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the many areas where inventory has shrunk, buyers are getting creative to make their offers stand out from the pack[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/from-oscars-tickets-to-harry-potter-themed-videos-homebuyers-are-spicing-up-their-offers-11610643944]. Some buyers write a love letter[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424127887323482504578227703128967098] to the seller, with photos and an explanation of the bidder's plans for the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That strategy helped DJ and Lauren Bowser land a single-family house in the Miracle Mile neighborhood of Los Angeles. After getting outbid on three properties[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/why-homes-for-sale-in-these-housing-markets-nearly-disappeared-during-covid-11620925226], they bid on a house listed for $1.299 million. Along with their offer of $1.485 million, they sent photos of their dog, Bear, and a letter explaining that Bear was an apartment dog who would love to have a backyard. It worked: They got the house for $1.4815 million (they got some seller's credits) by beating out seven other offers, including one that was higher than theirs. The seller loved the photos of Bear, according to the Bowsers' real-estate agent, the Agency's Stephen Katz, who noted they also had a very strong offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But home seller Ashley Fleming discouraged buyers from writing love letters. She and her husband, Chris, listed their house in Bryn Mawr, Pa., on a Friday in early March, asking $899,000. They got nine offers, and by Sunday evening had a signed contract for over $1 million, all cash with no contingencies. She said she received two or three personal letters—one asking to see the house before it was listed on the market—and ignored them. "I have to say that the personal letter is a total dud," she said. "We had the attitude of, 'show us the money, because that's what's really going to get you the house.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In areas with higher inventory, however, selling a home is what takes creativity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, single-family homes priced under $2 million are selling quickly, agents said, but condos and pricier homes take longer to sell. Julie Stevens, 54, founder of a line of low-calorie cocktails called BeTini, listed her six-bedroom house in Santa Monica for $5.8 million in August 2020. The house had been sitting on the market for months, with multiple price cuts, when she hired a new agent, Rochelle Atlas Maize of Nourmand &amp; Associates. While touring the house, Ms. Maize was inspired when she saw a projector screen in the basement with lighting to go with it. She hatched a plan to stage the house with TikTok and <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> influencers in mind, then let them film at the house free to generate publicity. Dubbed "Hype House West," the house got multiple offers and is now in escrow for $5.175 million, just under its most recent asking price of $5.299 million. The buyer saw the house on social media, Ms. Maize said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help buyers and sellers navigate this strange new world, we offer a look at some of the communities with the lowest inventory compared with pre-pandemic norms, explore the reasons why these areas are so hot, and introduce you to some buyers and sellers who have successfully completed a home sale in these communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cape Cod, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This peninsula has always been a popular vacation and retirement destination for New Englanders. But demand for Cape Cod homes has skyrocketed during the pandemic, as people flock here in search of rural surroundings and ocean access, said local real-estate agent Paul Grover of Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Robert Paul Properties. The Cape is easily reachable by car at a time when air travel is still fraught, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Cape homeowners aren't selling. "They're using the home, or the family is using the home, more than they had been," Mr. Grover said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August 2020, Noreen and Rich Clifford started looking for a retirement home in Dennis, about midway down the Cape peninsula, where they had vacationed for years and have family. The couple had always planned to retire on Cape Cod, but were in no rush to sell their home in the Boston suburb of Braintree until their daughter called in August to tell them her best friend wanted to buy their house. "We looked at each other and said, 'let's do it,' " Ms. Clifford recalled. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noreen and Rich Clifford at their new home on Cape Cod. PHOTO: Cody O'Loughlin for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When house-hunting on the Cape, the couple looked at roughly 50 houses. "It was like a frenzy," said Mr. Clifford, 66, a retired police officer. "That's the only way to describe it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had had no luck by the time they closed on the sale of the Braintree house in November, so they stayed in a friend's vacation home in Dennis for several months while continuing their search. Ms. Clifford resorted to putting notes in the mailboxes of houses they liked, asking if the owners would consider selling. One homeowner responded to her note, telling her he had received five other unsolicited offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, they landed a three-bedroom house in East Dennis listed at $780,000. They offered $810,000. The inspection revealed a failed septic system. The Cliffords bought the home with the failed septic in exchange for a price reduction. They ultimately paid $790,000, moving in on April 5. Their original budget had been $750,000, recalled Mr. Clifford, "and I thought that was stretching it." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jersey Shore, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jersey Shore has seen inventory dry up: The community of Normandy Beach saw a 79% inventory drop, according to Realtor.com data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Cape Cod owners, Jersey Shore owners are using their homes, says Jeffrey Childers of Childers Sotheby's International Realty in Normandy Beach. Gary Greendale, one of Mr. Childers's clients, and his girlfriend, Linda Rivera, started looking for a waterfront vacation home on the shore in the spring of 2020, thinking they would land something in time for summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, said Mr. Greendale, 56, who works in finance in Manhattan, "some of the areas we looked at, we'd be paying all-time record high levels. We got kind of discouraged."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He started looking farther south, where prices are lower but the drive from his primary home in North Caldwell, N.J., would be longer. Finally, he nabbed a house in Bayville, N.J., with a dock on a lagoon asking $735,000. He paid $785,000 for the property, and purchased the seller's Bayliner XR7 powerboat. They closed in January, roughly nine months after starting their search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bayville is about one hour and 20 minutes from his home—farther than he wanted—but he's pleased to have finally found something. "I'm looking forward to bringing our family out on the boat," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sun Valley, Idaho</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the pandemic, Sun Valley's isolation and natural beauty have made it a magnet for professionals no longer tethered to working in an office, according to local real-estate agent Janine Bear. As a result, Sun Valley's 83353 ZIP Code saw a drop in inventory of 67%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salt Lake City residents Ryan and Nora Peterson bought their three-bedroom Sun Valley vacation condo in 2018 for $695,000 and spent about $200,000 remodeling it. They were using it less as their children got busier with sports and other activities. When Sun Valley home prices climbed during the pandemic, they decided to sell. They listed it with Ms. Bear for $1.15 million, got nine offers and sold it within three days for $1.515 million in cash. The purchasers, from Florida, had never even seen the condo until the day before closing, Ms. Peterson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Priest Lake, Idaho</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, city dwellers working remotely have relocated to the tiny towns along Idaho's Priest Lake, which include Priest Lake, Nordman, and Coolin, where inventory has dropped by 67%, according to Realtor.com data. Local real-estate agent Kara Williams of Priest Lake Realty says buyers are drawn not only by the rural surroundings and natural beauty of the lake, but because the area had fewer pandemic restrictions than California and Washington state. Restaurants were open and so was the small local school. "A lot of people that had second homes already were moving here so kids could be in school in person," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exurbs of Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exurbs of major cities—towns beyond the inner ring of suburbs—have seen major inventory decreases since the pandemic. This effect is particularly pronounced outside Washington, D.C.[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/covid-19-kindled-washington-d-c-s-luxury-market-the-new-administration-could-make-it-even-hotter-11611249368], in areas such as Howard County, Md., and Fairfax County, Va. The area has a strong economy due to <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> and other tech companies, and with buyers looking for more space amid the pandemic, small towns such as Glenwood, Md., and Fairfax Station, Va., have quickly seen their inventory evaporate. Inventory fell 67% in Glenwood and 65% in Fairfax Station, according to Realtor.com data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard County residents Dave and Tracy Duvall started looked for a new home this winter. They were living in Laurel, Md., but wanted a larger home closer to their children's private school. Before the pandemic, Mr. Duvall, 42, commuted to Silver Spring, Md., for his job but now has to go to the office only about half the time. "The commute to work became secondary," he said. "We were looking for views that were woods and nature rather than another set of windows."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After several months of searching with Creig Northrop of Northrop Realty, they found a five-bedroom house on an acre of land in Howard County's Ellicott City, where one ZIP Code was down 53% from pre-pandemic inventory levels. The home was listed at $950,000 and the Duvalls were determined to get it, so they bid $100,000 over the asking price with an open-escalation clause, meaning they would top any other offer. They also waived the home inspection and offered to pay all the out-of-pocket costs for closing. The house was listed on a Thursday and there were 15 offers by Saturday night, but the Duvalls' offer was accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">King County, Wash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory in Seattle's eastern suburbs has dwindled since the pandemic, according to Windermere Real Estate agent Karl Lindor. Small towns such as Carnation—where inventory dropped 65%, according to Realtor.com—were once considered too far from the city by many commuters but are suddenly more desirable, drawing buyers priced out of closer-in suburbs like Sammamish and Issaquah, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selling in a Low-Inventory Market? Here's What You Should Know</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* PRICE CORRECTLY: Sellers may not think they have to pay attention to pricing in the country's many hot markets, but it is still important to price a house correctly, said Jessie Simmons, a Coldwell Banker agent in Chelan, Wash. Buyers and their agents have access to lots of pricing information and they likely won't touch a house that seems wildly overpriced. Such a house can sit on the market and require price cuts, which reinforces buyers' perception that there is something wrong with the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* REMOVE OBJECTIONS: To maximize the sale price of a home, Westchester County real-estate agent Betsy Ronel advises getting rid of as many "perceivable objections" from the home as possible before listing. Paint kitchen cabinets white and remove wall-to-wall carpeting, which tends to turn off buyers, she advises. Most importantly, make sure the house does not smell of pets or cigarettes. If needed, hire someone to deep-clean the home. "A house must smell clean," she said. "If not, the buyers will knock the price way down in their head."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kristian Erickson and his girlfriend, Cori Walters, each owned a townhouse in Issaquah when they started looking to buy a home together. Concerned about finding the type of house they wanted in Issaquah, they started looking farther east and north. When they saw a 5-acre property with a view of the Cascades, a barn and a soccer field in the small town of Fall City, they fell for it immediately. The property was listed for $1.182 million. There were 13 bidders: Mr. Erickson and Ms. Walters got it for $1.451 million, waiving their home inspection and appraisal contingency. Ms. Walters also wrote a letter to the sellers describing how much they loved the property and how they planned to use it.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Essex County, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Essex County, on the North Shore of Boston, has been popular during the pandemic because of its sought-after school districts and proximity to the ocean, said agent Jack Brown of Sagan Harborside Sotheby's International Realty. In the Essex County town of Lynnfield, inventory plummeted 63%, according to Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Flemings experienced the hot market firsthand when they found out they would be relocating from Philadelphia to Boston for Mr. Fleming's job. The family started looking at houses outside Boston starting in January, zeroing in on the Essex County town of Andover, where inventory has dropped 42%. They made offers on several houses but were outbid.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The red-hot U.S. housing market is giving an extra boost to the cheapest houses, including many in historically stagnant neighborhoods that have suffered from a lack of investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is pushing forward efforts to revive the local economies of Detroit, Cleveland, Youngstown, Ohio, and other areas where homes can sell for as little as a few thousand dollars but typically require a lot of work to fix up and can't be financed with a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. ZIP Codes where the median home cost less than $100,000 in early 2018 have had a 42% rise in prices in the three years since, according to a <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>. analysis for The Wall Street Journal. That is about double the rise for ZIP Codes where the median was between $150,000 and $200,000, and triple the rise in locales with $300,000-plus price tags.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pandemic has prompted wealthy buyers to splurge on vacation homes and families to trade in city living for the suburbs. It has also fueled demand among first-time home buyers and investors, lifting the bottom end of the housing market in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices in many low-cost areas remain far below national averages, some worry that the price appreciation either won't last or won't reach the residents who stand to benefit most. The rising prices could also lock some families out of homeownership, especially young people and first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear if the recent rise "is a sign of upward and sustainable wealth accumulation for low-income and minority households," said Karen Petrou, author of "Engine of Inequality: The Fed and the Future of Wealth in America."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, community advocates see signs that neighborhood revitalization is spreading to those previously lacking signs of economic life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Jordan Jr., a general contractor, browsed Zillow listings last year across Youngstown. He was looking for a fixer-upper that he could rehab and flip but scoffed at listing prices of between $30,000 and $40,000 for homes in bad shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he turned to the Mahoning County Land Bank, which manages and sells vacant properties in town to those willing to fix them up. He spent $3,000 in September for a house in a rundown neighborhood east of downtown, where the other properties on the block were largely vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He redid the plumbing and got rid of the mold. He pulled out the old carpets and painted the walls, all of which he estimates cost him about $5,000. With the house in better shape, he decided to move in. He is selling his other house on the city's north side. "My decision was more economic," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often, an investment in this price range means sinking more money into buying and fixing up a property than it can ultimately fetch upon sale. At Youngstown Neighborhood Development Corp., a nonprofit that rehabs properties and focuses on neighborhood revitalization, the price increases lessen the risk of this pitfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Detroit's cheapest ZIP Code, where the median sales price was $45,500 in early 2018, prices have since risen 113%, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. That is far more than any other ZIP Code in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is leading to shifts across Detroit, which has thousands of vacant properties. The Detroit Land Bank Authority, which manages these homes, sold 1,091 of them in the first three months of the year, more than double that of a year earlier. Increased demand has prompted the land bank to scrap plans to demolish about 300 houses, according to Rob Linn, director of inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values across Detroit rose 24% in the 12 months through April, Zillow said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tekeela Daniels, a specialist at a <span class="companylink">Stellantis NV</span> manufacturing plant, started working with a real-estate agent in November to find a house. But all of them were either in undesirable neighborhoods or too small. She has been outbid on land-bank properties a handful of times in recent months. Homes on auction typically start at $1,000, but Ms. Daniels has lost out to bidders offering tens of thousands of dollars, she said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices rose nearly everywhere in the first quarter, a rapid price appreciation that shows little sign of fading soon with limited housing inventory and robust demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for existing single-family homes was higher in the quarter compared with a year earlier for 182 of the 183 metro areas tracked by the National Association of Realtors, the group said Tuesday. In 89% of those metro areas, median prices rose by more than 10% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week's price data were the latest confirmation that the pandemic continues to reshape how and where many people want to live. Remote work prompted buyers to seek out more space, while pandemic-related restrictions made vacation houses more desirable, real-estate agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing boom has been unusually widespread, with low mortgage rates fueling strong buyer interest across the U.S., especially for high-end properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first-time buyers in particular have struggled to keep up with soaring prices, and those with limited budgets are often losing out to cash buyers. The length of time U.S. homeowners stay put, meanwhile, has been steadily rising. Some have decided not to move, or they postponed selling because of concerns about letting buyers into their homes during a pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shortage of homes on the market is affecting home shoppers around the country. The number of active listings on Realtor.com was down 52% from a year earlier in the week ended May 1. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, parent of The Wall Street Journal, operates Realtor.com.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The record-high home prices are happening across nearly all markets, big and small, even in those metros that have long been considered off the radar in prior years for many home seekers," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rose in 2020 to the highest level since 2006 and remained strong in the first quarter. Economists have said the current housing boom is less risky than the one in the mid-2000s that ended with a crash. Borrowers this time are more financially qualified, and mortgage lenders are maintaining tighter standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, brokers describe the current market as frenzied. Many homes receive multiple offers within days. The typical home that sold in March spent 18 days on the market, the fastest pace on record, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have said the pace of price increases is likely to slow later in the year and next as more people are priced out of the market, especially if mortgage rates tick higher. Mortgage-finance company <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> is forecasting median existing-home prices to rise 11.5% in 2021, then slow to a 4% increase in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With low inventory already impacting the market, added skyrocketing costs have left many families facing the reality of being priced out entirely," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the metro areas that posted the strongest price increases in the first quarter were vacation destinations, as second-home demand surged during the pandemic and continues to remain robust. The biggest gainer was Kingston, N.Y., with a 35.5% median-price increase from a year earlier. Kingston is in New York's Hudson Valley, where many city dwellers temporarily or permanently moved in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only metro area to post a decline in the first quarter from a year earlier was Springfield, Ill., where median prices fell 2.4%, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Boise, Idaho, metro area, where median home prices surged 32.8%, Julie Cook struggled to find a house within her budget. She and her mother moved to Boise from Florida in January. Ms. Cook had looked at house listings before she moved and planned to buy a house in Boise for under $300,000. But by the time she arrived, there was little that amount could buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cook ended up purchasing a townhouse for $330,000 in March. "It's really not my dream or anything," she said. "But I felt like I needed to, for mine and my mom's sake, find a place that we could afford."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the median existing-home sales price rose 16.2% in the first quarter to $319,200, a record high in data going back to 1989, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are rising so rapidly they are outweighing the benefit of rock-bottom borrowing rates. In the first quarter, the typical monthly mortgage payment rose to $1,067, from $995 a year earlier, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said, even as mortgage rates declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many metro areas, demand would still exceed the available supply even if some buyers dropped out, real-estate executives said. "Despite an 11% increase in our average sales price over the last year, demand for our homes has never been higher," said Eric Lipar, chief executive of home builder LGI Homes Inc., in an earnings call this month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year of the pandemic saw the largest increase in global house prices since the U.S. housing boom of the mid-2000s. And there is no sign the rally is coming to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That provides immediate economic support for the global recovery from Covid-19. But a prolonged house-price upswing would mean big new problems for financial stability. And it could result in economic strife if middle-class citizens accustomed to a one-way housing bet suddenly find the rug pulled out from beneath them down the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices rose by 4.91% across 16 economies monitored by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</span> last year, the sharpest increase since 2006. The move was large by the standards of a normal year -- but explosive in the context of a global economic contraction of around 3.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the trend shows little sign of abating. The U.S. housing market is millions of homes short of buyer demand. Prices have climbed in places as varied as the eurozone, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Booming prices reflect a major difference between the liftoff from the financial crisis of 2008 and the nascent post-pandemic boom. The financial crisis emanated from a fragile, undercapitalized banking sector: The obvious postcrisis response was to lend much more conservatively. But at the beginning of last year, banks were far less overextended and, with greater government support, were much more rapidly able to pass on interest-rate cuts to borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, banks are far more exposed to housing markets than they once were. Across 18 advanced economies, mortgage lending has grown from around a third of total bank lending in 1960 to very nearly 60%. The financial crisis seems to have been only a brief speed bump in this secular trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experience of countries that didn't have a major banking crisis in 2008 shows what could happen on a far larger scale now. Most countries with large run-ups in household debt during the last decade -- China, South Korea, Thailand, Canada and Sweden -- were places where banks didn't suffer in 2008. And rather than the brief, one-off increase in leverage of the kind many analysts expect following the pandemic today, household borrowing climbed continually over the following decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many such countries have attempted to slow down rapid increases in house prices. The Korean government has enacted dozens of individual tweaks to tax and lending regulations. The latest Canadian federal budget announced a tax on vacant and underused property owned by foreigners, following existing levies in Vancouver and Toronto. So far, few measures have had an impact large enough to stall the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, Swedish central-bank governor Stefan Ingves compared the household debt situation to sitting on a volcano. The analogy is apt, given how sensitive the health of economies is to increased leverage among households in particular. Economists Atif Mian, Amir Sufi and Emil Verner have published research demonstrating that burgeoning household debt tends to slow down economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not to say there's nothing to be done. There have been a small number of successes in controlling and preventing house-price booms to note. They bear much closer examination for policy makers in the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's case is the most obvious. The country's lack of zoning restrictions and rent controls are regularly credited with the country's flat home prices, particularly in Tokyo, where the total population is still increasing. All the same, making fair international comparisons is difficult because interest rates have been so much lower than other parts of the world for so much longer, and overall economic growth has been so weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a study published in the Journal of Housing Economics in 2018, Singapore's flurry of efforts to cool house prices between 2009 and 2013 also seems to have helped to stall the country's buoyant house-price growth. The measures included higher taxes on home-flipping, higher deposit requirements for second-time buyers, longer residential-loan terms, and caps on the amount of a borrower's income that could be spent on home loan repayments. But Singapore is also an example of how difficult such progress is to defend: Prices jumped to a record in the first quarter of the year. And Singapore's market is unique in other respects -- the lion's share of housing is publicly developed for Singaporeans to purchase, and homeownership rates are among the highest in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other areas to look at. Outright taxes on the value of houses, the land beneath them, or both are popular with economists but have yet to find their way into public policy in most parts of the world. Even without such radical steps, fixing other positive biases housing receives in tax systems around the world would be a good start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dealing with an asset that is a totemic symbol of middle-class security and the main source of household wealth, but is also a major financial stability risk, is an unenviable task for policy makers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with many parts of the world already in the foothills of a new house-price boom, it's an issue that must be considered urgently if they want to avoid the mistakes of the past.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A chart titled "Inventory" with a Journal Report article on Wednesday about home purchases showed how long it would take, in number of months, to sell the current inventory of homes on the market at the current sales rate.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a complex time to be a young home buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are near-historic lows, which is luring many people -- including first-time buyers -- into the housing market. In 2020, sales of previously owned homes surged to their highest level in 14 years, and many economists forecast sales to rise again this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the supply of homes is tight, and new construction can't keep up with demand -- which means that buyers often have to fork over a staggering amount to close a deal. U.S. house prices soared 12.2% in February from a year earlier, the biggest annual increase in data going back to 1991, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For millennials who are looking for a home, this means a tough calculation. Many of them have limited funds and are carrying a lot of debt. So, is it worth stretching their resources to buy a more expensive house if they can lock in a lower mortgage rate for years to come?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or should they wait until housing prices cool down to more affordable levels -- and risk having mortgage rates rise in the meantime? Already, rates recently hit their highest level since June, and many economists expect them to continue creeping upward this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debating the issue are Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate and finance at the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School</span>, and Laurie Goodman, vice president for housing finance policy and the founder of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">YES:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest Rates Are Low and Housing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices Are Unlikely to Come Down</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">----</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Laurie Goodman
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates are at near-historic lows. There have been only eight months in the past 50 years when rates were lower than they are now -- and those eight months were all during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why this is an ideal time for young people to stretch themselves financially to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home prices have increased dramatically over the past year, and might seem high by historical standards, they're unlikely to come down, as houses are in short supply. Interest rates, meanwhile, are likely to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young people who want to become homeowners should take advantage of the situation to lock in their mortgage payments for the next 30 years, essentially inflation-proofing their housing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having a stable housing situation is crucial. Landlords can raise the rent to an unaffordable level or refuse to renew the lease for any number of reasons. If young people remain renters, they can expect their housing costs to go up each year, perhaps faster than the rate of inflation, especially given the tight housing supply. Even if a mortgage payment is a stretch for young people today, they will grow into the payment, as their income is likely to rise over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's another crucial advantage to homeownership: It remains the best way to build long-term wealth. Even though many young people saw their parents go through the great financial crisis, with home values down 25% from the 2006 peak to the trough in 2012, home values are up 73% since the 2012 lows and are 29% above the previous peak, according to Urban Institute calculations based on data from mortgage-technology and data firm Black Knight. Bidding wars are erupting in many markets because of low supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some argue that the current appreciation rate in home values is unsustainable. But the housing-supply shortage and production of new units that is low by historical standards suggest that values will continue to rise. And even if the rate of appreciation slackens, home buyers can still see strong returns on their investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New borrowers, on average, put down about 5% of the home's cost, financing the balance with a mortgage. If the borrower puts down 5%, or $10,000, on a $200,000 home, and the home increases a modest 3% annually, the home would be worth $231,854 after five years. The five-year return on the borrower's $10,000 investment is 316% -- a figure that you're unlikely to get with a $10,000 stock-market investment. The earlier a young person can stretch to access homeownership, the more time they will have to accrue the benefits of this leveraged investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, homeownership isn't the best option for everyone. There are transaction costs, in the range of about 8% -- 5% for buying and selling the home and 3% for various mortgage closing costs and expenses. This suggests homeownership isn't ideal for people who intend to move within a year or two, as the transaction costs outweigh the wealth-building benefits. But geographic mobility has been declining, with millennials moving less often than their parents did at the same age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some may also say that we're heading for a debt bubble -- a big driver of the last housing collapse. But mortgage debt is way down, and other debt is nowhere near the levels it was before the 2007-09 recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, critics bring up a potentially huge downside to buying a home: If a financial crisis hits and you get laid off, you might miss your mortgage payments and stand to lose your house. But even if you do lose your job, you're not stuck. In most recessions, home prices don't decline -- so you will likely be able to sell your home without taking a loss and downsize to a less-expensive one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bottom line: If a young person interested in homeownership has the opportunity to buy a home in this low-interest-rate environment, they should do so. There is no guarantee that interest rates will stay this low for long, and the earlier homeowners start building equity, the better.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NO:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, Rates Are Low. But Don't Count</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Home Prices Continuing to Rise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">----</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Susan Wachter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates, under 3% for most of the year, continue to remain below levels not seen since the 1950s. Amid these low rates, Covid-19's acceleration of the adoption of remote technology means that young home buyers have more freedom to move to areas where they can work from homes that are more affordable and offer a higher quality of life. It also means young home buyers may be inclined to financially stretch themselves to take advantage of these once-in-a-generation rates. That would be a mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeownership is a proven wealth-building asset, and a way to avoid rent inflation, and a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at today's low rates is generally a safe product. And prices today are rising at a rate of 12%, the highest rate since 2006. But stretching financially and taking on the risk of not being able to pay the mortgage means young buyers are betting on housing prices continuing to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates and tech-driven demand are fueling the blistering rate of housing-price increases, but this past year's appreciation rate isn't sustainable. Future volatility cannot be ruled out if, for example, interest rates and mortgage rates rise. It is a seller's market now due to these significant demand drivers facing historically low inventory and high construction costs, as well as a limited supply of developable land. Still, a seller's market can shift to a buyer's market quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the experience of a decade ago shows, housing prices can plummet -- and fast. Upward price pressures can be incorporated into expectations, which make dramatic drops in price rises more likely when expectations reverse. In the 2007-09 recession, more than eight million households lost their homes to foreclosure in a systemic crisis brought on by overleveraging, according to data and analytics firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price bubble before the financial recession was driven by a debt bubble, giving credence to caution by new home buyers to avoid overextending their borrowing and payback capacity. This is an issue for younger buyers who have other debt, such as student loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By treating housing like any other financial asset, a homeowner neglects the reality that, in an adverse scenario where they cannot repay their mortgage, they stand to lose more than an investment; they stand to lose their creditworthiness and their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stretching to borrow can seem like the right thing to do, to take advantage of low rates, especially when young buyers think about all the years they have to both pay down the mortgage and to increase their earnings. But buyer's remorse can take over if and when housing prices plummet, especially if this occurs along with a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recession, loss of jobs and housing-price declines can both make it impossible to pay back your mortgage and can wipe out your equity. The loss of a job for even one jobholder in a household can make it difficult to pay back the mortgage. A recession is likely to see more distressed sales as a result. These sales, in turn, can weigh on the housing market, causing prices to fall, making it more difficult to recover equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the worsening outlook can lead to negative feedback loops as price declines undermine household wealth, and the financial sector itself is exposed to mortgage losses and pulls back on lending, and both worsen the economic outlook. Younger households have more financial burdens and less current earnings and would be less likely to be able to weather this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the pandemic, housing prices have outperformed many investments, and in the long run, ownership is a means of building wealth. But stretching to buy a house or to buy too expensive a house may put the young homeowner in a precarious position. Ultimately, the notion of stretching one's means to take advantage of low interest rates or other affordable lending products will continue to be a gamble with potentially devastating impacts to the young home buyer and the overall economy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory chart shows how long the current inventory of homes for sale would last given the current sales rate, if no additional new houses were built, in months. An earlier version of the article incorrectly said it was showing the number of homes available for sale. (Corrected on May 6.) Additionally, the cost of a home chart shows inflation-adjusted index of residential properties in the U.S. An earlier version of the chart showed housing prices that were incorrectly labeled at inflation adjusted. (Corrected on May 17.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a complex time to be a young home buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are near-historic lows, which is luring many people—including first-time buyers—into the housing market. In 2020, sales of previously owned homes surged to their highest level in 14 years, and many economists forecast sales to rise again this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the supply of homes is tight, and new construction can't keep up with demand—which means that buyers often have to fork over a staggering amount to close a deal. U.S. house prices soared 12.2% in February from a year earlier, the biggest annual increase in data going back to 1991, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For millennials who are looking for a home, this means a tough calculation. Many of them have limited funds and are carrying a lot of debt. So, is it worth stretching their resources to buy a more expensive house if they can lock in a lower mortgage rate for years to come?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or should they wait until housing prices cool down to more affordable levels—and risk having mortgage rates rise in the meantime? Already, rates recently hit their highest level since June, and many economists expect them to continue creeping upward this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debating the issue are Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate and finance at the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School</span>, and Laurie Goodman, vice president for housing finance policy and the founder of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">YES: Interest rates are low and housing prices are unlikely to come down</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Laurie Goodman 
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates are at near-historic lows. There have been only eight months in the past 50 years when rates were lower than they are now—and those eight months were all during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why this is an ideal time for young people to stretch themselves financially to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home prices have increased dramatically over the past year, and might seem high by historical standards, they're unlikely to come down, as houses are in short supply. Interest rates, meanwhile, are likely to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young people who want to become homeowners should take advantage of the situation to lock in their mortgage payments for the next 30 years, essentially inflation-proofing their housing costs. Having a stable housing situation is crucial. Landlords can raise the rent to an unaffordable level or refuse to renew the lease for any number of reasons. If young people remain renters, they can expect their housing costs to go up each year, perhaps faster than the rate of inflation, especially given the tight housing supply. Even if a mortgage payment is a stretch for young people today, they will grow into the payment, as their income is likely to rise over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's another crucial advantage to homeownership: It remains the best way to build long-term wealth. Even though many young people saw their parents go through the great financial crisis, with home values down 25% from the 2006 peak to the trough in 2012, home values are up 73% since the 2012 lows and are 29% above the previous peak, according to Urban Institute calculations based on data from mortgage-technology and data firm Black Knight. Bidding wars are erupting in many markets because of low supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising Values</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some argue that the current appreciation rate in home values is unsustainable. But the housing-supply shortage and production of new units that is low by historical standards suggest that values will continue to rise. And even if the rate of appreciation slackens, home buyers can still see strong returns on their investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New borrowers, on average, put down about 5% of the home's cost, financing the balance with a mortgage. If the borrower puts down 5%, or $10,000, on a $200,000 home, and the home increases a modest 3% annually, the home would be worth $231,854 after five years. The five-year return on the borrower's $10,000 investment is 316%—a figure that you're unlikely to get with a $10,000 stock-market investment. The earlier a young person can stretch to access homeownership, the more time they will have to accrue the benefits of this leveraged investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower debt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, homeownership isn't the best option for everyone. There are transaction costs, in the range of about 8%—5% for buying and selling the home and 3% for various mortgage closing costs and expenses. This suggests homeownership isn't ideal for people who intend to move within a year or two, as the transaction costs outweigh the wealth-building benefits. But geographic mobility has been declining, with millennials moving less often than their parents did at the same age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some may also say that we're heading for a debt bubble—a big driver of the last housing collapse. But mortgage debt is way down right now, and other debt is nowhere near the levels it was before the 2007-09 recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, critics bring up a potentially huge downside to buying a home: If a financial crisis hits and you get laid off, you might miss your mortgage payments and stand to lose your house. But even if you do lose your job, you're not stuck. In most recessions, home prices don't decline—so you will likely be able to sell your home without taking a loss and downsize to a less-expensive one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bottom line: If a young person interested in homeownership has the opportunity to buy a home in this low-interest-rate environment, they should do so. There is no guarantee that interest rates will stay this low for long, and the earlier homeowners start building equity, the better.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NO: Rates are low, but don't count on home prices continuing to rise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Susan Wachter </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates, under 3% for most of the year, continue to remain below levels not seen since the 1950s. Amid these low rates, Covid-19's acceleration of the adoption of remote technology means that young home buyers have more freedom to move to areas where they can work from homes that are more affordable and offer a higher quality of life. It also means young home buyers may be inclined to financially stretch themselves to take advantage of these once-in-a-generation rates. That would be a mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeownership is a proven wealth-building asset, and a way to avoid rent inflation, and a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at today's low rates is generally a safe product. And prices today are rising at a rate of 12%, the highest rate since 2006. But stretching financially and taking on the risk of not being able to pay the mortgage means young buyers are betting on housing prices continuing to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not sustainable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates and tech-driven demand are fueling the blistering rate of housing-price increases, but this past year's appreciation rate isn't sustainable. Future volatility cannot be ruled out if, for example, interest rates and mortgage rates rise. It is a seller's market now due to these significant demand drivers facing historically low inventory and high construction costs, as well as a limited supply of developable land. Still, a seller's market can shift to a buyer's market quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the experience of a decade ago shows, housing prices can plummet—and fast. Upward price pressures can be incorporated into expectations, which make dramatic drops in price rises more likely when expectations reverse. In the 2007-09 recession, more than eight million households lost their homes to foreclosure in a systemic crisis brought on by overleveraging, according to data and analytics firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The frenzied climb in lumber prices is generating superlative profits for sawmill owners. Home buyers, renters and do-it-yourselfers are footing the bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wood prices pushed further into record territory, a sign that <span class="companylink">Weyerhaeuser Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Canfor Corp</span>. and other sawmill owners are in line for even fatter profits than the record earnings they have been reporting for the first three months of 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These companies have emerged as the biggest beneficiaries of the wood boom[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/lumber-prices-are-soaring-tree-growers-miserable-11614177282]. They are feasting on a glut of cheap pine trees[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/thousands-of-southerners-planted-trees-for-retirement-it-didnt-work-1539095250] in the U.S. South while their finished products like lumber and plywood are flying off hardware-store shelves and being bid up by home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber futures delivery later this month ended Monday at $1,575.60 per thousand board feet, a record and more than four times the typical price this time of year. Futures rose by the daily maximum allowed by the <span class="companylink">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</span> during nine of April's 21 trading sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exchange rules remove daily trading thresholds during the month in which a futures contract expires, which means May futures have no limit to how high they may rise before the 15th, when the bets are settled. On Monday, May futures shot up $75.60, the most ever in a single day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On-the-spot prices for two-by-fours and other wood products also have jumped to fresh highs, according to pricing service Random Lengths. Traders worried about being left empty-handed capitulated, and the firm's framing-lumber-composite price made its highest ever weekly gain, ending April at a record of $1,290.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nervousness on the part of many traders was palpable, as they considered what the downside of the run might look like," Random Lengths said in its weekly report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mill owners say they are backed up with orders into June. Boards for July delivery, the most actively traded futures contract, ended Monday at $1,418.50. September lumber cost $1,277.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Absent a significant increase in mortgage rates or a Covid resurgence, it is hard to imagine what could cause lumber demand to drop and prices to moderate in the foreseeable future," said Eric Cremers, chief executive of PotlatchDeltic Corp., which owns timberland and mills in Idaho, Arkansas, Michigan and Minnesota. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Spokane, Wash., company's wood-products division earned $125.5 million during the first quarter, its best ever. Lumber futures have risen by about two-thirds from the $890 average price that <span class="companylink">Potlatch</span> fetched during the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders are reporting record home sales, and they're going to need that wood to build those homes," Mr. Cremers told investors and analysts last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To emphasize how tight supplies have gotten for many wood products, the CEO told them about his own fence, which blew over in a storm, and the landscaper who had to drive 100 miles out of town to find cedar posts to fix it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. wood product output returned to pre-pandemic levels in December, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The prices appear to be passing on," Canfor CEO Don Kayne told investors Friday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders including <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. and the <span class="companylink">Howard Hughes Corp</span>. say they have offset higher prices for lumber as well as for other building materials[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/commodities-boom-hits-home-11615973404] by raising home prices without slowing sales. <span class="companylink">NexPoint Residential Trust Inc</span>. investment chief Matthew McGraner assured shareholders that high lumber prices weren't eating into the apartment owner's margins. "Any additional costs, we've been able to pass on to the tenants," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a recent investor conference, Lowe's Cos. finance chief David Denton said the home-improvement chain and its rivals weren't waiting to see if the run-up in lumber prices would be short-lived before raising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That largely gets passed on pretty much real-time into the marketplace and you're seeing that across the industry," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lakeside city of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, tops the list of the country's hottest emerging housing markets, according to the ranking. The Wall Street Journal/Realtor.com Emerging Housing Market Index ranks the 300 biggest metro areas in the U.S. The rankings[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/emerging-housing-markets-index-wsj-realtor-com-11619483158]look at which housing markets are expected to provide a strong return on investment—and are a nice place to live. After Coeur d'Alene, the top metro areas in the ranking are Austin, Texas, Springfield, Ohio, and Billings, Mont. Spokane, Wash., just across the state border from Coeur d'Alene, ranks fifth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KEY TAKEAWAYS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Buyers from Western states are fleeing congested areas and looking for a bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top metro areas for interest in Coeur d'Alene listings were Seattle, Spokane and Los Angeles. Buyers from those areas are seeking a more rural and less expensive place to live, said Kristen Johnson, a real-estate agent at Century 21 Beutler &amp; Associates in Coeur d'Alene. New residents who recently sold homes in more expensive markets such as Seattle and Los Angeles are often able to buy homes in Coeur d'Alene in cash. Workers able to work remotely are also choosing to relocate, said Ms. Johnson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. The outdoors is a big draw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coeur d'Alene is also a popular second-home and luxury market owing to the area's natural beauty and access to outdoor activities, such as skiing and water sports. Lake Coeur d'Alene and the nearby mountains are draws for people who move to the city. That has helped boost the number of high-end sales. In the first two months of the year, 67 homes in the area sold for $1 million and above, up from 12 sales in that price range in the first two months of 2020, Ms. Williams said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Coeur d'Alene has more relaxed Covid-19-related restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers have been drawn to these relaxed restrictions, said Lea Williams, associate broker at Tomlinson Sotheby's International Realty in Coeur d'Alene. Students in Coeur d'Alene public schools have been able to attend school in person at least part-time all year, according to a spokesman for the school district. The Panhandle Health District lifted a mask mandate for five counties in northern Idaho last month, and Coeur d'Alene's school board voted this month to lift its mask requirement for students and staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Home prices in the top 10 markets in the index have risen 27% on average in the past year, outpacing a 14% nationwide rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10 top areas in the index also had a higher proportion of their home-shopping traffic come from buyers outside those metro areas, compared with the market as a whole, said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. "Home buyers are broadening their search horizons in a way they haven't before," she said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth accelerated to a new 15-year high in February, as home-buying demand remained strong and the number of homes for sale held near a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 12% in the year that ended in February, up from an 11.2% annual rate the prior month. February marked the highest annual rate of price growth since February 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that the homeownership rate inched higher to 65.6% in the first quarter, up from 65.3% a year earlier and slightly down from 65.8% in the fourth quarter. For households headed by someone under 35 years old, a key source of home-buying demand, the homeownership rate rose to 38.1% from 37.3% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for homes has surged in the past year as mortgage interest rates held near record lows. Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of the housing market, rose in 2020 to their highest annual level since 2006, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes for sale fell to a record low in January and stayed at that level in February, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said. Mortgage-finance company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> recently estimated that the U.S. housing market is 3.8 million single-family homes short of what is needed to meet the country's demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 11.7% over the year ended in February, compared with a 10.9% increase in January. The 20-city index rose 11.9%, after an annual gain of 11.1% in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These data remain consistent with the hypothesis that Covid has encouraged potential buyers to move from urban apartments to suburban homes," said Craig Lazzara, managing director and global head of index investment strategy at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix had the fastest home-price growth in the country for the 21st straight month, at 17.4%, followed by San Diego at 17%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate measure of home-price growth by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> also released Tuesday found a 12.2% increase in home prices in February from a year earlier, a record in data going back to 1991.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picturesque lakeside city of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, tops the list of the country's hottest emerging housing markets, according to a new ranking launched Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal/Realtor.com Emerging Housing Markets Index identifies the top metro areas for home buyers seeking an appreciating housing market and appealing lifestyle amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Coeur d'Alene, the top metro areas in the ranking are Austin, Texas; Springfield, Ohio; and Billings, Mont. Spokane, Wash., just across the state border from Coeur d'Alene, ranks fifth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers from other Western states are moving to northern Idaho in droves, seeking a more rural and less expensive place to live, said Kristen Johnson, a real-estate agent at Century 21 Beutler &amp; Associates in Coeur d'Alene. Workers able to work remotely are also choosing to relocate, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even though it's a city, it's definitely got those small-town values," said Erin Evans, who moved in December to Coeur d'Alene from Forest Grove, Ore., after her husband Will got a job at a nearby hospital. "People are friendly. Right now, I'm looking out my window and I see my neighbor's kids playing outside. You feel that it's a little more safe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They bought a three-bedroom house in November that includes a downstairs apartment, which they plan to rent out for extra income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price in the Coeur d'Alene region rose in March to $476,900, up 47% from a year earlier, according to the Coeur d'Alene Association of Realtors. Finding a home to buy in the metro area of about 166,000 is getting tougher: Inventory of homes for sale shrank by 71% to just 337 homes. That amounts to less than a month's supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's not enough to go around -- therefore, every listing gets 30 offers," Ms. Johnson said. "Since the pandemic, our market has been crazy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 70% of page views on Coeur d'Alene property listings came from outside the state in the first quarter, up from about 66% a year earlier, according to Realtor.com. The top metro areas for interest in Coeur d'Alene listings were Seattle, Spokane and Los Angeles.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential real estate is one of the world's most popular investments. In the U.S. alone, the total value of owner-occupied real estate is roughly $32 trillion, nearly as much as the value of the entire U.S. stock market. And you can't live in your stock portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In order to help home buyers decide on the best place to make this important investment, The Wall Street Journal collaborated with Realtor.com[https://www.realtor.com/] to rank which housing markets are expected to provide both a strong return on investment—and are a nice place to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, at the top of the list? Read more about the city here[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/lakeside-idaho-city-is-americas-hottest-housing-market-in-new-wsj-realtor-com-index-11619515802].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While other market-by-market comparisons focus only on housing metrics, the WSJ/Realtor.com Emerging Housing Markets Index also looks at nonhousing indicators to help identify places that are not only good places to invest, but also where you are likely to enjoy living. Initially, the index will be updated quarterly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Methodology</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In order to identify the top emerging housing markets, The Wall Street Journal and Realtor.com reviewed data for the 300 most populous core-based statistical areas, as measured by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>. (Note: The Wall Street Journal and Realtor.com are both owned by parent company <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall methodology explores two main areas: real-estate markets (50%) and economic health (50%). Those two areas comprise eight key indicators:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-Estate Supply (16.6%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures the relative scarcity of real estate for sale in a market compared with others based on real-estate listings' median number of days on the market. Markets with a high supply score have relatively few days on the market compared with other areas. That relatively limited supply is likely to lead to home-price growth. In contrast, markets with a low supply score have more days on the market compared with other areas, indicating that relatively abundant supply will help alleviate pressure on home prices. (Source: Realtor.com. Updated monthly. Current data is March 2021.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What should home buyers look for in an emerging housing market? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-Estate Demand (16.6%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures the relative abundance of real-estate demand in a market compared with other markets based on the average number of unique viewers per real-estate listing. Markets with a high demand score have a relatively large number of unique viewers per home. That abundant buyer demand is likely to lead to home-price growth. In contrast, markets with a low demand score have a smaller number of unique viewers per real-estate listing, indicating that more limited buyer demand will help curb upward pressure on home prices. (Source: Realtor.com. Updated monthly. Current data is March 2021.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median Home Listing Price Trend (16.6%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures recent home-price performance compared with other markets based on typical asking prices for real-estate listings that are active on realtor.com. (Source: Realtor.com. Updated monthly. Current data is March 2021.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment (7.1%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures the relative health of the local job market. Data consists of the estimated percentage of the civilian noninstitutional population 16 years of age and older who were not employed during the reference period. The seasonally adjusted series is used in the index. (Source: <span class="companylink">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>. Updated monthly. Current data is February 2021.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wages (7.1%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures the relative quality of employment in the area in terms of total wages. Data consists of the median usual weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers, before taxes and other deductions, including any overtime pay, commissions or tips. Doesn't include self-employed workers. (Source: <span class="companylink">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>. Updated quarterly. Current data is for the second quarter of 2020.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regional price parities (7.1%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures how expensive it is to live and work in a metro area. RPP consists of differences in price levels across metropolitan areas for a given year, expressed as a percentage of the overall national price level. RPP covers all consumer goods and services, including housing rents. (Source: <span class="companylink">U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis</span>. Updated yearly. Current data is for 2019.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amenities (7.1%)</p>

Data consists of average one-way travel time among workers aged 16 years and older who didn't work from home. (Source: <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>. Updated yearly. Current data is for 2019.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign-born Residents (7.1%)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth accelerated to a new 15-year high in February, as homebuying demand remained strong and the number of homes for sale held near a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 12% in the year that ended in February, up from an 11.2% annual rate the prior month. February marked the highest annual rate of price growth since February 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that the homeownership rate inched higher to 65.6% in the first quarter, up from 65.3% a year earlier and slightly down from 65.8% in the fourth quarter. For households headed by someone under 35 years old, a key source of homebuying demand, the homeownership rate rose to 38.1% from 37.3% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for homes has surged in the past year[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-housing-market-is-crazier-than-its-been-since-2006-11617422403]as mortgage interest rates held near record lows[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/30-year-mortgage-rate-tops-3-for-first-time-since-july-11614870208].

</div><div class="author">By Nick Kostov </div><div>652 words</div><div>22 April 2021</div><div>07:23</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers stuck at home drinking coffee powered <span class="companylink">Nestlé SA</span> to its best quarterly sales growth in almost a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's biggest packaged-food company on Thursday reported a 7.7% rise in first-quarter organic sales, which strip out currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, driven by strong demand for <span class="companylink">Nespresso</span> pods, Nescafé instant coffee and <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>-branded products. That performance handily beat analyst expectations of 3.3% sales growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Nestlé</span> said coffee was the largest contributor to growth, with gains in North America and Europe. <span class="companylink">Nespresso</span> products were particularly popular, with sales rising 17.1%, fueled by market-share gains in North America and demand for its Vertuo coffee machines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the pandemic hit last year, consumers bought whatever coffee they could find as offices closed around the world and they faced shortages at supermarkets. But after months of restrictions, coffee drinkers have invested in espresso machines, French presses and pour-over brewers as they look to upgrade their coffee experience[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/coffee-battleground-during-coronavirus-era-is-your-kitchen-counter-11605004201] and replicate what they were getting in cafes at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We clearly benefited from people enjoying their coffee at home rather than in the office or the cafeteria," a Nestlé spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Swiss company has made coffee a priority in recent years as part of an overhaul to focus on product categories that it says have the strongest growth potential[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/nestle-ceos-vision-takes-shape-but-an-activist-clouds-the-horizon-1538124955], while selling noncore businesses like U.S. confectionary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of its biggest moves[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/nestle-inks-deal-to-sell-starbucks-products-world-wide-1525671469], <span class="companylink">Nestlé</span> in 2018 agreed to pay <span class="companylink">Starbucks Corp</span>. more than $7 billion for the rights to sell the Seattle chain's packaged coffee beans, single-serve coffee packs and other products through retail and grocery stores. It has also gone after young and hip coffee drinkers by acquiring smaller brands, including Austin, Texas-based Chameleon Cold-Brew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month the company said it would invest in the expansion of its <span class="companylink">Nespresso</span> production and distribution centers in Switzerland to meet growing consumer demand world-wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Nestlé</span>'s challenge now, some analysts said, is seeing whether it can keep its pandemic momentum going as some major markets, like the U.S. and U.K., begin to emerge from the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In coffee, the company is rolling out new touchless machines to offer safer cups for workers returning to offices, while trying to retain the boom in at-home consumption with a range of new products and flavors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC, said that while he thought the <span class="companylink">Nespresso</span> numbers were impressive, he didn't think it was the start of a long-term trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That growth isn't sustainable for them," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, <span class="companylink">Nestlé</span> has performed well over the past year as consumers stuck at home splurged on familiar foods from big brands[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/shoppers-stock-up-on-comfort-food-amid-pandemic-11587726462] for them and their pets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter, the maker of Nesquik cereal, Friskies cat food and Häagen-Dazs ice cream posted strong sales in dairy products, led by demand for home baking products and fortified milk, as well as pet care, which has been on a tear over the past year[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/pet-food-sales-soar-boosting-nestle-and-luring-other-players-11581594832].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">E-commerce was another bright spot, with sales, fueled by <span class="companylink">Nespresso</span> products, rising 40% to reach one-sixth of group sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Nestlé</span> also flagged signs of recovery in its out-of-home business, selling to places like restaurants and hotels, as pandemic restrictions ease in some parts of the world. China was its best selling region in the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's first-quarter sales were also boosted by higher selling prices, up 1.2%, to cover rising commodity costs. Other consumer products companies have also flagged price rises[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/procter-gamble-will-raise-prices-in-september-11618916498], including <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble Co</span>. earlier this week.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eun-Young Jeong in Seoul and Dan Strumpf in Hong Kong | Photographs by Gabby Jones for The Wall Street Journal </div><div>2340 words</div><div>19 April 2021</div><div>11:08</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's leading suppliers of semiconductors are pushing to overcome the prolonged chip shortage that has hampered production of everything from home appliances to PCs to autos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chip makers are trying to eke out more supply through changes to manufacturing processes and by opening up spare capacity to rivals, auditing customer orders to prevent hoarding and swapping over production lines. The bad news is, there are no quick fixes, and shortages will likely continue into next year, according to the industry's executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of a spike in demand, producers have been hamstrung by a series of freak events that have knocked out supply, while ongoing U.S.-China political frictions and concerns of a prolonged shortage have prompted some manufacturers to stockpile chips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current shortfall includes the less-advanced chips that the industry's biggest players have been pulling away from to pursue higher-margin, cutting-edge chips. Building new production capacity usually takes years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could slow down the post-pandemic recovery for certain industries that use the chips that are looking to take advantage of rising consumer spending. It also feeds into inflation concerns as higher chip costs can stoke prices throughout the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Racing to fill orders, <span class="companylink">GlobalFoundries Inc</span>., based in Santa Clara, Calif., one of the world's largest contract chip manufacturers, is dispatching its engineers to find ways to squeeze out even the smallest amount of extra production from its factories in the U.S., Singapore and Germany. Among the solutions: delaying certain maintenance tasks and speeding up—by a fraction—the rate at which wafers move along the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're working immensely hard to figure out how to do more, build more," said chief executive Thomas Caulfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Tuesday, President Biden called for a bipartisan push to strengthen the U.S. semiconductor industry[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/biden-touts-infrastructure-proposal-in-chip-shortage-meeting-11618253271] during a meeting with automotive and tech executives. He has earmarked $50 billion to boost America's semiconductor production as part of a $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan. The spending isn't expected to push the needle far: making the U.S. self-sufficient for its chips would require more than $1.4 trillion in investments and government incentives over a decade, according to the <span class="companylink">Semiconductor Industry Association</span>, an industry group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chip makers can add only incremental boosts to capacity from existing plants, executives say. Building a new fabrication plant can take years because of the scale and complexity of equipment and space needed to make semiconductors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major chip makers made big strategic bets on the more-profitable advanced chips needed for things such as 5G and servers. The approach hit a glitch when the coronavirus plunged the global economy into one of its worst recessions, rattling supply chains and consumer spending patterns. That left chip makers ill-equipped to deal with the high demand for older, less-sophisticated semiconductors used widely in products such as cars, computer monitors, speakers and appliances—products that have been hoovered up during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply crunch was exacerbated by U.S.-China trade tensions, especially during the past year, including Washington policies that gradually restricted the sale of American-designed or -made chips to some Chinese buyers[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-blacklists-chinas-top-chip-maker-escalating-tech-fight-11608274932]. Fears of sanctions prompted tech companies in China to stockpile chips and prepare for the worst, Huawei Technologies Co. deputy chairman Eric Xu said last week. The Chinese company uses a range of chips in its telecommunication products and consumer gadgets, and aggressively stockpiled components to protect against U.S. export restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now [the Chinese companies] are stockpiling for one month, three months, or even six months, and they have disrupted the whole system," Mr. Xu said. China's semiconductor imports soared 15% last year and hit a record $35.9 billion in March, Chinese customs figures show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chip production was disrupted by events including a plant fire in Japan[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/renesas-chip-plant-fire-spreads-concerns-about-global-auto-production-11616414181] and freezing weather in the southern U.S. that shuttered production lines. A drought in Taiwan, a major chip-making hub[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-chip-shortage-is-bad-taiwans-drought-threatens-to-make-it-worse-11618565400], threatens to further reduce the industry's output, since large amounts of water are used in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers of products that use chips are stepping up production in expectation of a post-pandemic economic recovery. The surge in chip demand is pushing up prices and extending already historically long wait times. Auto makers including Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Co. have been forced to idle or reduce production[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/gm-to-halt-production-at-several-north-american-plants-due-to-chip-shortage-11617893417] at some plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers say they face delays of half a year or longer. "You ask on Monday, it's a 12-week lead time. Then you ask on Wednesday and it's a 27-week lead time," said Liam Bates, chief executive officer of Kaiterra, a Swiss-based maker of air-quality tracking devices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kaiterra, which manufactures in southern China, is beefing up contingency plans to make its supply chain "future-proof." Engineers who focus on building new products now allocate a chunk of time to redesigning existing ones to operate on different chips, in case the ones needed don't arrive. Recently, the company decided to stock up a year's worth of inventory for some parts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Semiconductors are the lifeblood of many industries—ranking as the world's fourth-most traded product counting imports and exports, after crude oil, refined oil and cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, the world's biggest chip makers plowed investment into capacity to feed demand for the next generation of semiconductors, and shifted their focus away from the production of more-basic chips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But autos and home electronics are packed with lots of the more rudimentary components. These include power-management chips, a basic chip that regulates the flow of electricity in a device, and microcontrollers, the workhorses that run a host of functions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There isn't an electronic device that doesn't have a microcontroller in it," <span class="companylink">GlobalFoundries</span>' Mr. Caulfield said. "This is pervasively in short supply."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even advanced electronic gadgets need some basic chips to operate, and in fact increasingly use more of them to run more sophisticated technology. A typical 5G smartphone can hold as many as eight power-management chips, compared with two to three in a 4G phone, according to Hui He, an analyst at research firm Omdia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, 27% of all spending on chip-making equipment went to tools for building the industry's most-advanced chips, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Gartner Inc</span>., which are often used in smartphones, high-end PCs and data centers. Less than half that portion, about 11%, went to equipment for cranking out more commoditized chips</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's largest contract chip maker, <span class="companylink">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co</span>., told investors in January that it is working with customers to upgrade some of the chips they are using so that they can be built on its more-advanced manufacturing lines, where there is more capacity. On Thursday, executives told investors that customers have been stockpiling[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/tsmc-sets-up-for-soaring-chip-demand-11618486965] higher levels of inventory due to the pandemic and geopolitical tensions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Switching existing production lines from making one type of chip to another isn't easy because different types of chips require different equipment to make, though there can be some overlap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There hasn't been a time when the shortage has affected so many types and brands of chips all at once, said Marcus Chen, vice president of sales for the Asia-Pacific at Fusion Worldwide, one of the many global distributors who act as middlemen to supply electronic components to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It usually takes at least two years to build and equip a semiconductor fabrication plant, known as a "fab," which can cost billions of dollars. The most advanced machines that can be installed in the plants can top $100 million and are so large they require as many as three 747s to deliver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once fabs are built, a chip typically takes three months to make—or longer for the most-advanced ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Semiconductor makers must decide whether to make multibillion-dollar bets on whether this surge will last or taper off by the time new plants are up and running. Many are reluctant to alter long-term spending plans based on demand surges that could be short-lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the biggest semiconductor companies are setting aside huge sums to boost overall capacity. TSMC earlier this month unveiled the industry's largest-ever investment[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/tsmc-to-invest-100-billion-to-increase-semiconductor-output-11617281721], allocating $100 billion over the next three years to boost capacity. Most of the company's near-term spending, however, will go toward building the most-advanced chips. In the U.S., <span class="companylink">Intel Corp</span>. last month pledged $20 billion for two sites in Arizona and signaled further investment commitments are to come this year. South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. has earmarked $116 billion in investment by 2030 to diversify chip production[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/samsung-plans-long-term-investment-to-diversify-chip-strategy-11556113382].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China, President Xi Jinping has for years made the country's independence in advanced technologies such as chips a national priority. Yet the goal remains elusive. One key player in the country's self-reliance push defaulted[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinese-chip-maker-in-default-on-2-5-billion-of-dollar-bonds-11607593266] on billions of dollars in debt. Others have been hobbled by U.S. export controls restricting access to advanced chip-making technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's biggest chip maker, <span class="companylink">Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp</span>., last month committed $2.35 billion with a government partner to build a new factory focused on older chip-making processes. The company anticipates the new facility to start production next year. But delays in getting new chip-making equipment is an obstacle to increasing output, the Shanghai-based company's co-CEO, Haijun Zhao, told investors in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chip makers are seeing a doubling, if not quadrupling, of delivery times for the machinery required to make semiconductors, said Bruce Kim, chief executive officer at SurplusGlobal Inc., which sells used chip-making equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">GlobalFoundries</span>, Mr. Caulfield said the firm plans to invest $1.4 billion to expand capacity at existing facilities this year, and will likely double that figure next year. Some of his customers have pledged investment capital to secure future capacity, accounting for 30% of the company's capital expenditure this year, he said. Before the pandemic, the number was zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're seeing a lot of customers saying, 'I'm not going to let that happen again, my business is too important,' " Mr. Caulfield said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Intel</span>, Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said the company would make some of its production capacity available to produce chips in particular short supply and needed by auto-component makers. Supply could start improving in six to nine months, Mr. Gelsinger said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guy Eristoff, chief strategy officer at Israel-headquartered foundry Tower Semiconductor Ltd., said chip production can be sped up to 3.5 times the usual time in rare cases by sorting production lines so that high-priority chips pass through quickly. Some equipment can be operated for longer before going into preventive maintenance, though this can come at the cost of lower yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Altogether, these measures mean some chips can be churned out in 30 to 40 days from the usual 120 days, Mr. Eristoff said. But doing so increases overall production times for other chips. The tweaks can at best increase a fab's production capacity by 5% and be sustained for only up to six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are all sorts of little things you can play with," said Mr. Eristoff. "But without buying more equipment, you cannot, in a sustained manner, run that much more than you are running right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppliers are wary that the surge in demand may not last, with panicked buyers increasing order volumes or placing orders with multiple companies. San Jose, Calif.-based <span class="companylink">Broadcom Inc</span>., one of the world's leading chip companies, is trying to ensure orders coming in reflect actual demand. It recently reminded investors that it doesn't allow customers to cancel chip orders[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/broadcoms-no-cancel-culture-11614964024] to deter some buyers from making purchase commitments out of fear of shortages.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good day. The frequency and scale of the Federal Reserve's market interventions is concerning, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said. Federal debt is at an all-time high, but some say the traditional debt-to-GDP ratio is no longer meaningful. Elsewhere, China's economy grew more than 18% in the first quarter, <span class="companylink">Turkey's central bank</span> held rates steady, and some analysts are calling for tighter monetary policy to cool Canada's housing market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daly Says Frequency of Fed Market Interventions Is Concerning</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly is worried that unresolved financial system weaknesses are drawing the U.S. central bank in with emergency support offerings too often. "Without changes to our financial infrastructure, the Federal Reserve may regularly be called to step in to stabilize markets during turbulent periods," she said, adding, "and not just for 100-year floods like Covid-19, but for more typical disruptions associated with average shocks to the global and domestic economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Debt Is at a Record High, but the Risk Calculus Is Changing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the federal government's publicly held debt is projected to hit 102% of U.S. gross domestic product, and the annual deficit is expected to reach $2.3 trillion, or 10.3% of GDP. Traditionally, such eye-popping ratios would trigger fears of skyrocketing inflation and the potential for the government to respond by raising taxes or cutting spending. But it isn't clear what level of debt-to-GDP ratio truly represents fiscal prudence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The debt-to-GDP ratio today can be much higher without the same inflationary consequences or interest-rate consequences because the global demand has been elevated."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Federal Reserve launches a digital currency, or CBDC, it could have seismic implications for the central bank's already massive balance sheet, a <span class="companylink">Bank Policy Institute</span> research paper says. The banking industry group's paper says a Fed CBDC could draw money out of private banks in times of stress. "To prepare for such swings in reserve balances, and to accommodate the potential demand for CBDC, the Federal Reserve would have to maintain a much larger balance sheet in normal times than it does now, possibly more than one-third of GDP," writes Bill Nelson, chief economist at BPI and a former top Fed staffer. The Fed's balance sheet currently stands at $7.7 trillion and U.S. GDP was at $21 trillion last year. While the BPI analysis points to a smaller Fed balance sheet, it suggests the huge size of the Fed's holdings would need to persist well into the future. By contrast, Fed officials hope they will eventually be able to shrink the size of the central bank's holdings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are waiting for <span class="companylink">Zillow Group</span> to tell you when the real-estate market has peaked, you might wait a while. You also may miss the optimal time to sell your home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some U.S. consumers turned to the real-estate market for entertainment last year. The so-called Zillow fantasy led to homes flying off the block in days, with selling times accelerated by low inventory and affordable mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly public Compass, which generates revenue through commissions on home sales, said it grew its top line 56% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the fourth quarter, Redfin said its core business of brokering home sales saw revenue rise 51%, while revenue for its mortgage business grew 210%. In February, Zillow said total visits to its site rose 19% last year, propelling its shares to all-time highs that month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listen to the prophets at real-estate platforms and you might think to double down on your investments. On Wednesday, Zillow said strong demand for homes is likely to continue post-pandemic. Company economist Arpita Chakravorty also noted lowered health risks from open houses and renewed financial confidence should bring even more sellers into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the company forecast existing home sales would rise by more than 17% this year on an annual basis. It also forecast U.S. home value growth won't peak on an annual basis until August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather agrees that many homeowners have been reluctant to sell, either because of Covid-19 or because they haven't had clarity on their future work situation. For those reasons, the end of the pandemic should fuel more home sales, Ms. Fairweather said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors might want to enlist a third opinion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compass shares have lost 14% of their value from when they first traded on April 1 and are now hovering just above their initial offering price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of both Zillow and Redfin have lost roughly 29% of their value since hitting respective February highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerning investors is a combination of low inventory and the rise in mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redfin reported that for the four-week period ended April 4, active listings fell 42% from the same period last year to a new all-time low. Mortgage loan application volume decreased 5% for the week ended April 2 compared with a week earlier as mortgage rates ticked up to the highest level since last June, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jury's also out on whether people who haven't already moved even want to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A February survey by Zillow found that while more people would feel comfortable moving after widespread vaccine distribution, more than half of respondents are already comfortable moving under current health conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Zillow poll of experts was mixed as to whether the pandemic has permanently changed people's living preferences, such as whether they favor smaller or larger cities. Ultimately, Zillow reported no change in the size of Americans' ideal home over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those paying close attention, Zillow has been hedging its bets some. In February, its economists were forecasting existing home sales would rise nearly 25% in 2021 on an annual basis -- a very bullish prediction that has come down by 7.6 percentage points in just a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the momentum the housing market has experienced over the course of the pandemic, it seems unlikely transaction growth will suddenly come to a screeching halt this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But any investor still trading on the predictions of a company in the real-estate advertising business may want to at least broker another source.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>684 words</div><div>15 April 2021</div><div>07:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market is 3.8 million single-family homes short of what is needed to meet the country's demand, according to a new analysis by mortgage-finance company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estimate represents a 52% rise in the nation's home shortage compared with 2018, the first time <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> quantified the shortfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures underscore the severity of the housing deficit, which is a major factor fueling the current red-hot housing market[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-pandemic-ignited-a-housing-boombut-its-different-from-the-last-one-11615824558]. The shortage is especially acute for entry-level homes, which makes it more expensive for first-time home buyers to enter the market, said Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We should have almost four million more housing units if we had kept up with demand the last few years," Mr. Khater said. "This is what you get when you underbuild for 10 years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reached its shortage figure by assessing the amount of single-family home building needed to match demand from household formation, second-home purchases and replacements of damaged or aging U.S. homes, and comparing that with the pace of construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply shortage poses an obstacle to U.S. economic growth, by pushing up housing prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to enter the market and build wealth, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building activity has been subdued since the 2007-09 recession, when many builders went out of business. While builders have increased activity in the past year, they are hampered by shortages of labor[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-boom-brings-a-shortage-of-land-to-build-new-homes-11608904980], materials and developed land[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-boom-brings-a-shortage-of-land-to-build-new-homes-11608904980]. Many builders are pacing their home sales to make sure they don't sell more homes than they can build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts rose last year to 991,000 units, the highest rate since 2007. But starts fell in January and February on a seasonally adjusted basis as construction costs rose, according to Commerce Department data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders would need to construct between 1.1 million and 1.2 million single-family homes a year to meet long-term demand, but the start rate would need to be even higher to shrink the existing deficit, said Rob Dietz, chief economist at the National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> in 2018 estimated that the U.S. was 2.5 million units short of what it needed to meet long-term demand. The new estimate is as of the end of 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the current shortage stems from the pandemic-related moratorium on foreclosures[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/consumer-agency-seeks-to-restrict-foreclosures-through-2021-11617651357], and investors who buy single-family homes[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/if-you-sell-a-house-these-days-the-buyer-might-be-a-pension-fund-11617544801] to rent them out have also played a small role, Mr. Khater said. But the bulk of the shortage is because of home builders not keeping up with long-term demand growth, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, housing demand declines and supply increases during a recession, he said. But the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic is unusual in that it spurred housing demand because higher-income households who were able to work from home wanted more space and were willing to live farther from their offices. At the same time, the pandemic caused supply-chain bottlenecks and permitting delays that slowed new-home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices are rising rapidly as buyers compete for a limited number of homes. In February, there was a two-month supply of homes for sale, near a record low, according to the National Association of Realtors. Median-home prices in the month jumped nearly 16% from a year earlier to $313,000, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mix of newly built homes has also changed, with large, expensive homes making up a greater share of home-building activity. Builders built 65,000 homes smaller than 1,400 square feet in 2020, compared with more than 400,000 such homes annually in the late 1970s, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said.</p>

In February, Zillow said total visits to its site rose 19% last year, propelling its shares to all-time highs that month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listen to the prophets at real-estate platforms, and you might think to double down on your investments. On Wednesday, Zillow said strong demand for homes is likely to continue post-pandemic. Company economist Arpita Chakravorty also noted lowered health risks from open houses and renewed financial confidence should bring even more sellers into the market. In March, the company forecast existing home sales would rise by more than 17% this year on an annual basis. It also forecast U.S. home value growth won't peak on an annual basis until August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redfin seems to be on the same wavelength. Its chief economist, Daryl Fairweather, agrees many homeowners have been reluctant to sell, either because of Covid-19 or because they haven't had clarity on their future work situation. For those reasons, the end of the pandemic should fuel more home sales, Ms. Fairweather said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors might want to enlist a third opinion. Compass shares have lost 15% of their value from when they first traded on April 1 and are now trading just below their initial offering price. Zillow's shares have lost nearly 32% of their value since hitting February highs, while Redfin's shares are off 30% from their own peak that month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerning investors is a combination of low inventory and the rise in mortgage rates, which may deter future buyers from throwing caution to the wind. Redfin reported that for the four-week period ended April 4, active listings fell 42% from the same period last year to a new all-time low. Meanwhile, changing mortgage rates are already having an impact. According to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>, mortgage loan application volume decreased 5% for the week ended April 2 compared with a week earlier as mortgage rates ticked up to the highest level since last June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow surfing continues to be hot, but more recent looks can be deceiving. A recent survey of Zillow users by insurance company Surety First found 55% of respondents are still spending one to four hours browsing on Zillow a day. They aren't there to buy a house, though. Instead, the majority say they are either snooping the value of their boss's or neighbor's home, or else daydreaming about houses they can't actually afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jury's out on whether people who haven't already moved even want to do so. A February survey by Zillow found that while more people would feel comfortable moving after widespread vaccine distribution, more than half of respondents are already comfortable moving under current health conditions. Another Zillow poll of experts was mixed as to whether the pandemic has permanently changed[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/for-newly-remote-workers-small-town-u-s-a-will-lose-its-allure-soon-enough-11592559006] people's living preferences, such as whether they favor smaller or larger cities. Ultimately, Zillow reported no change in the size of Americans' ideal home over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those paying close attention, Zillow itself has been hedging its bets some. In February, its economists were forecasting existing home sales would rise nearly 25% in 2021—a very bullish prediction that has come down by 7.6 percentage points in just a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the momentum the housing market has experienced over the course of the pandemic, it seems unlikely transaction growth will suddenly come to a screeching halt this year. But any investor still trading on the predictions of a company in the real-estate advertising business may want to at least broker another source.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Bender </div><div>626 words</div><div>15 April 2021</div><div>05:40</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERLIN—One of the world's most radical anti-gentrification experiments came to an end on Thursday after Germany's constitutional court declared Berlin's residential rent cap[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/berlin-declares-war-on-gentrification-with-rent-cap-11580397180] void.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision ends months of uncertainty for property owners and renters. Berlin has some of the lowest residential rents of all European capitals but they have also risen very rapidly, nearly doubling over the past decade, persuading the left-wing local government to act last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments from New York City to Paris have introduced measures to control house-price inflation in the era of gentrification. The Covid-19 pandemic—and the stimulus packages, ultralow interest rates and changes in buyer behavior that have come with it—has propelled housing prices even higher[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/house-prices-are-inflating-around-the-world-11616932846] around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Berlin law, passed in February last year, went further than some traditional rent-control legislation by not just freezing rents in the city but also reducing them in many cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an initial stage, the law capped the rent of some 1.5 million Berlin rental apartments, or 90% of all rentals, at June 2019 levels for five years. It then mandated maximum rents for buildings based on their age, allowing tenants who paid more than this level to cut their rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law also banned landlords from increasing rents when renting to new tenants and exposed them to fines of up to €500,000, equivalent to about $599,000, if they didn't comply. Over 80% of Berliners are renters, statistics show, and a recent poll found almost a quarter had managed to cut their rents thanks to the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the court said the law was void because Berlin wasn't allowed to legislate in rent matters where the federal government had already passed legislation. Some 284 lawmakers from the conservative Christian Democratic Union, its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, and business-friendly Free Democrats had challenged its constitutionality before the top German court last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five months before state and federal elections, the court decision deals a blow to Berlin's government, an alliance of Social Democrats, Greens and Socialists, which had made the rent cap its flagship policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also means tenants who had managed to cut their rents could now have to pay back the difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law was controversial from the beginning. Proponents argued it would shore up Berliners' finances and encourage new construction as buildings built after 2014 were exempt from caps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics argued that it would hamper investments in old and new buildings and protect existing tenants, including those with high incomes, to the detriment of new arrivals by increasing the scarcity of rental space in the city's most desirable neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">German Institute for Economic Research</span> (DIW) in a study published earlier this year found that while rental prices fell some 11% in the weeks after the law passed and before the pandemic took hold, rental offers over the same period more than halved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's those who were supposed to benefit, the renters, who are now paying the price for this experiment," said Beatrice Kramm, president of the Berlin chamber of commerce. The rent cap, she said, had led to fewer new constructions, investment freezes and more people competing for apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaders of left-wing party Die Linke called the decision a setback and said they would lobby for the government to set up an emergency fund to help Berliners faced with back payments.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Paul Vieira </div><div>741 words</div><div>15 April 2021</div><div>10:56</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2021, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA—Canada's sizzling housing market shows no signs of slowing as sales in March set a record by a significant margin. The strength in housing is prompting warnings from the Bank of Canada, while some senior economists believe the extraordinary monetary policy launched since the start of the pandemic might now be inappropriate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data released Thursday from the <span class="companylink">Canadian Real Estate Association</span> indicated home sales across Canada climbed 5.2% in March. The over 76,000 residential properties that were bought and sold in March marked the highest level of activity of any month in history, the association said, adding it beat the previous record set last July by 14,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association's house-price index, on a nonadjusted basis, rose 20.13% from a year ago, to 713,700 Canadian dollars, or the equivalent of $569,000. The actual national average sales price, also not seasonally adjusted, climbed more than 31% in March to a record C$716,828, according to the association's data. The national average price is heavily influenced by sales in Canada's two most expensive markets, Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is experiencing a housing craze triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic and the demand for more space, rock-bottom interest rates, and demographics, with millennials moving into their prime-buying years. Yet Canada has seen a more dramatic price run-up than all <span class="companylink">Group of Seven</span> countries, according to housing data collected by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pace of Canadian home sales and prices is simply in uncharted territory," said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. He said sales in March were more than 80% above the March 2019 level, and 66% above the average monthly pace of the past decade, based on available data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate data also indicated new listings in March hit their highest level on record in seasonally adjusted terms. However, inventory across Canada remained at a record low of 1.7 months. The long-term average for this inventory gauge is just over five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bank of Canada said last week that Canadian housing vulnerabilities have increased in recent months amid sharp growth in single-family house prices and rising mortgage debt. Among the concerns the central bank identified was the rapid increase in the share of newly issued mortgages with loan-to-income ratios above 450%—levels last seen in 2017, when Canadian authorities introduced tougher mortgage-financing rules meant to cool activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Canadians don't shy away from housing debt because more people see it not just as an ownership opportunity and store of value, but as a path toward wealth creation that carries less volatility than investing in the stock market," Beata Caranci, chief economist at TD Bank, said in a note to clients Thursday ahead of the housing-data release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the quickest route to cooling this market and squeezing out speculation comes down to interest rates. The Bank of Canada has previously signaled its main policy rate, at 0.25%, will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future. Given the steep drop in mortgage rates in Canada, which is helping fuel housing, the Bank of Canada's "current monetary stance may no longer be appropriate for this segment of the market." Another economist, Derek Holt at <span class="companylink">Bank of Nova Scotia</span>, has also called for a reset in central bank policy, in part because of the country's strong recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bank of Canada is scheduled to issue its next rate decision and economic outlook on April 21. Traders are watching closely for news that <span class="companylink">Canada's central bank</span> will outline plans to scale back, or taper, its large asset purchases that were initiated at the start of the pandemic to help financial markets, and any further commentary or concern about the state of Canadian housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of high-profile economists have called on the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> to introduce measures and consider other potentially controversial policies—including one that no longer exempts the sale of principal residences from capital-gains taxes—to cool real-estate activity, arguing affordability is deteriorating across the country. Canada's Finance Minister, Chrystia Freeland, releases the Liberal government's 2021 budget plan on Monday.</p>

</div><div class="author">By The Editorial Board </div><div>375 words</div><div>7 April 2021</div><div>18:29</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices are climbing across the country, and the cause is more than soaring demand. One overlooked culprit is a lumber shortage made worse by a U.S. tariff on imports from Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S and Canada had a softwood lumber agreement to manage prices with quotas from 2006-2015. When it expired, U.S. lumber producers filed antidumping and countervailing duty complaints. They claim Canada unfairly subsidizes and dumps lumber in the U.S., though in cases Canada has taken to the <span class="companylink">World Trade Organization</span> the U.S. has rarely won. The Trump Commerce Department imposed the tariff in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in metro areas, was up[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-accelerated-in-january-11617109259] 11.2% in the 12 months through January, the highest year-over-year price move in 15 years. Increased demand is part of the story as millennials start families, Americans flee cities, and interest rates remain low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Buildersreported[https://www.nahb.org/advocacy/top-priorities/material-costs/solving-the-lumber-crisis] last month that "unprecedented spikes in lumber prices have added more than $24,000 to the price of the average, new single-family home, and nearly $9,000 to the price of a multifamily home since April 17, 2020." The group blames "insufficient domestic production." Covid-19 has closed sawmills and other production facilities for construction materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian lumber can provide a safety-valve for supply amid U.S. shortages, but not since the tariff. The Commerce Department cut the levy to 9% from 20% in December. But as long as the orders are in place, this lower rate—what importers are mandated to pay in "duty"—is merely a cash deposit for what is due next year. Lumber buyers know Commerce can make a new finding of a higher duty, which would apply retroactively on Canadian lumber they have already imported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This backward-looking assignment of duties introduces enormous uncertainty, creating an incentive to rely on domestic supply. President Biden said as a candidate that he opposes the Trump tariffs on allies. How about killing this one to help American home buyers?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bidding war broke out this winter at a new subdivision north of Houston. But the prize this time was the entire subdivision, not just a single suburban house, illustrating the rise of big investors as a potent new force in the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                        <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. built 124 houses in Conroe, Texas, rented them out and then put the whole community, Amber Pines at Fosters Ridge, on the block. A Who's Who of investors and home-rental firms flocked to the December sale. The winning $32 million bid came from an online property-investing platform Fundrise LLC, which manages more than $1 billion on behalf of about 150,000 individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's most prolific home builder booked about twice what it typically makes selling houses to the middle class -- an encouraging debut in the business of selling entire neighborhoods to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We certainly wouldn't expect every single-family community we sell to sell at a 50% gross margin," the builder's finance chief, Bill Wheat, said at a recent investor conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From individuals with smartphones and a few thousand dollars to pensions and private-equity firms with billions, yield-chasing investors are snapping up single-family houses to rent out or flip. They are competing for houses with ordinary people, who are armed with the cheapest mortgage financing ever, and driving up home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You now have permanent capital competing with a young couple trying to buy a house," said John Burns, whose eponymous real estate consulting firm estimated that in many of the nation's top markets, about one in every five houses sold is bought by someone who never moves in. "That's going to make U.S. housing permanently more expensive," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consulting firm found Houston to be a favorite haunt of investors, who have lately accounted for 24% of home purchases there. Investors' slice of the housing market grows -- as it does in other boomtowns, such as Miami, Phoenix and Las Vegas -- among properties priced below $300,000 and in decent school districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Limited housing supply, low rates, a global reach for yield, and what we're calling the institutionalization of real-estate investors has set the stage for another speculative investor-driven home price bubble," the firm concluded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bubble has room to grow before it bursts, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting. But it is inflating fast. The firm expects home prices to climb 12% this year -- on top of last year's 11% rise -- and increase at least 6% in 2022, a period of appreciation reminiscent of 2004 and 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That boom was different, fueled by loose lending that enabled individuals to speculate on home prices by racking up mortgages they could repay only if home prices kept climbing. The money party ended a few years later when home prices stopped rising. The ensuing crash wiped out $11 trillion in U.S. household wealth and brought the financial system to the brink of collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financiers stepped in starting in 2011 and gobbled up foreclosed homes at steep discounts. They dispatched buyers to courthouse auctions with duffel bags of cash, and managed tens of thousands of far-flung properties thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They dominated the market for a few years, accounting for about a third of sales in some markets and setting a floor for falling prices. There wasn't much competition. Stung by losses, banks made it harder for regular home buyers to get a mortgage. Millions of people were underwater, owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-rental firms, including <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>, thrived. Renting suburban homes proved so profitable that landlords hit the open market and added properties at full price once foreclosures dried up. Many now build houses explicitly to rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coronavirus pandemic sparked a race for home-office space and yards. Occupancy rates reached records, and rents are rising with home prices. The ecosystem of companies that service, finance and mimic the mega-landlords is booming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burns counted more than 200 companies and investment firms in the house hunt: computer-assisted flipper <span class="companylink">Opendoor Technologies Inc</span>., money managers including <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Asset Management</span> and <span class="companylink">BlackRock Inc</span>., platforms such as Fundrise and Roofstock that buy and arrange for the management of rentals on behalf of individuals and builder LGI Homes Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spring brought a fresh stampede of buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PCCP LLC, which typically invests in apartment buildings and office towers, said it bought rental-home communities in the Southeast, the start of a $1 billion pact with <span class="companylink">Calstrs</span>, California's $286.9 billion teachers' retirement system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madison Realty Capital moved into rentals with clients that used to focus on developing apartment buildings and owner-occupied subdivisions. On Thursday, it closed a $110 million loan on a project in Los Angeles, where 220 of the nearly 700 home sites are being sold to investors. The original plans, derailed by the housing crash, didn't envision any rentals. "A lot of things that would have been for-sale housing are going to be for-rent housing," said Josh Zegen, Madison's managing principal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce McNeilage began building houses to rent out around Nashville, Tenn., in 2005. After the housing crash, his Kinloch Partners expanded into other Southeastern markets, flipping occupied rentals to bigger investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kinloch was financed mostly by community banks in the cities where it rehabbed foreclosures and built rentals. These days Kinloch can borrow far more from <span class="companylink">Walker &amp; Dunlop Inc</span>., a commercial real estate lender forging into suburban rentals. Mr. McNeilage's problem is that others are bidding up houses and lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am boxed out," he said. "There's too many people chasing things and they're willing to overpay. It's silly money right now."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you've been thinking about buying a house, you're not alone. After the pandemic and a record drop in interest rates sparked a frenzied search for new space, this spring's selling season is poised to be a doozy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in a red-hot housing market with low inventory and high competition, the usual buying questions still apply. But there are some extra considerations to mull.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What will your long-term needs be once the pandemic is over?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key here is "long-term." That might not mean more space for your Peloton bike or an office with good lighting for your many Zoom calls. You may prioritize access to good schools for your growing family or proximity to parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House hunters need to consider how long they plan to stay in this house, said Samuel Rad, certified financial planner at Affluencer Financial and instructor at the <span class="companylink">University of California, Los Angeles</span>. Instead some are operating on overconfidence about personal savings accumulated during the pandemic and a concern they will miss out on any homes that are left to purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're in a space where they're running on FOMO," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That mind-set can end up hurting buyers, if they buy a house at the current elevated prices and need to trade up in a few years. Be mindful that the market could come down a bit, and the price of the home you're buying with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it smarter in such a hot market to buy a fixer-upper or a move-in ready home?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, fixer-uppers may end up costing more than you planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooke Baenen, a Realtor based in Green Bay, Wisc., reminds her clients that in this market the temptation to buy a cheaper house in need of repair should be tempered by higher expenses and wait times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renovation process for fixer-upper buyers could cost more and take longer to complete because home construction materials are now scarce due to the pandemic. Many contractors and tradespeople are turning down requests or giving longer timelines for jobs due to the housing boom and pent-up demand following shutdowns across the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Things you wouldn't even know about, like the tar they use for roofing shingles, have already changed price five times," she said. "So I tell people this won't be a quick process."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because it's already taking some buyers so long to find the right house and secure an offer, she said, many of her clients are already setting new expectations. "New paint, new flooring, fine," she said. "But nothing more intense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Has the pandemic changed how much house you can afford?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, look at what you have saved up for a down payment and what your monthly mortgage payments would be. For renters, what you're currently paying a month is a good barometer. Owning a property includes upfront expenses, like closing costs, and ongoing costs, like maintenance and homeowners association fees. Aim for a monthly mortgage payment that won't stretch your budget too far, along with some cushion to handle emergencies and other unexpected fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A house budget must consider the following:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- The mortgage rate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- How much you saved for a down payment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- How much you can afford in monthly mortgage payments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Other expenses such as taxes and closing costs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Local housing prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current housing boom is partly fueled by the drop in interest rates. As rates creep up, some house hunters may feel the urge to move more quickly. Mortgage lenders will look at your income, credit history and debt-to-income ratio before you lock in a low rate, so have those numbers at the ready. Consider getting preapproval so you can put in an offer quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Speed is the name of the game right now and when you know more, you move faster," said Andrew Ragusa, CEO and broker of REMI Realty in Plainview, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ragusa recommends downloading a mortgage calculator to your phone so you can do the math as you look at houses. And don't forget to calculate property taxes into the equation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average household spends close to $2,500 on property taxes on their homes each year, according to WalletHub data, and if you're moving to another city or state, you'll likely have to reconfigure your payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property tax number could also affect where you look to purchase a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the pandemic turned many Americans' focus to the details of their long-term financial security, states like Florida are seeing an influx of buyers from New York, California and other states with high property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can you afford to wait?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates are rising, but they aren't expected to skyrocket overnight. Housing prices are expected to stay high as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The issue happening now -- and it's going to be present for at least the next few months -- is that we're entering the spring selling season now but we're already at the lowest level of inventory in any spring buying season we've ever had, and it's not going to get better in the time ahead because we need new housing," said Ed Pinto, director of the AEI Housing Center at the <span class="companylink">American Enterprise Institute</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't an easy time for buyers. Without another house to sell, first-time buyers can be beat out by those with more money to offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In this current economy, I personally don't believe you have an advantage as a first-time home buyer," Mr. Rad said. "Experienced home buyers have confidence when they're buying a property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, Ms. Baenen said, first-time buyers have an advantage in that they don't have to sell their house or face the prospect of carrying two properties if they can't. Many of them can close quickly, which can be an edge in this hot market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you prepared for a bidding war?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're going into the hottest housing markets right now, expect competing buyers to up the ante.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Widening your budget to account for a possible bidding war is realistic, said Mike Fratatoni, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association. But jumping at the chance to "win" is only going to set you up for disappointment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Get into a situation that's sustainable for the long run," he said. "You don't want to get into a situation where you win the bidding war but have regrets of getting into a situation beyond your means."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than budget for a $300,000 house, for example, Ms. Baenen tells clients to look at $250,000 houses. Chances are, the bids will come in higher on the supposedly cheaper house anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are of course ways to have an edge, including offering attractive terms like a fast close, becoming an all-cash buyer (if that is an option for you) or even writing a compelling buyer-seller letter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Cash buyers are blowing people out of the water," Ms. Baenen said. "But some of these buyer-seller letters are so moving."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers: This is your time. If you're already a homeowner, your home is likely a lot more valuable now than it was a year ago. Median home prices increased 14% in the past 12 months, according to Redfin data, with high-end single-family homes in great demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before homeowners break out moving boxes and grab the "for sale" sign expecting a big payday, here are some things to keep in mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You just refinanced your mortgage. Should you sell?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may want to wait. Many people refinanced their mortgages in the last 12 months to capitalize on superlow rates. Just know that it often takes a year or more to recover the costs associated with refinancing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When someone is refinancing, they should go through the thought experiment of: 'Can I stay in this house long enough to make it worth it?'" said Mike Fratatoni, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider how the potential profit on your current home could offset the refinancing costs and the savings you stand to get from the new loan terms. Follow up with your mortgage lender to talk over the terms you agreed upon when refinancing. They may be able to help you talk through potential pitfalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which sellers hold an edge now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downsizers and retirees. Those who have built up a significant amount of equity in their homes are in the best position, said Brooke Baenen, a Realtor in Green Bay, Wisc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is also a great time for those entering retirement, said Samuel Rad, certified financial planner at Affluencer Financial and instructor at the <span class="companylink">University of California, Los Angeles</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Retiree sellers are winning in this market," he said. "You've owned your home for a while so you have a ton of equity, and you have the availability and the affordability to move somewhere more cost-effective. They can buy better homes and have a better retirement." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A for sale sign is up on a street in Sacramento, Calif. PHOTO: Salgu Wissmath for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which sellers don't?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ones about to be buyers. "I tell people, 'I could sell your house tomorrow, but where are you going to live?" Ms. Baenen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers are the big winners of the moment, with the supply of available homes so scarce. The problem is that they'll be on the other side of the equation when they buy, facing the same low inventory and cutthroat bidding that boosted their profits on the selling side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We want to hear from you</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you thinking of selling your house? Describe why. Use the form at the end of the article to tell us about your experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unless you're moving into an apartment or a cottage or you already have a second home, you're going to end up in the same situation as everybody else," said Ms. Baenen. "So I have definitely had sellers say, 'Maybe we'll wait a little while. Maybe I could get that extra 20k, but am I going to spend that all in trying to rent a place?'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you'll be spending on a rental, consider whether it is really worth it to sell your current home. And if you're happy with where you live, ignore the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can you avoid extra costs if you sell now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone researching how to sell their home is bound to encounter different advice on how to save as much money as possible. Online sellers. Dual agents representing both buyers and sellers. Even selling your home yourself. But financial planner Mike Metzger says he advises his clients to be extra-cautious right now, especially with so many people looking to alleviate the pressure of low inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I know folks don't like to pay commission fees, but there's so many caveats in a hot housing market like this," Mr. Metzger said. "Work with a knowledgeable Realtor. That's the traditional path for a reason."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should you try to take any last-minute steps to increase the value of your home before you sell?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Probably not. In years past, Ms. Baenen's clients would consider sprucing up their houses or buying new appliances before putting them on the market. Now, she sees buyers snatch up whatever is available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It used to be that a seller had to serve that house up on a platter with everything clean and all the clutter put away," she said. "Now, it could be dirty, the paint could be chipping, there could be junk all over the place. People don't care. I'm telling my sellers, 'Just leave it. Why bother? The house is going to sell in two days.'"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you've been thinking about buying a house, you're not alone. After the pandemic and a record drop in interest rates[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/30-year-mortgage-rate-tops-3-for-first-time-since-july-11614870208]sparked a frenzied search for new space, this spring's selling season is poised to be a doozy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in a red-hot housing market with low inventory and high competition, the usual buying questions still apply. But there are some extra considerations to mull.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Has the pandemic changed how much house you can afford?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, look at what you have saved up for a down payment and what your monthly mortgage payments would be. For renters, what you're currently paying a month is a good barometer. Owning a property includes upfront expenses, like closing costs, and ongoing costs, like maintenance and homeowner's association fees. Aim for a monthly mortgage payment that won't stretch your budget too far, along with some cushion to handle emergencies and other unexpected fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A house budget must consider the following: the mortgage rate, how much you saved for a down payment, how much you can afford in monthly mortgage payments, local housing prices and other expenses such as taxes and closing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current housing boom is partly fueled by the drop in interest rates. As rates creep up, some house hunters may feel the urge to move more quickly. Mortgage lenders will look at your income, credit history and debt-to-income ratio before you lock in a low rate, so have those numbers at the ready.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Speed is the name of the game right now and when you know more, you move faster," said Andrew Ragusa, CEO and broker of REMI Realty in Plainview, N.Y.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A view inside a house that will soon be on the market in Sacramento, Calif. PHOTO: Salgu Wissmath for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What will your long-term needs be once the pandemic is over?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key here is "long-term." That might not mean more space for your Peloton bike or an office with good lighting for your many Zoom calls. You may prioritize access to good schools for your growing family or proximity to parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House hunters need to consider how long they plan to stay in this house, said Samuel Rad, certified financial planner at Affluencer Financial and instructor at the <span class="companylink">University of California, Los Angeles</span>. Instead some are operating on overconfidence about personal savings accumulated during the pandemic and a concern they will miss out on any homes that are left to purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're in a space where they're running on FOMO," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That mind-set can end up hurting buyers, if they buy a house at the current elevated prices and need to trade up in a few years. Be mindful that the market could come down a bit, and the price of the home you're buying with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it smarter in such a hot market to buy a fixer upper or a move-in ready home?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, fixer-uppers may end up costing more than you planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooke Baenen, a Wisconsin-based Realtor, reminds her clients that in this market, the temptation to buy a cheaper house in need of repair should be tempered by higher expenses and wait times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We want to hear from you</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you hoping to buy a house this spring, or have you bought a house recently? Use the form at the end of the article to tell us about your experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renovation process for fixer-upper buyers could cost more and take longer to complete because home construction materials are now scarce due to the pandemic. Many contractors and tradespeople are turning down requests or giving longer timelines for jobs due to the housing boom and pent-up demand following shutdowns across the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Things you wouldn't even know about, like the tar they use for roofing shingles, have already changed price five times," she said. "So I tell people this won't be a quick process."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because it is already taking some buyers so long to find the right house and secure an offer, she said, many of her clients are already setting new expectations. "New paint, new flooring, fine," she said. "But nothing more intense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can you afford to wait?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Interest rates are rising[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/30-year-mortgage-rate-tops-3-for-first-time-since-july-11614870208], but they aren't expected to skyrocket overnight. Housing prices are expected to stay high as well.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than a day after real-estate agent Andrea White listed a three-bedroom home for sale in Sacramento, Calif., in March, she received an all-cash offer. The buyer—who had not even seen the home in person—was ready to pay $520,000, Ms. White said. That was $21,000 above the asking price and 37% more than the seller had paid for the ranch-style home only two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accepting the offer was the easy part. Ms. White then had to call 17 other agents who had scheduled tours of the house to let them know it was off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. White, who works for brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>. and has been an agent since 2014, has never seen anything like the sales mania gripping her Northern California city. "It's exhausting," she said. "I'm speechless. It's heartbreaking for buyers; it's celebration for sellers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past year has been the hottest for sales activity[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-pandemic-ignited-a-housing-boombut-its-different-from-the-last-one-11615824558] in 14 years. Home values are rising in practically every corner of the U.S., and median sale prices in dozens of metro areas have posted double-digit percentage increases from a year ago, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow Group Inc</span>. In Boise, Idaho, the median sale price rose almost 25% in January from a year earlier, while in Stamford, Conn., it rose 19%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices are up virtually everywhere," said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co. "It is surprising to see home prices rebound this quickly, by this magnitude, this early into an economic recovery." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the pace of home price gains has been dizzying, it's not hard to understand what is driving the frenzy. Mortgage rates sit near historic lows. Millions of millennials are entering their early 30s[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/millennials-help-power-this-years-housing-market-rebound-11598520601], the typical age of first-time home buyers. And the pandemic has spurred new demand: Some buyers want more space to work from home while others are willing to move farther from their offices. Many workers who kept their jobs in 2020 were able to save up for down payments due to stimulus checks, forbearance on student loan payments[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/a-year-without-student-loan-payments-11616252402] and less spending on travel and entertainment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supply, meanwhile, has never been tighter. New-home construction plummeted during the 2007-09 recession and remained low in the following years[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/american-housing-shortage-slams-the-door-on-buyers-1521395460]. Homeowners are also staying in their houses longer[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-market-stays-tight-as-homeowners-stay-put-11611226802], in part because aging baby boomers are staying healthier later in life and choosing not to downsize. The number of homes for sale in March was roughly half of what it was a year ago, according to Realtor.com. In Austin, Texas, Jacksonville, Fla., and Raleigh, N.C., the year-over-year inventory decline topped 70%. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, parent of The Wall Street Journal, operates Realtor.com.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has rarely been this competitive, especially for first-time home buyers or those with limited budgets. Bidding wars are common, and new listings don't last for long. Nearly three in every four homes sold in February sat on the market for less than a month, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family house prices across the nation rose 12% in January from a year earlier—marking the biggest annual increase in data going back to 1991, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> said this week. All nine regions of the country tracked by FHFA posted year-over-year price gains of more than 10%. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even with house prices rising quickly[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-equity-loans-and-home-equity-lines-of-credit-how-they-work-and-when-to-use-them-11607724786], many homeowners are reluctant to sell because they worry about competing for another home in the same market, said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. With mortgage rates so low, many households decided to refinance[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/mortgage-rates-are-rising-read-this-before-you-refinance-11615557620] last year instead of moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More inventory could come on the market this spring, which is typically the busiest season for home sales, real-estate agents say. But there are unlikely to be enough new listings to cool the market. Nationally, there was a two-month supply of homes on the market at the end of February, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>, near an all-time low.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How have the pandemic and work-from-home arrangements affected your real-estate decisions? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even high-priced cities where sales plunged last spring are showing signs of growth. Manhattan co-op and condo sales in the first quarter of 2021 exceeded year-earlier levels for the first time in four quarters, according to brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. In San Francisco, home sales in February rose 19% from a year earlier, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are trying to increase construction to meet the booming demand. New construction has rebounded from its recession-era lows in recent years, but the nation still has a shortage of millions of units. Home-building activity slowed last spring and ramped up over the summer. But the construction pace is limited by high lumber costs, material bottlenecks and a shortage of land and labor[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-boom-brings-a-shortage-of-land-to-build-new-homes-11608904980], according to builders and economists. Buying interest is so strong that many builders are restricting how many homes they sell at a time. They want to make sure they don't sell more than they can build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and executives expect demand to remain robust this year, and they anticipate the demographic-driven strength to continue for years as the large millennial and Gen Z generations get older. Still, there have been some recent indications that price growth could slow as more homes come on the market. Rising mortgage rates—which sit at the highest level since June and have been climbing steadily in recent weeks—could price some buyers out of the market later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even buyers exhilarated by the prospect of owning their first home have been wiped out by the undertaking. Samantha and Doug Hawkins, both 32 years old, moved out of their one-bedroom apartment in Boston when the pandemic struck and into Ms. Hawkins's parents' house. They built up their savings by not paying rent, and Ms. Hawkins paid off her student loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when they started house hunting late last year, they found it tough to compete against other bidders. They were told that sellers wouldn't consider offers with down payments of less than 20%, said Ms. Hawkins, who works in human resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After increasing their budget and expanding their search area, the Hawkinses had their sixth offer accepted in March, for a four-bedroom house in Westford, Mass., farther from Boston than they had originally looked. They're under contract and expect the deal to close in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're really proud that we're able to do this, and excited to take the next step in our lives," Ms. Hawkins said. "But to have it be such a competitive market…. It's just taken a little bit of the joy out of the process."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan's residential real-estate market, dormant for months after many New Yorkers fled near the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, closed the first quarter by posting its strongest sales in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, around 1,500 Manhattan residences were in contract for sale. That marked the highest number of deals for any one month in 14 years, according to real-estate analytics firm UrbanDigs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in sales reflects pent-up demand following a severe slowdown during the early months of the pandemic, when New York City was at a standstill as the virus surged, said Noah Rosenblatt, co-founder of UrbanDigs. Buyers are now jumping back into the market as the vaccine rollout accelerates and confidence grows that New York City is safe following a pandemic that has killed more than 31,000 residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have a rubber-band effect going on in Manhattan," Mr. Rosenblatt said. "We pulled the rubber band one way, in a bad direction, during 2020, and now it's kind of shooting back the other way."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have been taking advantage of low mortgage rates and seized on the chance to pick up prime Manhattan real estate at lower prices. The median sales price for Manhattan co-ops was $780,000 in the first quarter, down 3.8% year-over-year, according to brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. Condos, meanwhile, sold for a median price of $1.55 million, down 4.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosenblatt said the "fear discount" that some buyers received last spring is no longer in play, and he expects increasing prices to start being reflected by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan residential prices started to tumble in March 2020 as fear of Covid-19 intensified. By May, values were down nearly 11% from the start of the year, according to UrbanDigs. But they started to recover not long after, and in some cases sale prices now appear to be well ahead of January 2020 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason any price gains have been modest, compared with much of the rest of the country, is the excess amount of supply in Manhattan. But inventory has fallen 22.5% since the third quarter and is now only about 6.9% above the 20-year quarterly average, said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Miller said that while Manhattan's housing market is recovering, he wouldn't describe it as booming just yet. He believes the next big step will be when companies start calling workers back into the office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey of major employers by the business group Partnership for New York City found that 10% of Manhattan office employees had returned to their desks by early March. Survey respondents said they expected 45% of workers to be back in the office by September, but Mr. Miller said he believes many will accelerate that timeline given the quickening pace of the vaccine rollout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When corporate America comes back, and those buildings, instead of being 80-90% empty, are 15-20% empty, that will go a long way in the housing market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signed contracts in Manhattan in the first quarter surged to 3,700, up 58% from the same quarter in 2020. It was the highest total for the first quarter since 2007, according to real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>. Sales were strongest on the borough's west and east sides and downtown, while upper Manhattan and Midtown saw lower sales, compared with last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers included renters taking advantage of lower prices and low mortgage rates, as well as people trading up for bigger spaces with more room for home offices and outdoor amenities like terraces and courtyards, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate market's recovery is key to New York City's overall economy, with declining housing values already expected to lower property-tax revenue by about $1 billion next year, according to estimates by the New York City Independent Budget Office. Mr. Rosenblatt of UrbanDigs said he expects the market's recovery to steadily ramp up in the next one to three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're going to have the ground-floor retail come back, you're going to have the office workers come back, you're going to have the students come back," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some worried that the pandemic would permanently drive people out of the city, the rising home sales show that families are returning as schools and some office buildings reopen.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG) operates Broadway's Lyric Theatre and Brooklyn's Kings Theatre. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that it owns the two venues. In addition, the earlier version misspelled Kings Theatre as Kings Theater. (Corrected on April 1)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Ambassador Theatre Group</span>, a British-based company that owns or operates venues in New York and elsewhere, is looking to strengthen its position on the Broadway scene, even as the industry remains shut down by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, ATG's parent company, International Entertainment Holdings Ltd., announced that it had acquired three U.S. theaters—the Golden Gate and Orpheum in San Francisco, and the Fisher in Detroit—for an undisclosed price from the Nederlander Company. All three venues have been home for many years to touring Broadway shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the theaters would retain their role as touring houses, ATG Chief Executive Officer Mark Cornell said the company is also considering using them as a stage for shows in development, including ones it may produce itself, before bringing them to Broadway, potentially at its own venues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When do you expect to return to a live theater event? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Broadway, the company took over operations of the venue now called the Lyric Theatre in 2013 and established the Hudson Theatre as Broadway's newest space in 2017[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/on-with-the-shows-broadway-adds-another-theater-1486068526]. An ATG spokesman said the company's investment in developing and renovating Broadway theaters totals more than $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATG has a global portfolio, with theaters from Boston to Berlin, plus 10 venues in London's West End. It also operates Brooklyn's Kings Theatre[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-k-s-ambassador-theatre-group-acquires-five-u-s-venues-1441080006], a 3,000-seat venue that has been used primarily for concerts in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lyric has been home in recent years to "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child," the two-part drama tied to J.K. Rowling's literary franchise. The Hudson has featured a variety of shows, including rock star David Byrne's acclaimed "American Utopia," a theatrically conceived concert presentation. Both venues have been closed since the pandemic-related shutdown of Broadway theaters in March 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATG has already put its pipeline-to-New York approach into practice with its Boston venue, the Emerson Colonial Theatre, where such shows as "American Utopia" and "Moulin Rouge! The Musical" have played before opening on Broadway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A revival of the Neil Simon comedy "Plaza Suite," starring Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick, also ran at the Colonial in early 2020 and is set to come to the Hudson when Broadway reopens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATG's aspirations could extend to adding more Broadway venues, Mr. Cornell said. But at issue is the fact that none are currently for sale, he noted. "If something did come on the market, we'd be extremely interested," Mr. Cornell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry professionals said it is unlikely that any Broadway theaters will change hands, at least in the short term. Still, veteran Broadway producer Ken Davenport said there might be other options, noting that a company with ATG's growth ambitions could purchase property in New York's theater district and build a new venue altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Davenport added that the city's pandemic-depressed real-estate market "creates opportunities" for ATG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond Broadway, ATG could also look at Kings Theatre in Brooklyn as a place to bring shows. Mr. Cornell said the venue is currently geared for concerts and would require work to be converted into a genuine Broadway-style theater, but he didn't rule out the possibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given Brooklyn's size and population of more than two million, "there's no reason they shouldn't have a glorious theater of their own," Mr. Cornell said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>835 words</div><div>31 March 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices are rising at the fastest pace in 15 years, reflecting how fiercely buyers are competing for a limited supply of homes in nearly every corner of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From small cities like Bridgeport, Conn., to large ones like Seattle, prices have been steadily moving higher. Two closely watched house-price indicators released Tuesday posted double-digit national price growth, demonstrating the widespread strength of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of forces have merged to fuel the red-hot housing market, including mortgage rates dropping below 3% in July for the first time ever. Millions of millennials are aging into their prime home-buying years in their 30s. New-home construction has lagged behind demand and homeowners are holding on to their houses longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coronavirus pandemic has turbocharged this demand. Many Americans sought homes with more space to work remotely during Covid-19, or felt freed to move farther from their offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the pandemic worsened the already severe shortage of homes for sale. Low interest rates prompted more homeowners to refinance and stay put instead of moving. Others delayed their moves due to concern about virus exposure, according to real-estate agents. Even as home builders have ramped up the pace of new construction in an effort to keep up with demand, they are limited by rising material costs and shortages of land and labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It really can only be characterized as a super sellers' market, not even just a sellers' market," said Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at First American Financial Corp. "The supply-demand imbalance isn't going away anytime soon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing boom has been a big benefit to these sellers and current homeowners across the U.S., while making it more difficult for first-time buyers and others with less income to enter the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 1.03 million homes for sale at the end of February, unchanged from the January level, which was the lowest in data going back to 1982, the National Association of Realtors said this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 11.2% in the year that ended in January, the highest annual rate of price growth since February 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 20-city index rose 11.1% from a year earlier, and price growth accelerated in all 20 cities. Phoenix had the fastest home-price growth in the country for the 20th straight month, at 15.8%, followed by Seattle at 14.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately on Tuesday, a house-price index compiled by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> found a 12% increase in home prices in January from a year earlier, a record annual gain in data going back to 1991, the agency said. The Mountain region, which includes states like Idaho and Arizona, posted the strongest annual gain, at 14.8%, while the West South Central division, which includes Texas and Louisiana, was the slowest, at 10.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The houses are flying off the shelves," said Monika Prasai, a real-estate agent in San Diego. "You have buyers who are ready and willing to move, but it's difficult to find them something because there is no inventory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some housing markets hard hit by the pandemic are showing renewed signs of strength. In Manhattan, contract signings in March have been the highest for that month since 2007, according to data tracker UrbanDigs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small cities like Pittsfield, Mass., also posted median-price increases of more than 30% in the fourth quarter, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>. The median sales price for existing homes in each of the more than 180 metro areas tracked by the group rose in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, signaling the widest breadth of home price gains in recent memory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chelsea and Joe Carboni had offers rejected on three homes before getting one accepted for a four-bedroom house in Mableton, Ga. They have been living in a townhouse in the same area with their 2-year-old daughter and wanted more space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses routinely went under contract within days of going on the market, Ms. Carboni said. "It was really slim pickings," she said. "I feel a sigh of relief for sure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability is a growing concern, especially for first-time buyers. In the four weeks ended March 21, 39% of homes that went under contract sold for more than their list price, up from 23.9% a year earlier, according to real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the shortage of homes for sale is likely to continue to buoy house prices. But mortgage rates are also ticking higher, which could slow some of the buying demand. For the week ended Thursday, the average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 3.17%, the highest level since June, said <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professionals with young children are fueling a jump in Manhattan home sales, with widely available vaccines and a city turning toward a reopening enticing more New Yorkers to buy. These buyers are taking advantage of price discounts and low interest rates, renewing a commitment to New York life with the worst of the pandemic now likely in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these families spent part of the past year away from New York, where they sought roomier accommodations to work from home and where their children had their own spaces to study and play. A net of 70,000 residents left the New York metropolitan region over the course of 2020, according to estimates by location-analytics company Unacast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales figures suggest that with most schools allowing in-person instruction and more workers trickling back into Midtown office buildings, families are coming back to the city with plans to stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan home-sales contracts for three- and four-bedroom homes increased 80% on an annual basis this February, according to a report from real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>. Neighborhoods where sales increased most include the Upper West Side and Midtown. The 1,164 new sales contracts were the most recorded by Corcoran during the month of February since at least 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a dramatic turnaround after Manhattan co-op and condo sales fell more than 54% in the second quarter of 2020, right when home sales were beginning to explode in much of the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's been a shift in the outlook," said Sarah Saltzberg, founder of uptown Manhattan real-estate brokerage Bohemia Realty Group. "And people are like, 'Oh, yeah, I guess New York really is going to come back.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space is still top of mind for Manhattan buyers with children, both inside the home and out, according to several brokers. Many are looking for at least one more bedroom over what they currently have. And proximity to the park now beats out distance from the subway, said Laura Cook, a broker at Keller Williams NYC. "Once you've been cooped up for a year, you really realize how much [space] matters," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, Craig Ellis, a former consultant who now works for a religious nonprofit, shared a one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side with his wife, Lisa, and three small children. They had lofts built into the 12-by-8-foot bedroom to accommodate all five of them in a single, shared sleeping space. When the pandemic hit, what was already an unconventional arrangement became unworkable. So the family headed to stay with Mr. Ellis's parents in Kansas, where they have lived, worked and studied remotely for the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift to Kansas, where Mr. Ellis grew up with 13 acres and a horse, was a welcome respite for the family and new adventure for his children, ages 6 to 10. "Their upbringing is radically different than mine. They're, like, scared of the grass," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But New York City is the only home Mr. Ellis's three children have ever known. They are now shopping for a two- or three-bedroom apartment, working with a budget of about $1.2 million. "We feel like New York is where we're supposed to be," Mr. Ellis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marci Czel and her wife, parents to 3- and 5-year-old children, decamped for a family home in Vermont last March, returning to Harlem for good in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They then began the search for their dream brownstone in the neighborhood where they have lived for six years and where their children attend school. They found a 3,300-square-foot townhouse with a garden apartment the couple plans to rent out. They are now in contract to buy the home, which was last listed for $3.3 million. They said the seller has accepted their offer at a significant discount on the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate brokers said that the price discounts many buyers enjoyed in the fall and winter are getting harder to come by. A report from brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> showed that by the end of 2020, average sales price per square foot in Manhattan was down only 3% compared with one year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Saltzberg said many of the apartments her company is selling have become subject to bidding wars again. "There's so little inventory," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the U.S. housing market booms[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-reach-highest-level-in-14-years-11611327933], a parallel rise in residential real-estate prices across the world from Amsterdam to Auckland is raising fears of possible bubbles and prompting some governments to intervene to prevent their markets from overheating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers were already worried about high property prices in parts of Europe, Asia and Canada before the pandemic, especially as years of low interest rates kept demand strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now the trillions of dollars of stimulus deployed world-wide to fight the effects of Covid-19, along with changes in buying patterns as more people work from home, are turbocharging markets further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is putting policy makers in a bind. Many want to keep interest rates low to sustain the post-pandemic recovery, but they worry about people taking on too much debt to buy houses whose prices could stagnate or fall later. Other tools they have to cool demand, like tighter mortgage restrictions, aren't always working, or are being postponed as authorities try to ensure broader economic growth stays on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Danish central bank</span> recently warned that cheap financing and savings that expanded during the pandemic could lead to people taking on more debt to purchase houses and property prices spiraling upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is clear that rising [house] prices of between 5% and 10% annually, depending on the market we are talking about, are not sustainable in the long run," said Karsten Biltoft, assistant governor at the central bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China, regulators have tried tamping down property markets to cool what one senior banking official referred to as a "bubble,"[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-zealands-new-leader-wants-to-go-further-than-most-to-curb-housing-prices-1509533271] to little avail. Property prices are up 16% over the past year in the city of Shenzhen, for example. In New Zealand, authorities recently tightened mortgage lending standards[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-zealands-new-leader-wants-to-go-further-than-most-to-curb-housing-prices-1509533271], with median home prices climbing 23% in February from a year earlier to a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sydney, where property prices also recently hit records, new mortgage demand is so high that some banks are struggling to keep up, said Christian Stevens, senior credit adviser at mortgage brokerage Shore Financial. Turnaround times for processing mortgage applications have increased from a few days to more than a month in some cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's crazy," he said. "We've never been this busy or seen this much inquiry. And it doesn't look like it's slowing down anytime soon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 37 wealthy countries that make up the <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span>, home prices hit a record in the third quarter of 2020, according to <span class="companylink">OECD</span> data. Prices rose almost 5% on the year, the fastest in nearly 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. has also seen strong house price appreciation[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-realtors-pile-into-hot-housing-market-most-find-it-tough-going-11616328002], though economists generally aren't too worried. Compared with previous periods of housing-market exuberance, buyers have higher credit ratings and are putting down more cash upfront on purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists see similar silver linings elsewhere, making a replay of the global 2008 housing crash, which sent the world into recession, unlikely. Hot markets could cool naturally without wider damage as interest rates rise and pent-up demand is met. As in the U.S., much of the buying globally is being driven by real demand rather than speculation, with families looking to upgrade to larger properties in suburban areas[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/connecticuts-housing-market-hit-new-high-in-2020-report-says-11612298605] as they work more from home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's been this almost global reset as people have taken a step back during lockdown periods and reassessed their lifestyle," said Kate Everett-Allen, head of international residential research at Knight Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong home-price appreciation also makes homeowners feel wealthier and encourages more spending and construction, as developers build more supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, with equities prices also at or near record highs, some officials are worried that vast amounts of stimulus are pushing asset prices to unsustainable levels in some global cities, which could lead to local market corrections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dutch central bank</span> told The Wall Street Journal that one concern is that sharp property price increases could be forcing households to take on excessive risk to finance home purchases. Prices in the Netherlands, where there is also a housing supply crunch, rose 7.8% last year, after a 6.9% rise in 2019, according to analysts at <span class="companylink">ING Groep</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's central bank governor, Tiff Macklem, said in February there were early signs of "excess exuberance" in the Canadian housing market[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canadian-housing-boom-raises-concern-with-homes-selling-far-above-ask-prices-11616590877], with prices up 17% on an adjusted basis over a one-year period, according to the <span class="companylink">Canadian Real Estate Association</span>. Mr. Macklem said officials would be monitoring the situation closely, but dismissed taking measures to rein in sales, saying the economy needed all the support it could get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments say they are also worried about pricing more families out of the market, which could exacerbate economic imbalances that have worsened during the pandemic and potentially drive younger people to put off having children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Seoul, where house prices at one point last year were up nearly 15% on an annualized basis, some couples are postponing registering marriages in the hope of making it easier to buy homes. Income thresholds for low-interest mortgages in South Korea are more generous for individuals than couples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Zealand, Sam Hindle, 29, says he and his wife bid on six houses and were rejected for all of them because of competition from other buyers, and eventually agreed to buy a house off-market from a friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just been a nightmare," said Mr. Hindle, who works in a bank call center and lives about a four-hour drive from Auckland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government officials recently told <span class="companylink">New Zealand's central bank</span> that it must consider the impact its policy decisions have on housing, though doing so could complicate rate-setting. The central bank also restricted the volume of high-risk mortgages banks can offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, China put new limits on developer financing in the hope of cooling housing prices, but the market has remained frothy. In early March, the chairman of China's main banking regulator said he was worried about a possible correction in home prices, which could threaten banks' stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's housing prices have kept climbing despite a much bleaker economic outlook than in the U.S. or China. In part that is because governments have kept supporting families with salary subsidies and moratoriums on loan repayments. It is also because interest rates remain extraordinarily low, with mortgage rates averaging 1.35% across the eurozone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denmark, mortgage holders have been able to borrow money at negative interest[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/with-negative-rates-homeowners-in-europe-are-paid-to-borrow-11616664600], meaning borrowers only pay the bank an administration fee. Negative interest in their favor either gets discounted from the fee or deducted from their mortgage principal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Stausholm, a Copenhagen real-estate agent, said he has sold 45 homes in less than three months this year, putting him on track to beat last year's record of 161 sales, despite Covid-19 restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of people want to put their money in brick," Mr. Stausholm said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pre-pandemic, the <span class="companylink">Dutch central bank</span> ruled that banks would need to hold more capital to cover potential losses in mortgage-loan portfolios, but implementation was postponed because of Covid-19. The central bank has also called for the government to gradually phase out tax incentives for homeowners, including mortgage-interest deductions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mick ten Bosch, a real-estate agency owner in Amsterdam, said he had 450 people trying to view one house last year, compared with an average of 20 pre-pandemic. This year is even busier, with houses selling for 15% to 20% above asking price, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teun Kraaij, a 34-year-old entrepreneur, bought a house in an area by the beach near Amsterdam with more space for his two children. While he had enough money to pay the full purchase price outright, his banker advised him to take a mortgage with a 1.2% interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's so cheap to borrow money nowadays, it doesn't make sense not to do it," Mr. Kraaij said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Suzanne Kapner and Esther Fung </div><div>1115 words</div><div>24 March 2021</div><div>08:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stores are reopening and customers are streaming back in, which means retailers that withheld rent during Covid-19 shutdowns are now able to pay. But first they have to agree with their landlords on how to define a sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords are increasingly offering deals in which retailers pay a percentage of their monthly sales in rent, rather than a fixed amount. Percentage-rent leases give retailers breathing room when sales decline and allow landlords to reap the upside when sales recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a sticking point. With e-commerce soaring, some landlords want to include a portion of online sales in the new leases, arguing that physical stores play an important role in many of these transactions. Retailers are pushing back, according to landlords, real-estate brokers and retail executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're just looking not to get hurt when they do sales" if the store is involved in that sale, David Simon, chief executive of Simon Property Group Inc., the country's largest mall owner, told analysts in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the store interaction is important to [retailers], we don't want our sales to be reduced because the store is providing a service," Mr. Simon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It used to be that simple math determined the sales generated by a store. But as e-commerce has become a bigger piece of the pie, and some stores use their retail locations for online fulfillment, the distinction between online and in-store sales has blurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If an order is placed online, but picked up at a store, should that count as an e-commerce sale or a store sale? Or if an item bought online is returned to a store? If online sales increase after a store opens, are landlords entitled to a portion of e-commerce sales within that store's ZIP Code?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no commonly accepted formulas, making these types of leases tricky to negotiate, according to the industry executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's become a very gray area," said Alyssa Gates, director of North American property for cosmetics retailer Lush, which has 214 U.S. stores. "Especially this past year, when there was so little in-store shopping."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retailers, including Sephora, which is owned by <span class="companylink">LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE</span>, and Everlane Inc., tend not to include online sales in rent calculations, even when those orders are fulfilled at stores, according to one of the industry executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Sephora spokeswoman declined to comment. A person close to Everlane confirmed that e-commerce sales aren't part of percentage rent calculations for New York City stores, but declined to discuss other locations. It has seven stores throughout the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Landlords don't want stores used as warehouses," said Annette Healey, executive vice president of CBRE Group Inc., a commercial real-estate services and investment company. "They want all of the space in the store to be dedicated to sales for that store. But most retailers feel that if the transaction originated online, it's not a store sale."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retailers typically paid a fixed monthly rent that landlords calculated based on prior leases and rents in nearby locations. Cities with higher household incomes and population densities often command higher rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As more shopping shifted online in recent years, eroding store sales, retailers wound up stuck in long-term leases they could no longer afford. That trend got supercharged during the pandemic[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/livecoverage/latest-updates/covid], when foot traffic to stores declined by 30% or more, according to <span class="companylink">ShopperTrak</span>, which uses cameras to count visitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retailers including <span class="companylink">Gap Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Dick's Sporting Goods Inc</span>. stopped paying a portion of their rent during the pandemic. Some of the disputes ended up in court[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/mall-landlord-simon-property-suing-retailer-gap-over-missed-rent-11591295748], while others were settled more amicably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One solution was to make rents variable to better align with fluctuating sales, the industry executives said. In these leases, retailers typically pay 5% to 15% of their monthly sales in rent, in addition to a fixed amount to cover property taxes, common-area charges and maintenance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords have been offering percentage rents at varying levels for decades. But in the past year, these types of leases have become increasingly common, particularly for mall and street locations that are seeing higher vacancy rates, the executives said. Some rents are structured as a hybrid, with retailers paying a fixed amount up to a certain level of sales and then a percent of sales beyond that threshold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, the agreements exclude that fixed amount. In Manhattan's SoHo district, Italian fashion retailer Pinko this month signed a yearlong sublease[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/manhattans-blighted-soho-district-showing-new-signs-of-life-11615482938] amounting to $30,000 a month or 15% of sales, whichever is greater. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downside for landlords is that percentage rent is unpalatable to their lenders, making their properties more difficult to finance. Investors want the guarantee of a steady income stream and covenants in their mortgages often require landlords to maintain rents above a certain level, the executives said</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The more percentage-rent deals that landlords do, the greater the push to include e-commerce sales in rent calculation," said Amish Tolia, the co-CEO of Leap Inc., which operates physical stores for online brands, including Faherty, Naadam and Goodlife Clothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tolia said all of his leases are based solely on sales generated by stores and don't include an e-commerce component, even when online orders are fulfilled at stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said conversations with landlords on the subject are becoming more frequent. For instance, he said, landlords want to know whether e-commerce sales increase within a specific radius after a store opens and what percentage of e-commerce shoppers visit that store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some landlords are launching their own online platforms for their tenants, in part to help them succeed but also to give them a clearer view of physical stores' influence on online sales. Bal Harbour Shops in Miami recently launched one such platform called Marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate brokers said the haggling has made lease negotiation far more complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ten years ago, you'd say this is the rent and hand over the keys," said David Abrams, chief executive of Masonre, a commercial real-estate brokerage and advisory firm. "Today, I have to be part psychologist and part accountant."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Paul Vieira </div><div>1108 words</div><div>24 March 2021</div><div>10:33</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA—The U.S. may be experiencing its biggest housing boom in decades, but one country has been outpacing its peers in home-price growth: Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just like in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and elsewhere, Canada is experiencing a housing craze fed by the Covid-19 pandemic and the demand for more space, rock-bottom interest rates, and demographics, with millennials moving into their prime-buying years. Yet Canada has seen a more dramatic price run-up than all <span class="companylink">Group of Seven</span> countries. According to housing data collected by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</span>, nominal house prices in Canada rose at an annual rate of about 16% in the fourth quarter from the previous three-month period, outpacing the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While in the U.S. there are few concerns about a bubble[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-pandemic-ignited-a-housing-boombut-its-different-from-the-last-one-11615824558] or a 2008-style crash, that's not the case in Canada, where some analysts and economists worry about real estate's outsize role in the country's economy that could be exposed in the next downturn. Canadian housing as a share of gross domestic product was 9.3% as of the fourth quarter of 2020, up from 7.5% a year earlier and from 6.6% a decade ago. In the U.S., housing is 4.6% of GDP, and the U.S. level at the height of its housing boom reached only 6.7%, according to data from <span class="companylink">BMO Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, starting in the third quarter of last year for the first time since data were collected in the 1960s, Canadian investment in real estate outstripped business investment in nonresidential structures, machinery and equipment as a share of GDP. While money is going into real estate, economists point out that houses don't produce the goods and services to meet domestic and foreign demand, and expand an economy's long-term potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate in Canada has become "just one giant consumer durable," akin to a car or a home appliance, said David Rosenberg, an economist and head of forecasting firm Rosenberg Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists add that overinvestment in housing is a drain on people's savings that might otherwise be directed into entrepreneurial activity. High home prices also reduce the share of income available for consumption, squeezing corporate margins further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a misallocation of capital—essentially money is going into the wrong things," said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments, which helps companies manage foreign-exchange holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment per worker in Canada badly lags behind the U.S. and other large economies that are members of the <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span>, according to research from the C.D. Howe Institute, a Toronto think tank. That's because investment tends to flock to where returns are plentiful and reliable, and right now in Canada, Mr. Schamotta said, that's real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Pasalis, president of Toronto real-estate brokerage Realosophy Realty, says he has been "sounding the alarm" on a housing bubble in the suburbs and exurbs surrounding Toronto, where prices have shot up over 30% in just eight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boom is now hitting farther afield[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/western-cities-want-to-slow-flood-of-chinese-home-buying-nothing-works-1528294587] than the run-up in 2016 and 2017. An area where it is boiling now is Ottawa, the capital. House prices have climbed by about 25% in a year, fueling bidding wars that were once unheard of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is the surge in Canadian real-estate prices getting too hot to handle? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The expectations for this market are just crazy right now," said David Gourlay, who sold a townhouse in November for nearly double the purchase price seven years ago and upgraded to a detached home in western Ottawa to accommodate his wife, daughter, newborn son and dog. He said for sellers in this market, "you have to decide: How much more do you want over your list price?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But buyer Emma Cormier was downbeat about her nearly yearlong home-buying quest. About two weeks ago, she and her partner offered 50,000 Canadian dollars, equivalent to about $40,000, more than the asking price of C$380,000 for a two-bedroom home in the Ottawa area. The house sold for C$601,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We absolutely had no chance," said Ms. Cormier, a 31-year-old project manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this past weekend, Ms. Cormier's luck turned. She and her partner bought a four-bedroom house about 37 miles southeast of the capital, with enough space for her two dogs to roam. "It's unheard of right now that we only had to offer C$40,000 above asking," she said of her purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pasalis said Canada's fiscal and monetary policies have encouraged the ramp-up in real-estate spending. While governments around the world last year doled out roughly $12 trillion to minimize the economic damage from restrictions in place amid the pandemic, Canada has been especially generous[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canadas-covid-19-response-is-to-spend-heavily-and-ignore-the-deficitfor-now-11606825162], with spending that accounted for roughly 19% of its total economic output. Government outlays during the pandemic helped lift after-tax household income last year by 10%, versus 2019, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's central bank has indicated it believes monetary stimulus will need to remain in place, and the federal Liberal government is also contemplating a fresh fiscal stimulus, of about 4% of GDP or C$100 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Asselin, senior vice-president of policy at the Business Council of Canada, a lobby group, said higher house prices have been one of the unintended consequences of the government's aggressive fiscal policy. He said he wants the government to pivot from stimulus to measures that attract business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economy needs productive investments," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of Canada Gov. Tiff Macklem said last month that there were early signs of "excess exuberance" in the country's housing market and that officials would be monitoring trends closely. A spokesman for <span class="companylink">Canada's finance department</span> said officials there were also keeping tabs on the "health and stability" of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Sal Guatieri, economist at BMO Capital Markets, said housing in Canada has been largely affordable outside some major cities. But that's changing now, he said, given the current price runup outside of urban centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is an imbalance in the economy," he said. "An unhealthy imbalance."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is facing rising interest rates, higher material costs and the simple fact that the flurry of pandemic buying probably pulled some demand forward. But rather than a perfect storm, those things may amount to no more than a passing rain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year since the Covid-19 crisis struck has been perversely good for the housing market. The combination of record-low mortgage rates and urbanites seeking more space in the suburbs helped fuel demand. And because job losses were less pronounced among the higher-income workers who make up the bulk of home buyers, the downturn didn't create the sort of stumbling block housing typically runs up against during a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors on Monday reported that seasonally adjusted sales of existing, or previously owned, homes took a step down in February from January, and Tuesday the Commerce Department reported the same of February new-home sales. Those drops were likely due more to bad weather, including the storm that left millions of people in Texas without power, than anything else. Even so, home sales were still substantially higher in February than they were a year earlier, before the pandemic struck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bigger concern is that with the spring selling season just starting, a confluence of factors could hurt demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowing costs have gone up, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rising to 3.09% from 2.65% earlier this year, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, and looking likely to head higher still. That brings back memories of 2018, when the 30-year rate climbed a full percentage point. Prices for lumber and other materials have shot up, prompting some home builders to raise prices. Finally, some home sales that typically come in the spring, such as by parents of young children seeking out space and schools in the suburbs, may have already happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, housing still has some important things going for it. First, even though mortgage rates have risen, outside of the past year, they are at their lowest levels in the history of <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> data. One result of this, points out Evercore ISI analyst Stephen Kim, is that compared with 2018 many fewer homeowners have a lower mortgage rate now than what is prevailing in the market, a disincentive to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the combination of reduced spending opportunities and government support led many Americans to save more during the pandemic while boosting their creditworthiness. As vaccinations continue and more segments of the economy reopen, the hesitancy some people probably felt about buying a home will likely fade. A strong economy itself is no bad thing for the housing market. Housing might not boom over the next year like it did in the past year, but it could still do just fine.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>960 words</div><div>22 March 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The red-hot housing market has achieved a number of milestones this past year. Perhaps the most telling is this: There are more real-estate agents than homes for sale in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This phenomenon reflects both the extremely tight supply of homes on the market and how surging prices are persuading tens of thousands more people to try their hands at selling real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Mitchell in Boston is one of them. He signed up for a real-estate course in June after being furloughed from a managerial position at a regional restaurant chain. He greeted the new profession enthusiastically, thinking his skills and focus on customer experience developed during 30 years in the restaurant business would be transferable to real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He got his license in October, but has yet to land any deals, as Covid-19-related restrictions are limiting in-person interactions with clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've learned some aspects of the business, but it's hard to connect with people. . .that you've never met," Mr. Mitchell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' membership count has exceeded the number of homes on the market only once before, in December 2019, when the number of agents dipped slightly but the inventory of homes for sale declined by more. It happened again last October and has held ever since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of January, there were 1.04 million homes for sale. That is down 26% from a year earlier and the lowest on record going back to 1982, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>. Also in January, the association had 1.45 million members, up 4.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is easy to understand why so many people would sign up for the real-estate profession: The pandemic eliminated millions of jobs, especially in service industries such as restaurants. The booming housing market suggests there is a lot of money to be made selling homes. And in most states, it doesn't take much more than taking a course and passing an exam to get a residential real-estate license.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State licensing exams can include questions on property laws and market analysis. Pass rates vary by state. In Texas, nearly two-thirds of test takers pass on the first try, according to the <span class="companylink">Texas Real Estate Commission</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are very low barriers to entry, in terms of the ease of getting a real-estate license," said Nick Bailey, chief customer officer at Re/Max Holdings Inc., a real-estate brokerage franchiser. "But the barriers to success are very high."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sellers generally favor agents with years of experience and proven sales records. That means newer agents tend to represent home buyers, many of whom are struggling to get an offer accepted with so few properties for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consequently, most agents make little or even no money in the beginning because they typically rely on commissions and don't get paid unless a sale is completed. Realtors with two years of experience or less earned a median gross income of $8,900 from their real-estate work in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that figure rises with more years on the job: The median gross income for all <span class="companylink">NAR</span> agents in 2019 was $49,700, up from $41,800 in 2018, the association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business is pretty fluid. <span class="companylink">NAR</span>, which represents the majority of active U.S. residential real-estate agents and brokers, said about 15% of its membership turns over every year. Agents usually work as independent contractors, and many work part-time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of agents also tends to roughly correlate with the performance of the housing market. The ranks of <span class="companylink">NAR</span> rose to 1.37 million in October 2006 -- shortly after the market's peak -- then bottomed out at around 960,000 in March 2012, following the housing crash. <span class="companylink">NAR</span> membership has risen every year since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>., which hires agents as employees, said it underestimated demand after the pandemic struck. Redfin furloughed 41% of its agents in April as sales slumped. The firm said it is now hiring 162 people a week in its brokerage business, up from 92 a week at the same time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is by far the most hiring we've ever done," Redfin Chief Executive Glenn Kelman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some new agents have enjoyed early success. Lauren Hurwitz of New Rochelle, N.Y., got her real-estate license in August after being laid off from a media-relations job. She closed her first sale in February and has three more in contract. Her first client was a close friend whom she helped buy a home. She has gained others through social media and word of mouth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am seeing insane demand and very little inventory," she said. "I know there's a lot of competition out there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diana Dorel Gutierrez took her real-estate exam last March, just before the testing center closed because of the pandemic. When she joined a brokerage in the Phoenix area, co-workers warned it wouldn't be easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They said, 'You don't have any idea what you're in for. This is the worst time to be an agent [for buyers] and the best time if you're the listing agent,'" Ms. Dorel Gutierrez said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Dorel Gutierrez, who also works as a spiritual and relationship coach, has closed five deals so far. She has found clients through social media, referrals and leads from <span class="companylink">Zillow Group Inc</span>. Her colleagues call her and the other agents who joined the brokerage last spring the "pandemic babies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you can do it in this industry at this time," she said, "you can do anything."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer spending highlights a relatively light week for economic data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. existing-home sales are expected to take a step back in February, hampered by low inventories, rising prices and a spell of bad weather in parts of the country. Even with a monthly decrease, sales are likely to have remained above their pre-pandemic pace, spurred by low mortgage rates and strong demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell appears virtually on Capitol Hill Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss the central bank's response to Covid-19. Mr. Powell last week pledged to continue easy-money policies until the U.S. economy rebounds further from the pandemic, though mounting optimism about the speed of the recovery and the possibility of rising inflation have left investors skeptical about Fed plans for interest rates and bond purchases.[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/federal-reserve-interest-rates-bond-purchases-march-2021-11615917632]
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surveys of purchasing managers for March are expected to indicate that the eurozone economy was in recession during the first quarter while the U.S. recovery accelerated, with services-sector performance key to the divergence—the eurozone's contracting, its U.S. counterpart recording stronger growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. new orders for durable goods are expected to rise for the 10th straight month in February, underscoring strong demand for manufactured goods and a solid rebound in factory activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New applications for jobless benefits are hovering near the pandemic's lowest levels[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-03-18-2021-11616022152]. Economists are forecasting a decline in jobless claims during the week ending March 20, which would suggest further gains for the labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. personal income and consumer spending could decline in February, payback from a stimulus-driven surge a month earlier alongside winter storms in parts of the country. "The weakness in income and spending is likely to be temporary," economists at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> said in a research note. "Disposable income is going to rise sharply in March and April as the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan leads to another round of direct stimulus payments."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Mike Bird </div><div>480 words</div><div>19 March 2021</div><div>06:19</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government of New Zealand is unhappy with surging house prices[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-zealands-new-leader-wants-to-go-further-than-most-to-curb-housing-prices-1509533271] and wants the central bank to take more responsibility. Though the new requirement that it factor the prices into its policies falls short of changing the bank's mandate, it will muddle its decision making—and would do the same if it were adopted elsewhere[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-real-rally-to-watch-isnt-in-stocks-11615457994].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of housing and the price of houses aren't the same thing. Clearly, the rampant rise in house prices across New Zealand—up by more than 100% over the past 15 years—has outstripped growth in average weekly earnings of more like 60%. But rental prices have risen only 40% over the same period. The latter is already included in the consumer-price index that the central bank targets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, rental prices have risen more sharply for some places than others and perhaps for some property types, too. But then the argument becomes even more absurd. How much should a central banker weigh the rental price of one- and two-bedroom apartments and houses in popular cities when setting an interest rate that applies to every homeowner, home buyer, renter, manufacturer and farmer in the country?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some central banks have been given an expanded role in tackling house-price booms but, crucially, with credit-related tools specific to the housing market. Monetary policy is a poor tool for fine-tuning different sectors of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If governments are seriously concerned about house prices, many tools are within their reach. New Zealand's Social Policy Evaluation and Research Unit suggested in 2017 that the country's land-use regulations were driving up prices[https://thehub.swa.govt.nz/assets/documents/Impact_land_use-fullreport_110717.pdf] and particularly influencing places where prices have risen moderately and places where they have surged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Zealand's ratio of debt to gross domestic product fell by 15 percentage points between mid-2012 and early 2019, even as interest rates declined. If central banks have to sustain economic growth on their own without substantial fiscal help, then it shouldn't be a surprise when interest rates have an outsize effect on market conditions. Milton Friedman once said that low interest rates were a sign that monetary policy had been too tight, rather than too loose. Similarly, house prices running well above earnings may be a sign that economic policy overall has been too austere, not too stimulative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monetary policy is a blunt tool even for tackling relatively broad objectives like employment and consumer-price inflation. Giving central bankers an additional and probably contradictory objective to struggle with is the wrong move.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are surging for the raw materials used to build American homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber, one of the biggest costs in home-building after land and labor, has never been more expensive and is more than twice the typical price for this time of year. Crude oil, a starting point for paint, drain pipe, roof shingles and flooring, has shot up more than 80% since October. Copper, which carries water and electricity throughout houses, costs about a third more than it did in the autumn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for granite, insulation, concrete blocks and common brick have all pushed to records in 2021, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistic's producer-price index, which measures the change in prices that producers receive for their output. Drywall and ceramic tiles are short of records but have also climbed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paintmaker Sherwin-Williams Co. and flooring manufacturer <span class="companylink">Mohawk Industries Inc</span>. as well as builders D.R. Horton Inc. and <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. have been raising prices to pass along higher costs. They can thank historically low borrowing costs, federal stimulus payments and a hunt for yield that has sent investors barreling into the home-rental business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whoever the home buyers are, they have been able to pay for it," said Todd Tomalak, who tracks building products for John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>, which built more than 1,600 rentals last year and plans to construct another 2,000 houses this year, said its lumber bill is between $20,000 and $25,000 per house, up from about $10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Fortunately, we've been in a rental-rate growing environment, and that has kept us yield neutral," said Jack Corrigan, the company's chief investment officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are watching all corners of the economy for signs of stimulus driving a pickup in inflation. They are finding it in housing, where rising input prices are translating into higher costs for consumer goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> policy makers say they haven't seen enough of a jump in the price of goods and services to alter their course of holding interest rates near zero and pumping cash into the economy, which remains in recession and plagued by unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rock-bottom mortgage rates have made owning a house more affordable, while the Fed's purchasing of mortgage-backed securities has spurred lending. Lower household spending during the lockdown and federal stimulus checks have helped people accumulate down payments. House hunters are bidding up properties alongside legions of investors who are buying and building a growing share of America's houses and renting them out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building-supply chains weren't prepared when Americans began swarming model homes and Home Depots in April. Sawmills and factories had shut down like most other workplaces early in the lockdown. A spate of hurricanes knocked out Gulf Coast facilities that produce polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, raising prices to records for the material used for waste pipes and siding, according to ICIS, which tracks chemical commodities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppliers never caught up. Now building permits for residential construction are being issued at their highest rate since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">CanWel Building Materials Group Ltd</span>., which distributes building supplies in Canada and the Western U.S., has enough orders for rot-resistant wood to keep its lumber-treating facilities running at capacity through 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're sold out. We can't take on any more business this year," Chief Executive Amar Doman told investors last week. "Everything that we're producing is sold."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span> says that rising lumber prices have added $24,000 to the cost of building the average single-family home and about $9,000 per apartment. The lobbying group last week asked Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to seek immediate remedies to boost production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Current prices represent an intolerable and frequently insurmountable financial burden to home builders and contractors," the group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives with <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>, the country's largest home builder, said they are paying more for lumber as well as shingles and facing short supplies of windows and appliances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are increasing our prices in general, but we balance our moves in prices relative to affordability and what we think our buyers can actually afford in terms of the monthly payments," finance chief Bill Wheat said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders boosted prices for nearly three quarters of all floor plans offered during January, according to <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>, compared with 54% of models that became more expensive in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders are finding limits to what customers will pay. In Raleigh, N.C., Brant Chesson, CEO of Homes by Dickerson, said that last month he lost six customers in one day after he raised prices to cover higher lumber bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even though there still is a great sales pace, we lose customers every day," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>2085 words</div><div>16 March 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residential real-estate market is on its biggest tear since 2006, just before the housing bubble burst and set off a global recession. Yet in nearly every meaningful way, today's market is the inverse of the previous boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                        Anthony Lamacchia, a broker and owner of a real-estate company near Boston, entered the industry in 2004. Home buyers were trading up to bigger, more expensive houses after barely a year, he said. Many buyers paid small down payments, or none at all. When housing prices stopped rising, the market collapsed. By 2009, Mr. Lamacchia was working with clients desperate to dump the homes he had just helped them buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, he said, housing demand in the Boston suburbs is stronger than he has ever seen. Lamacchia Realty reached $1 billion in sales last year for the first time. Buyers have higher credit ratings these days. They are flusher and are putting down more cash up front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On $1 million purchases, people are putting down $500,000," he said. "You didn't see that before."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2020, sales of previously owned U.S. homes surged to their highest level in 14 years, and many economists forecast sales to rise again this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mid-2000s, loose mortgage-lending standards enabled borrowers with poor credit histories to purchase homes beyond their means, sometimes with mortgages that required low payments in the early years of the loan. Too much new construction led to an oversupply of houses. Financial firms packaged these risky mortgages as securities and sold them to investors. When more homeowners started defaulting on their mortgages, lenders suffered large losses and the entire financial system froze up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many paid a big price. Between 2006 and 2014, about 9.3 million households went through foreclosure, gave up their home to a lender or sold in a distressed sale, according to a 2015 estimate from the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current housing boom is far more stable than the last one and poses fewer systemic risks, economists say. A downside: There are more barriers to entry, and it's more difficult for buyers who aren't already homeowners to make that first purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most real-estate analysts agree that the pandemic helped ignite the current boom as some urbanites looked to leave crowded cities like New York and San Francisco for cheaper cities or for more space in the suburbs while working from home. When lockdowns began lifting last year, home sales took off: June sales surged nearly 21% over the prior month, the biggest monthly increase on record going back to 1968. That milestone lasted only a month, when July sales rose almost 25% from June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Covid has catalyzed a rethinking of where we live, and why we live there, and where we work, and how we work," said Rich Barton, chief executive of online real-estate company <span class="companylink">Zillow Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market watchers also say that a number of longer-term trends are at play that should keep the housing market hot, or at least steady, even after Covid-19-related demand fades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennials, the largest living adult generation, continue to age into their prime homebuying years and plunk down savings for homes. At the same time, the market is critically undersupplied. New-home construction hasn't kept up with household demand, and homeowners are holding on to their houses longer. Buyers are competing fiercely for a limited number of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage lenders, meanwhile, are maintaining tight standards -- buyers are drawn to the market by historically low interest rates, not by easy access to credit. Rising home values also mean that even if homeowners can't afford their mortgage payments, they can likely sell their homes for a profit rather than face foreclosure. Financial firms are still packaging mortgages as securities, but the vast majority of those mortgages today have government backing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest winners in today's boom are people who already own homes, who gained a collective $1.5 trillion in equity in 2020 from a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. They have also saved money by refinancing their mortgages at record low rates. Many have started renovation projects or bought vacation homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate brokers, home builders and mortgage lenders are also riding the wave. The S&amp;P Homebuilders Select Industry index is up 135% over the past year, outpacing the S&amp;P 500's 66% gain. Between July and December, eight of the 30 largest U.S. mortgage lenders announced plans to go public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those trying to break into the market for the first time have rarely found it more difficult. U.S. house prices soared 10.8% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier on a seasonally adjusted basis, the biggest annual increase in data going back to 1992, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>. The median home purchase price climbed above $300,000 last year for the first time. Nearly one in four home buyers between April and June bought houses priced at $500,000 or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less-expensive homes became harder to find. Sales of homes priced at $250,000 and below declined in 2020 from a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers are struggling to afford down payments. For many renters who lost jobs in 2020, homeownership is even further out of reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing has become a luxury good," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of real-estate brokerage Redfin Corp. "The economy seems to have officially split in two. There is so much hardship in one part, and then there's just an absolute mad dash to buy houses in the other part." The homeownership rate stood at 65.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020, up from 63.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market's biggest near-term concern is rising mortgage interest rates, which recently hit their highest level since July and cooled the market slightly. With bond yields rising as investors anticipate a post-Covid rebound, many economists expect mortgage rates to continue creeping upward this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the home sales in the past year were likely sales that would have happened in the next few years but were accelerated due to Covid-19, real-estate agents say. That could augur a slowdown in demand going forward. Some people who are working from home are also likely waiting for their companies to decide on future remote-work policies. They might opt to stay put if they are required to commute to the office daily in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists also caution that the shortage of homes on the market could limit the number of sales this year. Spring is typically the busiest season for home sales, as families aim to move before the start of a new school year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing markets in New York City and San Francisco, two of the country's priciest areas, slumped last year as some residents moved away and the pace of people moving into those cities slowed. New York City home prices in January fell 3.1% from a year earlier, according to listings website StreetEasy's price index. In San Francisco, the median sale price in January declined 1.9% from a year earlier, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the pandemic looks likely to keep housing demand strong. In Sacramento, Calif., an influx of buyers from the San Francisco Bay Area helped push up the median sales price 21.3% in January from a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That buying interest helped Rachel Voss, an attorney, upgrade her living situation and remain in the city she has called home since 2003. Ms. Voss sold her house in November for $409,900, nearly $155,000 more than what she paid for it in 2008. Her new house, a three-bedroom, has twice the space of the old one, and she bought it with a lower interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firms lending on all these home purchases are thriving. One of those is run by Rick Arvielo, chief executive of the Orange County, Calif.-based mortgage lender New American Funding. During the previous housing boom, he wondered if he was blowing a big opportunity. Competitors were getting rich making subprime mortgages, and he considered getting into the business. His wife and co-founder, Patty Arvielo, refused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business slowed during the housing crash and the Arvielos didn't take a paycheck from mid-2007 until early 2009, but their higher underwriting standards during the boom helped them survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2020, lenders had more demand than they could handle. Homeowners rushed to refinance at lower interest rates and buyers flocked to the market. Mortgage originations rose to a record high in the fourth quarter, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span>. About seven out of every 10 of those mortgages went to borrowers with high credit scores above 760.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The refinance market has slowed in recent weeks as mortgage rates have ticked higher. So Mr. Arvielo said his business is pivoting to focus more on home purchases, especially for millennials and minority buyers. "That's where you're going to see a lot of the growth," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike in the building boom of the mid-2000s, a deficit of homes for sale is playing a big role in the current spike in prices. New-home construction hasn't kept up with demand in recent years, as builders took years to recover from the financial crisis and faced shortages of land and labor. Those shortages and rising material costs continue to hinder builders as they increase production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing starts rose in 2020, new-home construction per U.S. household in December was still more than 20% below its average level in the late 1990s, according to Jordan Rappaport, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homebuying demand is so high that many builders are limiting the number of homes they sell at a time, to ensure they don't sell more than they can build. They are also raising prices. The median new-home sales price was $346,400 in January, up 5.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the hottest market I've ever seen," said Sean Chandler, president of the central Texas division at home builder Chesmar Homes. "The buyers that come in are like, 'I just want a home. I don't care at this point what it costs.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists say a decline in demand would be welcome as a way to slow price growth. Even with borrowing rates near 3% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, much of the benefit to buyers is offset by rising prices. In the fourth quarter, the typical monthly mortgage payment ticked upward to $1,040, from $1,020 a year earlier, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said, even though mortgage rates declined nearly a full percentage point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Urban Institute projects that by 2040, each generation will have a homeownership rate lower than the preceding generation had at the same age. That means younger Americans could struggle to build household wealth compared with previous generations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeownership gap between white and Black households has also grown in the past decade, and the Urban Institute projects the Black homeownership rate will decline between 2020 and 2040.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some first-time buyers are being priced out of the market or have been forced to stretch financially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, which boasts some of the fastest home-price appreciation in the country, Pearl and Andrew Kleinhans saved for two years to buy their first home. But even with $200,000 saved for a down payment, they kept losing out last fall in bidding wars with cash buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They wanted more space than the 1,200-square-foot rental apartment they shared with their 12-year-old son, two dogs and a cat, and they wanted to stay in the neighborhood for their son's school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They started with a budget of $600,000, but ended up having to spend $850,000 in January for a four-bedroom home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What can you do?" Ms. Kleinhans said. "It was a bit out of our price range, or what I intended to spend. But that's just what you have to do in order to get your foot in the door."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Korea likely overtook Italy in gross national income per capita in 2020, a fact that made national news when announced by <span class="companylink">the Bank of Korea</span> in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having overtaken a <span class="companylink">G-7</span> economy in income, it has undeniably joined the rich world. But it now has some serious rich-world economic problems to deal with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the country's most pernicious economic challenges is epitomized by its latest political scandal. Employees of <span class="companylink">Korea Land and Housing Corp</span>., a state-run developer, are suspected of buying up land to capitalize on insider information about new public construction projects. House prices and household debt have surged in Korea, posing a serious threat to the country's growth potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> projects that for the period between 2018 and 2025, U.S. gross domestic product growth will average out at 1.6% a year, compared with 2.1% for South Korea. That gap of half a percentage point is the lowest on record, and would mean Korea's convergence with the U.S. is slowing to a crawl. Korea is now rich by global standards, but its GDP per capita in 2019 stood at $28,675, according to <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> data based on 2010 exchange rates, still only just half the U.S. level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's parlous demographics—South Korea's total fertility rate is the world's lowest[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-covid-baby-bust-could-reverberate-for-decades-11614962945], falling to just 0.84 in 2020—are a major drag, but not the whole story. Korean population growth has been lower than that of the U.S. for almost all of the last three decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the country is at risk of falling into a balance-sheet trap of the variety encountered by Japan in the 1990s, which happens when all sectors of the economy try to trim their spending at the same time. Korean households have a debt servicing ratio of 12.8%, well above the U.S. rate of 7.6%, or Germany's 6.1%. At 110% of GDP, the debt of Korea's nonfinancial corporations is just a fraction below the record levels recorded in 1999, during the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More generous government spending would help. Though unemployment[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/asias-most-radical-left-wing-economic-program-faces-a-harsh-reality-11550652596] rose to a 21-year high in January, public spending during Covid-19 has been restrained. At 4.2% of GDP, the country's fiscal deficit was the fourth lowest in the <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span> last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government last year increased capital-gains taxes[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/koreas-radical-housing-boom-crackdown-is-a-sign-of-things-to-come-11594808708] on house flipping, one of dozens of increasingly strict measures that have nevertheless failed to halt surging prices and debt. Plans to build more than 836,000 housing units in the next four years are ambitious, but whatever effect they have on prices will take time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Korea's achievements in breaking into the ranks of the world's richest countries are impressive—but it will need to do much more than just rest on its laurels if it wants to keep marching higher up through the income ranks.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Orla McCaffrey </div><div>1016 words</div><div>12 March 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. homeowners extracted more cash from their properties through cash-out refinancings in 2020 than in any year since the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. homeowners cashed out $152.7 billion in home equity last year, a 42% increase from 2019 and the most since 2007, according to mortgage-finance giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. It was a blockbuster year for mortgage originations in general as well: Lenders churned out more mortgages than ever in 2020, fueled by about $2.8 trillion in refis, according to mortgage-data firm <span class="companylink">Black Knight Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some borrowers viewed cash-out refis as a way to cushion themselves against an uncertain economy last year. Others wanted to build and redecorate, and being stuck at home gave them the time to do the paperwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners also had more equity available to tap: Though home prices tend to fall during economic downturns, they jumped during the Covid-19 recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The support coming from home equity is unparalleled in helping smooth out the degradations from Covid," said Susan Wachter, an economist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania. "For those who are in the position to refinance, it's a major source of support."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median existing-home price rose to about $310,000 in December, an increase of almost 13% from December 2019. The acceleration in price growth has spread past cities to suburban and rural areas as people re-evaluate where they want to live during and after the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash-out refis got a bad rap after they exploded in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. Borrowers tapped their homes like they were ATMs.When home prices plunged, they were left owing more than their homes were worth. Now, in 2021, many economists expect home prices to keep growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are genuinely a lot of people who want to buy homes to live in," said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>. "They're not just buying them to buy them or speculating that home prices will continue to rise. People are buying because they want them and they're not trying to sell again the next year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates -- the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell below 3% for the first time last year -- also made cash-out refis appealing. They could become less popular if mortgage rates continue to rise, as they have in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash-out refis let borrowers essentially swap their current mortgage with a fresh one that has a higher balance. That allows a homeowner to pay off the old mortgage and still have cash left over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median credit score of new refis last year approached 800, near the top of the scoring range, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span>. That includes refis in which the borrower didn't take cash out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Todd Kennedy lowered the mortgage interest rate on his North Texas home by almost a percentage point when he refinanced late last year. Mr. Kennedy, who has a credit score around 780, also cashed out about $30,000 in equity to pay for home improvements including repairs to his home's foundation and new flooring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kennedy said he started considering a refi when his mortgage company, <span class="companylink">Mr. Cooper Group Inc</span>., reached out with an offer in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They said, 'Hey, you've already got equity. We can do a lower rate and get cash back,' " Mr. Kennedy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wendi Comello of St. Louis closed on a cash-out refi last week. It was made easier by her home's price appreciation. She bought it for close to $95,000 in 2014. It appraised for about $150,000 this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Comello used the cash to pay off two loans worth a combined $8,000, including one that helped her with the down payment on her <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> mortgage. She also plans to pay off credit-card debt and renovate her 1950s-style kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Comello's credit score in the 600s prevented her from locking in a lower rate. The refi pushed her mortgage rate up to 4.3% from 4%, and her monthly payment went up by about $50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There can be other pitfalls to cash-out refis. When homeowners refinance into new 30-year mortgages, they essentially reset the clock on their payments. Over time they can add years to the life of their loan and as a result end up paying tens of thousands of dollars in additional interest, not to mention closing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the 2017 tax overhaul said that borrowers typically can't deduct the interest on the cash-out portion of a refi unless it is used to improve a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some borrowers like the idea of paying off credit-card debt with their cash-out refis, since mortgage interest rates are much lower than the typical credit-card rate. But a mortgage, unlike a credit card, is a secured loan. That means that borrowers who fall behind on credit-card payments don't risk losing an asset, while borrowers who fall behind on home loans risk foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Henning, a mortgage loan officer in Gig Harbor, Wash., said a number of his customers have taken out larger-than-usual sums of cash to do major renovations or additions. Tight housing inventory -- the number of homes for sale is at an all-time low -- has made it hard for families who are looking for larger homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They can't find a house to move into, so they've basically decided to make their homes work long term," Mr. Henning said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, borrowers who did major cash-out refis withdrew an average of $50,000 last year, down from $59,000 the year before, according to the <span class="companylink">New York Fed</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the housing-market crash that followed the financial crisis, almost 90% of borrowers who refinanced chose to extract cash. Last year, about one-third of refinancers chose the cash-out option, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Taylor </div><div>1880 words</div><div>11 March 2021</div><div>07:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Gewirtz never got used to the heat, even after 15 years in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Gewirtz, who grew up in New Jersey, and his wife, Denise Amrich, liked their adopted hometown of Palm Bay, Fla., and probably would have stayed if it weren't for the "brutal" hurricanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Staring at those tracker maps for weeks before a hurricane hits starts to create a stress level," said Mr. Gewirtz, a technology columnist in his early 50s. "It's three weeks of wondering whether you're going to have a house at the end."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple evacuated their home in the path of 2017's Hurricane Irma, kept driving until they got to Oregon and decided to stay. They listed their Palm Bay house for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida, it turns out, isn't for everyone. But you would never know it from the PR coming out of the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the pandemic, Florida politicians and real-estate developers have promoted the narrative that hedge-fund execs and tech workers, in search of warm weather and low taxes[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/in-florida-homeowners-come-for-the-weather-and-stay-for-the-tax-relief-11578501325], are abandoning New York and California en masse and putting down roots in Florida. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has used <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> to publicly court Silicon Valley tech moguls, inviting Elon Musk to Miami for a discussion about tunneling under the city. In December, when venture capitalist Delian Asparouhov tweeted a suggestion about moving Silicon Valley to Miami, the mayor retweeted it to his followers with the response, "How can I help?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far less discussed, however, is the fact that each year nearly as many people move out of Florida as move in. They are fleeing hurricanes, heat and escalating home prices. While Covid-19 has prompted some out-of-staters to buy homes in Florida, the state's population growth has slowed in the pandemic to its lowest rate since 2014, according to the state's November 2020 Demographic Estimating Conference. Between April 2019 and April 2020, the state's population increased by 1.83%, or 387,479 people. Between April 2020 and April 2021, however, the population is expected to grow by 1.38%, or 297,851 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were fewer moves into Florida from other states in 2020 than any time in the last nine years, according to an annual study of migration patterns from the national moving company <span class="companylink">Atlas Van Lines</span>. The study also found that roughly 50% of the Florida moves in 2020 were inbound versus outbound, down from 60% in 2015. By contrast, in 2020, North Carolina had approximately 65% inbound moves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlas data shows that in Florida, "as many people are moving in as are moving out," said Barry Schellenberg, <span class="companylink">Atlas Van Lines</span>' president and COO, "which kind of surprised me because when you hear some of the news stories about the number of people moving to Florida, I expected that the number [of incoming moves] was going to be greater."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may be news to the general public, but it is no surprise to demographers. Florida's overall population has grown steadily for decades, but over the past 20 years, the state has also seen large numbers of people depart each year, with many returning to their home states, said Hamilton Lombard, a demographer at the <span class="companylink">University of Virginia</span>. "A lot of people go down there and realize that they don't like hurricanes," said Mr. Lombard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This fact is belied by the state's booming luxury real-estate market: Luxury home prices across the state have exploded in the pandemic, due in part to wealthy out-of-staters purchasing Florida homes. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner reportedly paid $32 million for land on Miami's exclusive Indian Creek Island. They did not respond to a request for comment. "Rocky" star Sylvester Stallone spent $35.375 million for a waterfront compound in Palm Beach, a few months after selling his California home. New York hedge funder (and <span class="companylink">GameStop</span> short seller) Gabe Plotkin paid $44 million for two adjacent houses on North Bay Road in Miami Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is particularly strong in Palm Beach, where former President Donald Trump is now living and which has become popular with finance executives. Palm Beach County saw a huge spike in home sales in February, with more than twice as many contracts signed on condos as the same month of last year, and 95.4% more on single-family homes, according to a <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> market report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other areas of Florida, while seeing booming high-end sales, have slowness at the lower end of the market. In Miami-Dade County, for example, there were 197 contracts signed for single-family homes over $1 million in January, more than double the 77 in the same month of last year, according to a <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> report. During the same period, contracts for homes under $500,000 plummeted 56%. In the Naples area, there were 624 single-family-homes sales over $2 million in January, a 62% jump from the same month of the prior year, while sales under $300,000 sank 20%, according to data from the Naples Area Board of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these high-end buyers already own homes in Florida, either as full-time residents or "snowbirds," real-estate agents said. Despite the narrative that Northeasterners are fleeing en masse to Florida, the state's Demographic Estimating Conference found only a "very slight" increase in migration from the Northeast since the pandemic started, according to Stefan Rayer, of the <span class="companylink">University of Florida</span>'s Bureau of Economic and Business Research. "It's not really moving the needle," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the purchasers who are new to Florida, it is not clear how many will make Florida their full-time residence, and if they do, how long they will stay. Peter Zalewski, founder of the Miami real-estate consulting firm Condo Vultures, said he's observed over the years that many Florida transplants don't end up staying long. "A lot of people don't last more than five years," he said. "They go home." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Rim, 25, is one of the newcomers who is unsure if his move will be permanent. Founder of the New York-based education and college consulting company Command Education, Mr. Rim usually meets with his clients virtually, so he decided on a whim in January to relocate to Miami from Manhattan. He spent two weekends searching for a Miami condo. When he found a two-bedroom with a balcony he liked in the Surfside area, he submitted an offer within hours, ultimately closing for roughly $4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rim said he views the venture as an experiment with Florida living. "This is a time to try it out, to see how it is for a year or two," he said. "I probably will be back in New York, but who knows?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He put his two-bedroom, two-bathroom Tribeca apartment on the market for $3 million, but said he is in no rush to sell. Meanwhile, he is planning to open a Miami office but said his business will remain based in New York. "It's just easier," he said. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would you relocate to Florida? Tell us why or why not by joining the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out-of-state buyers may be spending big bucks on Florida properties, but many are also hanging on to homes elsewhere. Jessica Cunningham, a 44-year-old interior designer, lives primarily with her husband and four children in the Chicago suburbs. They have vacationed in the Palm Beach area for years, and have been spending even more time there during Covid. This summer, they started looking for a house in the area to buy as a vacation property. They found the market to be "insane," with homes selling in hours, she said. Finally in November, they paid about $1.1 million for a three-bedroom house in West Palm Beach. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lowe in his Georgia home. PHOTO: Deborah Whitlaw Llewellyn for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They considered moving to Florida permanently, but ended up not even keeping the house. By the time they finished renovating it, she said, they realized that "the market is so crazy that we could make some money off it." A few weeks ago they listed the house for $1.45 million with Lilly Leas Ferreira of Brown Harris Stevens and it sold to an all-cash buyer for full price before even going on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, this kind of rapid home-price appreciation is one of the factors prompting people to leave Florida, said Glenda Nichols, a real-estate agent at Barn Owl Realty in the North Georgia mountain town of Ellijay. Since the pandemic started, Ms. Nichols said she's noticed a 30% increase in clients relocating out of Florida, citing the Sunshine State's traffic, heat, humidity and increasing housing costs. "You put all that together, and a lot of retirees are coming out of Florida and coming to North Georgia."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Ms. Nichols's clients, David Lowe, sold his longtime home outside Sarasota, Fla., in 2019 for $375,000 and purchased a similar-sized house on a larger piece of land in North Georgia for $180,000. A semiretired metal sculptor, he spent another $50,000 building an art studio on the forested property. For now, he still has a small place in Florida, but in the next few years he plans to make Georgia his full-time home. From New England, he wanted a change from Florida's flat landscape and "smoking hot" weather. "I'd wake up every morning wondering, 'Now, why am I still in Florida?' " he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Georgia and the Carolinas have become increasingly popular alternatives to Florida for retirees in the past 15 years, said Jon Rork, professor of Economics at Reed College in Oregon. He said many Northerners initially retire to Florida, but end up moving back home or relocating elsewhere in the Southeast, becoming what are known as "half-backs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan and Carol Ward moved to the Sarasota area from Massachusetts about eight years ago. But they found the summers "stifling hot," and they missed the four seasons, said Mr. Ward, a principal at the planning and design firm Sasaki. This fall, they bought a four-bedroom, 3½-bath home in the mountains outside Greenville, S.C., in the golf community The Cliffs at Glassy. The area has distinct but mild seasons. Summer is "still hot in South Carolina," Mr. Ward said, "but it's not as severe or as long as in Florida."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property Jordan Mazer bought in December is the classic Venice beach house in more ways than one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $2.225 million clapboard house is close enough to a local surf break that Mr. Mazer, a 33-year-old human-resources executive for a videogame company, can run to it with his surfboard tucked under his arm. Another thing that makes his property emblematic of the neighborhood: He paid $213,000 less than the buyer in 2018, and $450,000 less than the buyer in 2016. The home, for which he paid over $1,000 a square foot, is near the beach but also near the Venice boardwalk, where scores of homeless people are now living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property market in Venice, once a working-class community that experienced an extraordinary run-up in prices[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/venice-beach-is-a-hot-place-to-live-so-why-is-its-housing-supply-shrinking-1500206400] from 2012 through 2019, is taking a pause. From 2012 to 2019, prices grew by an average of about 17% a year in Venice, vastly outpacing price growth in the rest of Los Angeles, according to an analysis by real-estate website Zillow. Those trends reversed in July, when price growth across Los Angeles began to outpace price growth in Venice. Throughout the pandemic, while area home prices rose in neighborhoods such as Brentwood, Pacific Palisades and the beaches of Malibu, homes over $3 million in Venice have been a tougher sell, local agents say. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price paid per-square-foot for a single-family home in Venice dropped by 5.7% in 2020, compared with the year prior, according to Jonathan Miller, president of appraisal company Miller Samuel and the author of the Elliman Report, a market study. By contrast, per-square-foot prices for single-family homes in upscale parts of the Greater Los Angeles area showed an increase of 3.2%, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory has also grown in Venice. There were 43.2% more single-family homes on the market in 2020 than there were the year prior, according to the report. Some agents blame the shift on pandemic buyers looking for larger homes outside of Venice. Juliette Hohnen, an agent with <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, said that Venice's draw has long been its urban-style living, cool stores and restaurants, all hard hit by the pandemic. That has prodded some residents to abscond to the suburban ambience of Santa Monica, Pacific Palisades, and Topanga Canyon, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a number of local real-estate agents cited another reason for the Venice market's troubles: the city's growing homeless population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm sure a lot of it is the homeless situation, but it is probably also the overpriced listing situation," said CJ Cole, an agent with The Agency who has specialized in Venice for over 30 years. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2020, Venice, a neighborhood of just over 3 square miles, was host to 1,981 homeless people, up 57% from 2019. The homeless population in Los Angeles County rose by 12.7% during the same period, according to data from the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On March 17, 2020, in response to the Covid crisis, the Los Angeles City Council approved a measure suspending enforcement of laws that prohibited people from leaving tents assembled during the day, thus legalizing encampments that have sprouted throughout Venice and other parts of Los Angeles. Mike Bonin, the 11th-district council member who serves the Venice area, said homelessness is increasing across Los Angeles and consequently is also growing in Venice. "Another reason is there is open space on the beach to sleep," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm sure the fact that people are living on the street is impacting real-estate values where it is most concentrated," said Mr. Bonin. The solution isn't to outlaw tents or encampments, Mr. Bonin said. Instead, "I want to build more homeless housing and homeless shelters in Venice" and throughout the West Side. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Klaus Moeller, a co-owner of a <span class="companylink">Ben &amp; Jerry's</span> ice-cream franchise in the heart of the Venice Boardwalk, said that as the encampment has grown throughout the Covid crisis, his sales dropped by 70% because neither visitors nor local families come to his store anymore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were always hippies, skateboarders and people smoking pot" on the boardwalk, Mr. Moeller said. Today, he finds the scene more menacing, saying he has witnessed drug dealing and stepped over hypodermic needles on the beach. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venice's identity as a bastion of luxury and chic was ignited in 2012, when real-estate prices began skyrocketing. Prices per-square-foot peaked in the first quarter of 2016 at $1,287, said Mr. Miller, the appraiser. Today, the average price-per-square-foot is $1,050, said Mr. Miller, noting that it is typical for price-per-square foot to drift lower when home size grows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology companies such as Snapchat and <span class="companylink">Google</span> leased commercial space in Venice, burnishing the area's reputation as the epicenter of Southern California's tech industry. Developers bought up small cottages and transformed them into larger, modern luxury homes. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$2.695 million // 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 2,330 square feet</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property comes with high hedges for privacy and is steps from the heart of shopping and dining on Abbot Kinney. Listing agent: Juliette Hohnen, <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russ Cletta, a 56-year-old landscape architect, and his partner Harry Gundersen, a 56-year-old computer visual-effects artist, moved to Venice in 1992. In 2003, the couple paid $430,000 for a 2,336-square-foot home built in 1909, as part of a larger deal in which they bought an adjacent lot and cottage (and a friend bought a lot adjacent to that). The couple spent roughly $300,000 on renovations of their residence, Mr. Cletta said</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home has dramatically increased in value. Tami Pardee, whose brokerage is based in Venice, didn't visit the property but, based on square footage and location, estimated its value at roughly $3 million. If the couple had put the home on the market in late 2017 or early 2018, when Ms. Pardee said that similar homes were in peak demand, she estimated it might have fetched $3.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some of the forces that have contributed to that valuation have caused the area "to lose some of its funk," Mr. Cletta said. Abbot Kinney, Venice's famous shopping street, is "too bougey" for their taste, Mr. Cletta said, using a slang term for bourgeois and fancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oliver Damavandi, a real-estate developer, rode the sea change in the area with an epic house flip. In 2015, he paid $1.425 million for a Venice house he lived in, then renovated "top to bottom," and sold in 2019 for $4.995 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Damavandi wants lightning to strike again, though it may be trickier. In 2015, he paid $1.53 million for another Venice property that he has since rebuilt with "lots of Covid amenities," including a pool and tropical landscaping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Damavandi's second house first came on the market in late 2019 asking $5.8 million. In February of last year, it was listed with a brokerage at $5.548 million. He didn't rush to lower the price because he enjoyed living in the home himself throughout the pandemic, he said. In late January, he relisted it with a new agent, Ms. Hohnen, and a slightly lower price, of $5.395 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The handful of houses in the $5 million to $6 million range that sold in 2020 were on the market for an average of 63 days, Mr. Miller said, making Mr. Damavandi's listing an outlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Damavandi believes his house will now find a buyer as the Covid crisis subsides. He said the home is near bars, restaurants and shops, and said it is less affected by the problems of living in an urban setting because it has dense foliage and is designed so the home isn't visible to the neighborhood and vice versa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mazer takes the long view on Venice, believing he got a great deal on beach property that would cost far more in Manhattan Beach or Malibu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I still believe Venice will be vastly improved in over the next 10 to 20 years," he said. "There's a lot of room for improvement."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine</span> has leased 165,000 square feet of office space on the West Side in a deal that underscores the importance of hospitals and biotechnology to the economic growth of New York in the pandemic era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labs, outpatient clinics and research space operated by the growing healthcare and medical research network will occupy three floors of Georgetown Co.'s $360 million redevelopment[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/manhattans-auto-row-is-attracting-office-developers-1461541521] of a historic building on Manhattan's Auto Row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in the 1920s, the 10-story tower at 787 11th Ave., originally was the home of the Packard Motor Co. and was purchased by Georgetown in 2015. Investors in the redevelopment include Arnold Schwarzenegger, LeBron James and billionaire William Ackman, whose <span class="companylink">Pershing Square Capital Management LP</span> moved its offices into the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mount Sinai plans to use about half of its space to operate outpatient clinics for ambulatory surgery, breast cancer, spine problems and other health conditions. The deal marks the largest expansion of the hospital's outpatient operations on the West Side since it acquired five New York medical facilities encompassing the former <span class="companylink">Continuum Health Partners</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mount Sinai plans to use the rest of its space in the building for biotech research on genome sequencing, stem cells, protein engineering and other emerging sciences. "The two main focuses will be cancer and the brain," said Eric Nestler, dean for academic and scientific affairs. "But it will extend beyond that considerably as well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mount Sinai lease will generate over $600 million in rent over its 33-year term, according to a person who was briefed on the transaction. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the coronavirus pandemic, biotech, pharmaceutical and other life-sciences businesses were growing sources of jobs and economic development in New York. Labs occupy about 2.4 million square feet of space in the city and there is almost double that amount in the pipeline, according to JLL, the real estate services firm that advised Georgetown in the Mount Sinai deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The life-sciences business is even more important to New York now because of its high growth rate and its appetite for specialized office and lab space. Most office buildings have gotten clobbered during the pandemic because of the popularity of working from home. But many life-sciences businesses can't do that because lab work requires specialized designs[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/biotech-properties-draw-billions-of-dollars-as-other-real-estate-languishes-11594728002], ventilation and other infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of Mount Sinai's research has led to medical breakthroughs and commercial applications. Antibody tests used in the treatment of Covid-19 were brought to market and commercialized by a Mount Sinai spinout, Kantaro Biosciences. Another biotech spinout, <span class="companylink">Sema4</span>, went public earlier this year through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Georgetown has separately leased more than 35,000 square feet in the building to Neri Oxman, an MIT Media Lab professor who is married to Mr. Ackman. She is going to operate a research and design lab in the office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up until recently, most of the biotech and life sciences in the city was located near the East River like the Cornell Tech development on Roosevelt Island. But that is beginning to change, thanks partly to West Side's proximity to the big pharmaceutical companies in New Jersey, according to Jonathan Schmerin, Georgetown managing principal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Like any industry cluster, these guys all want to be near each other," he said</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building at 787 11th Ave. is now completely leased. Five of its floors are leased to car dealerships including Jaguar Land Rover Manhattan and Nissan North America.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10.4% Last Year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth accelerated in December, as the number of homes on the market continued to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 10.4% in the year that ended in December, up from a 9.5% annual rate the prior month. December marked the highest annual rate of price growth since January 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House-buying demand has surged in recent months, driven by record-low interest rates.Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of the housing market, rose in 2020 to their highest annual level since 2006, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes for sale has dropped, prompting buyers to compete for houses and buoying prices. There were 1.07 million homes for sale at the end of December, down 23% from December 2019, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Peter Grant </div><div>646 words</div><div>24 February 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>., once a sleepy data firm, is the focus of a takeover battle as the hot housing market drives up the value of home- and mortgage-data services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's largest provider of information on home values, mortgages and other housing statistics for financial firms and real-estate brokers agreed this month to accept an all-cash bid of $80 a share, or about $6 billion. The bid came from private-equity firms <span class="companylink">Stone Point Capital LLC</span> and Insight Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That bid won out over a competing all-stock offer at a nominally higher value from <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>., one of the world's largest providers of commercial real-estate data and online marketplaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But CoStar wasn't ready to give up. Last week, it boosted its all-stock bid to about $96 a share at the time, or around $6.9 billion. That represented a premium of 17% to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>'s share price before CoStar made its offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If CoStar prevails, the Washington, D.C.-based data company plans to use <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> to challenge <span class="companylink">Zillow Group Inc</span>. for dominance of the multibillion-dollar online home-sales marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CoStar last year made its first push into the home-sales market by buying Homesnap Inc. for $250 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fight for control of <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> is a vivid sign of investor interest in businesses tied to the housing market, which has been roaring throughout much of the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales last year surged to their highest level in 14 years, fueled by record low interest rates and a pandemic that sent buyers searching for more spacious homes to accommodate remote work. That activity has stoked the revenue of residential brokerages like <span class="companylink">Realogy Holdings Corp</span>. and home builders like <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential real-estate-data firms also have been riding the upswing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With housing white-hot, there's inevitably going to be more demand for data: everything from for-sale housing, to residential development, and even single-family rental homes," said Ryan Tomasello, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> enjoyed a banner year in 2020. The company had $1.17 billion in revenue the first nine months of the year, compared with $1.09 billion for the first three quarters of 2019. Its database holds billions of housing-related records that banks rely on to make mortgages, and that insurance companies use to write policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its share price has more than doubled since the beginning of 2020, thanks to the housing-market rally and takeover interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data and technology-driven services are expected to become even more important to the home-buying experience in the years to come, Mr. Tomasello said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of housing demand is being driven by millennials and first-time buyers," he said. "They are the ones who are going to be more demanding of a tech-enabled home-search and home-buying experience."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest in acquiring <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> goes back to at least June, when a pair of private-equity firms made the first bid for Irvine, Ca.-based <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That bid was valued at $65 a share, or about $5.2 billion. That unsolicited bid, combined with the strong housing market, attracted the attention of other investors. Suitors included a venture of <span class="companylink">Warburg Pincus LLC</span> and the private-equity firm <span class="companylink">GTCR LLC</span>, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>'s chairman, Paul Folino, said in a written statement when the company chose Stone Point and Insight that the bid was in cash "with a high degree of regulatory certainty and a closing expected in the near term."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was before CoStar increased its bid. The board is now weighing CoStar's competing offer and a decision is expected as early as this week.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Will Parker </div><div>693 words</div><div>24 February 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demolition of Atlantic City's Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino last week was a reminder that the city's heyday as a gambling mecca has long since passed. But the recent surge in home prices there raises the prospect that the city could reclaim its status as a desirable seaside getaway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantic City home prices rose 30% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, making the New Jersey city one of the country's biggest gainers, according to the National Association of Realtors. Prices continued to rise in January, jumping 35% compared with a year earlier, according to data collected by real-estate brokerage Redfin. New Jersey gambling revenue, meanwhile, tumbled 17% in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantic City home-price gains followed efforts by local officials and real-estate investors to transform the town from a place where gamblers would try their luck at table games to a place where more people wanted to live and work permanently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They want to build up the Atlantic City economy where it's based off of businesses and activities that are not casino related," said Joshua Garay, a New York real-estate broker. Locals have pushed to create more jobs in the cybersecurity industry and to add more family friendly offerings, including a recently announced plan for an indoor water park on the boardwalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Garay is working with the owners of the former Atlantic Club Casino Hotel, which closed in 2014, to renovate its hotel and potentially to develop new condominiums. Other investors have begun building or have plans for new apartments, restaurants, hotels and other family-oriented attractions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's reimagination was already under way before the pandemic accelerated it. Buyers from the Philadelphia area in particular are helping fuel housing demand, brokers say, as many seek seaside residences to work from home during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new development 600 North Beach, a 250-unit rental apartment building near the boardwalk, opened in 2019 as the first large market-rate rental project built in Atlantic City in several decades, according to Wasseem Boraie, Boraie Development LLC's vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His firm is developing a second phase on land it acquired next door and is considering a separate second-home development, he said. "We're looking at it 10 years out," Mr. Boraie said. "I just think that the demand is going to be there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantic City isn't so much abandoning gambling as attempting a return to its roots as a popular oceanside destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initial hotels and boardwalk were built in the 19th century and tourism reached a peak in the 1920s, with a proliferation of nightclubs and restaurants and saltwater taffy treats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the city went into decline in the second half of the 20th century, it turned to gambling in the 1970s to bring back tourists and boost the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantic City offered the first legal casinos in the eastern part of the country. It became a popular destination, at least until nearby states built their own casinos and lured high rollers away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More investors have taken a chance on Atlantic City since the state took control of the city's finances in 2016, Mr. Boraie said. At that time, the city faced possible bankruptcy following the collapse of the casino industry after the last financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New projects like Bourre, a New Orleans-inspired restaurant and concert venue built on the site of a former strip club, reflect the city's reformed image. The developer, Pat Fasano, has plans for hotels, apartments and office space in the works as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developments such as these have been further encouraged by the federal Opportunity Zones program, which allows investors to defer taxes on real-estate investments in the city and other select areas under guidelines from the <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury Department</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many property investors look to the recent revival of Asbury Park, another once-rundown town on the Jersey Shore where developers now flog $1 million condos. They believe Atlantic City is ripe for a similar rebirth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth accelerated in December, as the number of homes on the market continued to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 10.4% in the year that ended in December, up from a 9.5% annual rate the prior month[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-accelerated-in-november-11611669619].

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 9.8% over the year ended in December, compared with an 8.9% increase in November. The 20-city index rose 10.1%, after an annual gain of 9.2% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With buyer interest leading to an unseasonably competitive landscape…home prices remain on a steep upward trend," said George Ratiu, senior economist at Realtor.com. <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, parent of The Wall Street Journal, operates Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected the 20-city index to gain 9.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-city index measured 19 cities in December due to transaction reporting delays in Wayne County, Mich., according to <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices</span>. Price growth accelerated in 18 of the 19 cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix had the fastest home-price growth in the country for the 19th straight month, at 14.4%, followed by Seattle at 13.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate measure of home-price growth by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> also released Tuesday found an 11.4% increase in home prices in December from a year earlier.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jon Hilsenrath </div><div>858 words</div><div>22 February 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> predicates its easy-money policies in part on the fact that its favorite measure of inflation has run more than a half percentage point below its goal for several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With inflation so low for so long, the thinking goes, the Fed can hold interest rates very low for a while to help boost the economy as it recovers from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This raises an important question: Is the central bank thinking about inflation properly?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed defines its inflation target in terms of consumer prices, such as those we pay for cars, toothpaste and haircuts. But in recent decades, prices have often climbed much faster for investment assets, such as homes and stocks, and twice led to booms and busts followed by recessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Fed does run into problems with the low interest rates it has helped to engineer, it might be because of asset prices and not consumer prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't until 2012 that the Fed adopted a numerical definition of its goal. It said it sought 2% inflation as measured by the Commerce Department's personal-consumption expenditures price index over the medium run. In other words, its measure was the cost of household goods and services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2012, this measure has averaged 1.3% annual growth -- a long time below the Fed's goal. Critics who warned the Fed's easy-money policies of the 2010s would lead to an inflation surge, a financial bubble and a collapsing dollar turned out to be flat out wrong. All the more reason to keep interest rates exceptionally low today, when the economy is struggling, the Fed's thinking goes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates are intended to spur borrowing, spending and investment, supporting economic growth and hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As society has become more affluent, more resources have gone into assets like stocks, bonds and second homes. Perhaps not coincidentally, two of the last three U.S. recessions were driven by asset price bubbles -- a tech stock boom in the late 1990s and a housing price boom in the 2000s -- that caused economic imbalances even though consumer prices made barely a peep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheap imports from abroad, among other global forces, might be holding down U.S. consumer prices while asset prices march higher, creating new risks that could sideline the economy in unexpected ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is easy to find reasons for discomfort. Tesla's stock price is up more than 300% in the past year. Copper prices are up 56%. The S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home price index is up 9.5%. Freight prices are up 215%; soybeans, 54%, lumber, 117%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes are particularly thorny. They provide a service -- we live in them -- that is measured in official consumer-price indexes. They are also the most valuable asset in the investment portfolios of many households. The investment part isn't measured in these inflation indexes. Rather than track actual home prices, the indexes estimate housing costs based on the rents paid in big cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Covid-19 decimating commerce in cities and people leaving, no wonder the Labor Department's official measure of rental housing costs in the past year rose just 2%, while home prices nationally were up at nearly five times that rate. In 2004 and 2005, as a housing bubble grew, the Labor Department measure of rents averaged gains of little more than 2% annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have faulty price measurements and policy makers linking their decisions to faulty price measurements," says Joseph Carson, a former Alliance Bernstein and Commerce Department economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While stable consumer prices are the primary focus of monetary policy, asset prices are the domain of regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed and Treasury Department are counting on monitoring systems they have set up since the 2007-2009 financial crisis to spot problems in asset prices -- such as booms driven by investor borrowing binges -- that might destabilize the financial system. It is then for regulators to figure out what to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Monetary policy should not be the first line of defense," against destabilizing asset price booms, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last September. Raising rates to tame asset bubbles, he said, could be a secondary reaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, markets and the people monitoring them don't seem very concerned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In answer to a question at his January press conference, Mr. Powell said he saw rising home prices as a temporary reaction to the Covid-19 crisis, with people switching residences to adapt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital, a $1.5 billion investment management fund, notes that in swaps markets, where companies hedge inflation and interest-rate risk, firms are pricing inflation in the 2-to-10-year horizon at about 1% a year, even further below the Fed's target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market might be complacent, she said. Or it might be saying that the risk of a pickup in inflation is no more serious than the risk of falling consumer prices, known as deflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody knows what's going to happen," she said, "especially the economists."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose in January, as the market stayed hot during the usually slower winter period and a shortage of homes for sale[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-market-stays-tight-as-homeowners-stay-put-11611226802] kept pushing home prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 0.6% in January from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.69 million, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. The January sales marked a 23.7% increase from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 2.4% monthly decline in sales of previously owned homes, which make up most of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales surged in 2020 to the highest level since 2006[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-sales-rise-to-14-year-high-in-october-11605798326], as historically-low interest rates spurred demand and buyers looked for more space. While winter is usually a slower period for home sales, economists say the pandemic disrupted the normal seasonal patterns by pushing home purchases that would have occurred last spring and summer to the fall and winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market continues to remain very strong," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. "Sales could be even higher, but the inventory is simply not there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices have climbed rapidly in recent months as buyers competed for a limited number of homes on the market. The median existing-home price rose 14.1% in January from a year earlier to $303,900, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heidi Finkelstein and Matthew Sherman bought a four-bedroom home in Plantation, Fla., in January. The new home has more outdoor space than their current house in the same city, and "it made sense for us to do this because the mortgage rates are so low," said Dr. Finkelstein, a dentist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are renovating the new house and plan to sell their current home in the summer. "I don't see the market in our neighborhood going down anytime soon," as people continue to move to Florida from other states, Dr. Finkelstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose the most month-over-month in the South, at 3.2%, and in the Midwest, at 1.9%. January sales were down from December in the Northeast and the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales were especially strong at the high end of the market, with the number of sales of homes priced at over $1 million up 77% in January compared with a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, so the January figures largely reflect purchase decisions made in December or November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes for sale frequently receive multiple offers and sell quickly, real-estate agents say. There were 1.04 million homes for sale at the end of January, the lowest on records back to 1982. The level was down 1.9% from December and down 26% from January 2020, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>. At the current sales pace, there was a 1.9-month supply of homes on the market at the end of January.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand is also strong for newly built homes, and many home builders are intentionally limiting sales in some communities due to constraints of materials, labor or land. In some metro areas, buyers are signing up for wait lists or even camping out to buy new homes as they become available, said Ali Wolf, chief economist at Zonda, a housing-market research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The question today is not how many homes can you sell, it's how many homes can you build," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of U.S. home-builder confidence rose in February after two months of declines, the National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span> said this week. Housing starts, a measure of U.S. home-building, fell 6% in January from December, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Residential permits, which can be a bellwether for future home construction, rose 10.4%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colleen Kavanagh's name was spelled incorrectly in an earlier version of this article and an accompanying slide show. Mallika Malhotra is CEO of MikiFoto + Co. An earlier version of this story referred to her as co-CEO. (Corrected on Feb. 18)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Colleen Kavanagh, an entrepreneur, and her accountant husband, Matt Guida, the town of Falmouth, Maine, is the perfect mix of city and country. The couple and their 2-year-old daughter relocated from Boston in September to Ms. Kavanagh's home state to fulfill their lifelong dream of renovating a historic home. They recently purchased a five-bedroom, 5½-bathroom, 4,500-square-foot home for $830,000 in Falmouth. "We started looking around the Portland suburbs," Ms. Kavanagh said. "But in my heart, I knew where I wanted to be."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where she wanted to be was a 32-square-mile town boasting rocky coastline, rural farmland, and, according to <span class="companylink">U.S. News &amp; World Report</span>, the No. 4 public school system in the state. Located about 5 miles from Portland, which is home to numerous James Beard Award-winning chef-led restaurants, Falmouth enjoys the duality of the rural Maine lifestyle and proximity to country clubs, Casco Bay, and the cultural offerings of the state's largest city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aided in part by the pandemic, Falmouth's market is hot and it has surpassed many of its neighbors. In the town, which has a population of just over 12,000, 77 single-family homes sold between July and October 2020, a 108% increase over the same period a year earlier, according to realtor.com data. Eight homes sold for more than $1 million. The average price per square foot is $233, up over 5% in 12 months. As of November 2020, the average listing price for a single-family home in Falmouth was $848,000, compared with $758,000 in 2017. </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the nearby town of Cumberland, which has a population of about 8,500 and where the price per square foot is $224, 34 single-family homes sold between July and October 2020, up 42% from 2019. However, only one sale exceeded $1 million. Freeport, roughly 14 miles to the north, also home to about 8,500 people, has a price per square foot of $231 and saw 32 single-family homes sold between July and October 2020, an increase of 45% over 2019, also with only one sale over $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only Yarmouth, with about 8,500 residents, which neighbors Falmouth and enjoys a similarly rated school system (<span class="companylink">U.S. News &amp; World Report</span> ranks it third in the state), has a market as robust, with sales up 80% between the July to October 2020 period compared with the same period a year earlier. However, only 18 homes sold in that July to October 2020 period, none over $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falmouth's desirability arrived at a moment when people are making decisions about how they want to live, said Michelle Libby, associate broker at Century 21. For urban refugees[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/for-these-urban-refugees-country-living-isnt-quite-second-nature-11610569831], Falmouth's blend of city access and suburban space makes it a good choice, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are the qualities in a small town that would entice you to move there from an urban community? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are arriving to the area without a specific town in mind, but are making quick decisions based on the market's competitiveness, she said. "The houses are on and off the market so quickly," Ms. Libby said, that buyers "don't have a lot of time to choose."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Ms. Kavanagh and Mr. Guida, proximity to Portland played a central role in their decision to purchase their 1912 carriage house, on which they have done $100,000 in renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We go into Portland for coffee in the morning during the week," Ms. Kavanagh said. The couple finds that they are able to take advantage of a city in ways that they were not able to do in their former Boston neighborhood of Jamaica Plain. "It has that really distinctly small-town community feel, while also being less than 10 minutes from downtown Portland."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreside Road // $1.65 million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This mid-century home was renovated in 2020. The main property includes over 4,700 square feet of finished space and a lower level that leads out to the backyard. An additional bedroom and bathroom above the garage can be used as a guesthouse or rental. The property sits on 0.71 acres and is represented by Jennifer Davies of Compass Commercial Brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winslow Road // $880,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 1790, this home offers classic Colonial details, like an original cooking hearth with iron kettle crane, wide-plank floors, and five fireplaces. Renovations have added extra square footage to this home, which now has over 3,000 square feet of space. The living room leads into a sunroom that looks out onto the property's 0.76 acres of land, and an abutting waterfront parcel may also be available for purchase. The home is represented by Hannah Holmes of <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other homeowners have fallen for Falmouth after a search of the area's competing towns. Mallika Malhotra, brand photographer and CEO of MikiFoto + Co, and her husband, Sunil Malhotra, a surgeon, purchased their $2.11 million home, which has four bedrooms, three bathrooms, and two ½ bathrooms, in September 2019. Dr. Malhotra, who had accepted a position at Maine Medical, came to the area first. Mrs. Malhotra followed in March 2020 with the couple's three sons. "We came for a weekend and we never left," she said of arriving at the start of the pandemic. The couple's 4,500-square-foot home sits on 2 acres and was built in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The summer before purchasing in Falmouth, the couple rented in Yarmouth, where they searched for homes in neighboring communities. "We really fell in love with the Falmouth Foreside," Mrs. Malhotra said of the upscale waterfront neighborhood in Falmouth where she and her family ultimately settled. "I didn't want to live somewhere that felt really remote, coming from New Jersey, where everything is kind of at your fingertips." The Falmouth Foreside, she said, was just minutes away from downtown Portland, and some of the other communities they looked at didn't have as many options as Falmouth in general, like proximity to larger supermarkets, <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> and, notably, Portland's airport. She wanted "more hustle and bustle," she said, and ultimately only Falmouth fit the bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond proximity to the city, Falmouth has features that have drawn buyers specifically during the pandemic, said David Banks, broker/owner of The David Banks Team, Re/Max By The Bay. The town's three country clubs provide golf, indoor and outdoor pools, and restaurants for members. In addition, "it's instant access to the open ocean," Mr. Banks said. "You're a five-minute boat ride to the different islands." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Malhotra family and their dog, Jax, in their home's living room. PHOTO: Erin Little for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town's proximity to the ocean was what made Falmouth Ms. Kavanagh's "Someday I'll live here" neighborhood, she said. "We feel like we're living a very different life here than we were a couple of months ago in Boston because of the space and the ocean," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to see in Falmouth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mackworth Island</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This 100-acre island is accessible to Falmouth by causeway and includes walking trails, unobstructed views of Casco Bay, and bird watching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falmouth Nature Preserve</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A nature preserve with 10 acres of public land that can be used for hiking, fishing, cross-country skiing, biking, and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin's Point Bridge</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecting Falmouth with East Portland across the Presumpscot River, Martin's Point Bridge offers scenic walks and bike rides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Museums on the Green</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This museum is a collaborative group of historic homes and exhibits that is maintained by the Falmouth Historical Society. It includes the Cultural Center and the Dr. Francis Wicks House, a circa-1790 Federalist home that visitors can tour. The museums are currently closed to in-person visits due to the pandemic and the winter season, but virtual lectures and reference materials are available. The museums plan to reopen around Memorial Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maine State Ballet</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally, the ballet puts on about 40 performances a year at Falmouth's Lopez Theater, though they have been on hold since the pandemic started. The Ballet is, however, planning to reopen for performances later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dockside Grill</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A restaurant with a water view that focuses on modern New England fare, The Dockside Grill, which is closed until March due to Covid, is Falmouth's most upmarket option.</p>
