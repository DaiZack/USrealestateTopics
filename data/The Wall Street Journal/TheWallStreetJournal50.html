<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A barrage of sunny economic data poured in Wednesday, led by an upbeat regional report from the Federal Reserve's latest anecdotal survey of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve's survey of business activity found that economic conditions were improving across the country and appear to be "reasonably broadly based," with most areas noting growth in a number of industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eleven of the 12 regional Fed districts reported faster growth, except the Atlanta district, which said the pace of economic growth was "stable" in October and early November. "Labor markets across the nation generally improved or remained stable, with several districts noting a slowing in layoffs," the Fed said. Temporary workers are in increasing demand in the Boston, Minneapolis, Chicago and Richmond, Va., districts, the Fed said. But several districts reported that companies are waiting for sustained increases in orders before hiring permanent workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Wednesday, there were two upbeat reports on the U.S. manufacturing sector, which was the hardest-hit part of the economy during the 2001 recession. Orders for big-ticket items surged in October and a regional manufacturing index soared to a nine-year high in November. "The factory sector is on fire," said Stephen Stanley, senior market economist at RBS Greenwich Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed survey, prepared for use at the Dec. 9 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, also provided some positive news about the retail sector, reporting that spending was up on a year-over-year basis, with retailers "generally positive" about holiday sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report also suggested that the breakneck speed of spending that caused economic growth to surge during the summer months is easing. The Department of Commerce reported this week that gross domestic product, the value of the nation's output adjusted for inflation, grew at an annual rate of 8.2% in the July-to-September quarter. But that pace of growth is unlikely to be repeated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed survey found that auto sales, for example, were down in many regions, as auto makers cut back on generous factory incentives. The St. Louis district said incentives may have led many households to buy cars in the summer, rather than waiting until fall. One retailer in the Richmond district said sales patterns show consumers were living "paycheck to paycheck," now that the effects of this summer's tax refunds were lessening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economic data released Wednesday also indicated a moderation in consumer spending. The Commerce Department reported that while personal income rose 0.4% in October -- the biggest one-month gain since June -- personal consumption was unchanged last monsth after sinking 0.3% the month before. Spending on durable goods -- big-ticket items such as cars and appliances -- fell 2.3% last month, and spending on nondurable goods edged lower. But household spending on services rose 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most other economic news released Wednesday was upbeat:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago's business-activity index rose to 64.1 for November from 55 for the previous month. This was its seventh straight monthly gain and the highest level since October 1994. The Chicago survey is watched closely for clues to the index of the Institute for Supply Management, which will be released Monday. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, while a reading below 50 indicates a contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chicago report was well above market expectations and showed impressive gains in new orders and production. Its employment component retreated below 50, suggesting weaker conditions, but other job market data were more favorable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Durable-goods orders rose 3.3% to $184.5 billion last month, the biggest increase in 15 months, the Commerce Department said. Also, September orders were revised upward to show a 2.1% gain, first reported as a 1.1% increase. The gains outpaced forecasts of a 0.6% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- New home sales dropped 3.5% in October, according to the Commerce Department. But the pace of home sales stayed strong at a 1.1 million annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- The Labor Department said new claims for jobless benefits fell for the eighth straight week, reaching a 34-month low. Initial claims fell by 11,000 to 351,000 in the week ended Nov. 22, marking the lowest level since the week President Bush was inaugurated. Analysts said the drop supported evidence that the economy is finally starting to generate jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- U.S. consumer sentiment rose to its highest level since May 2002, according the University of Michigan's survey on consumer mood. The survey's index stood at 93.7 at the end of November, compared with 93.5 in the preliminary November estimate and 89.6 in October. "Households in general are feeling better about their economic lots in life because the employment situation is improving and the stock market is improving," said Paul Kasriel, director of economic research at Northern Trust Securities, Chicago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sunny U.S. economic data poured in Wednesday, led by manufacturing gains and job-market improvements, while the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest survey showed the American economy continued to steam ahead in October and early November.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for big-ticket items surged in October, and a regional-manufacturing index soared to a nine-year high. At the same time, new claims for unemployment benefits continued to fall in recent weeks, personal income rose, and consumer confidence improved.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 3.5% drop in new-home sales was the only news that was less than rosy. But the pace of home sales stayed strong at an annual rate of 1.105 million, according to the U.S. Commerce Department's report, and the decline was only a little bigger than the market expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These numbers are really quite strong," said Stephen Stanley, senior market economist at RBS Greenwich Capital. "The factory sector is on fire."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable-goods orders rose 3.3% to $184.5 billion (156.55 billion euros) last month, the biggest rise in 15 months, the U.S. Commerce Department said. September orders were revised upward to show a 2.1% gain, first reported as a 1.1% rise. The gain outpaced forecasts of a 0.6% rise, and orders climbed in almost all categories except autos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago's business-activity index rose to 64.1 in November from 55 the previous month. This was its seventh-straight monthly gain and the highest level since October 1994.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the drop supported evidence that the economy is starting to generate jobs after a long dry spell. "That's a very nice decline. It suggests some of the unemployed are starting to make their way back to the work force," said economist Mickey Levy of Banc of America Securities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the U.S. Fed said in its latest beige-book report that the labor market showed signs of stabilizing. "Labor markets across the nation generally improved or remained stable, with several districts noting a slowing in layoffs," the Fed said. The Boston, Minneapolis, Chicago and Richmond, Virginia, districts noted greater demand for temporary workers. Firms are waiting for sustained increases in orders before hiring permanent workers, several districts said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Reports received from the district banks suggest that the economy continued to expand in October and early November," the Fed said. Economic improvements in the 12 districts appear to be "reasonably broadly based," with most noting growth in a number of industries, it said.

</div><div class="author">By Jon E. Hilsenrath </div><div>1476 words</div><div>26 November 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic recovery has picked up momentum, boosting the bottom lines of a wide range of U.S. corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that profits at American companies rose 30% in the third quarter, compared with a year earlier. That was the largest year-over-year growth in profits in 19 years and was enough to lift the annual pace of profits above $1 trillion for the first time in history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The corporate profit figures were part of a broader report on economic output, or gross domestic product. The government revised up its estimate of the annual rate of third-quarter GDP to 8.2% from the previously reported annual pace of 7.2%. The revision in GDP -- the total value of the nation's output of goods and services -- occurred largely because companies didn't reduce inventories as aggressively as previously thought in the face of booming consumer demand. Less inventory reduction meant companies had to produce more goods to keep up with demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many companies, the combination of faster economic growth (which spurs revenue gains) and rapid productivity improvement (which helps contain costs) translates to stronger profits. Better profits, in turn, are expected to give business executives added confidence to hire more workers and invest more aggressively in new projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is making us more confident that this [recovery] is sustainable," said James Glassman, an economist with J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co. "Hiring is already under way and my guess is it is going to accelerate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underscoring that point, the Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence rose to 91.7 in November from 81.7 in October, as fewer of the 5,000 people contacted in the group's monthly mail survey said jobs were hard to get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, in the revision of its GDP estimate, the Commerce Department said business investment in equipment and software grew at an 18% annual rate during the third quarter, faster than the 15% capital-spending rate originally estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers are a positive development for President Bush's re-election drive. By mid-morning, Bush campaign strategist Matthew Dowd had compiled a graph comparing consumer-confidence trends during the Bush administration with parallel periods in the Nixon, Reagan and first Bush presidencies. "We're about where Reagan and Nixon were," he said, referring to two Republicans who won re-election in landslides. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll found that, for the first time this year, more voters approved of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy than disapproved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats, in turn, are concentrating on Mr. Bush's potential economic soft spots, citing such issues as aid to minority businesses, improving public schools and shortcomings in early childhood education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market, which had anticipated the strong economic news, managed only modest gains yesterday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few economists, however, believe the current level of economic activity is sustainable. Indeed, the latest survey of economic forecasters by WSJ.com calls for GDP to grow at a rate of about 4% in the October-December period. Why? Last summer's boom in mortgage refinancing to take advantage of low interest rates and President Bush's tax cuts and child-tax credits will fade in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many economists expect the economy to cool from its red-hot pace, the chances of the recovery fizzling, as it did in 2002, seem to be diminishing. "I'm going to hire some people because I think [a recovery] is here now," said Bill Zadrozny, chief executive of the North American arm of Siemens Financial Services, the financing unit of Siemens AG of Germany. The company, which finances capital-equipment purchases for Siemens' customers and other companies, is expecting its North American asset base to grow to $3.6 billion in the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, from $3.2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government estimated that corporate profits rose to an annual rate of $1.003 trillion in the third quarter from $771 billion in the third quarter of 2002 and $897 billion in the second quarter of 2003, on a seasonally adjusted basis. The report was the first peek at economywide profits for the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's initial estimate of gross domestic product, which was made last month, included estimates of overall economic activity, but not profits. Those figures are the government's broadest measure of profits for the whole U.S. economy and include listed and nonlisted companies. It makes adjustments for changes in the value of inventories and for depreciation and changes in the value of capital equipment. While some other measures of profitability have been skewed by changes in the tax law enacted earlier this year, Kenneth Petrick, a Commerce Department statistician, said this broad measure isn't affected and offers the best picture of profit trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other measures of corporate profitability have turned decisively higher during the past six months. Among 1,489 companies tracked by Dow Jones &amp;Co. in the US Total Market Index, net income rose 70% in the third quarter from a year earlier, to $133 billion. The figures are those actually reported by listed companies under generally accepted accounting principles, without the many special adjustments that Wall Street analysts often make to the numbers. The figures also aren't recorded at an annual rate, as are the Commerce Department figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy and financial companies were big winners in the third quarter. Exxon Mobil Corp., for instance, said its net income increased 38% to $3.65 billion, thanks to higher oil and natural-gas prices. Chevron Texaco Corp. swung to a profit of $1.975 billion from a loss of $904 million. Meanwhile, JP Morgan Chase &amp;Co. said profit rose to $1.63 billion from $40 million, due to a significant reduction in bad loans to the corporate sector. Citigroup Inc. said profit rose 20% to $4.69 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sectors, such as steel, tobacco and pharmaceuticals deteriorated, but overall, the gains were broad-based. Among 87 industries tracked by Dow Jones, 66 saw profits improving. Of the 235 technology companies such as Dell Inc. and Intel Corp. included in the total, the bottom line swung to a collective profit of $8.9 billion from a collective loss of $7 billion. Included among them was a gain for Internet service companies, such as Yahoo Inc. Soft-drink makers, including Coca Cola Co. and Pepsico Inc., saw a 14% increase in reported net income. Industrial companies -- ranging from 3M Co. to Deere &amp;Co. to Solectron Corp. -- collectively saw a 70% improvement after a miserable 2002. Cyclical consumer companies -- from General Motors Corp. to Northwest Airlines to RadioShack Corp. -- altogether reported an 87% improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No matter how you slice it, this was a terrific quarter," said Chuck Hill, director of research at Boston-based Thomson First Call, which tracks corporate earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Profits are expected to remain strong at least through the end of the year. Mr. Hill projects fourth-quarter profits for companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 index to be up 25% from a year earlier, after a 22% increase in the third quarter. That number is after so-called extraordinary items, such as one-time restructuring charges, are stripped out. During the first half of next year, such S&amp;P 500 operating profits are expected to grow by 12% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other factors might slow the pace of overall economic growth in the months ahead. First, because companies didn't reduce inventories as much as previously thought during the third quarter, there is a chance they won't be as aggressive as some economists expect them to be in building up new inventories in the fourth quarter. Second, it is possible that imports could surge again, after growing at a relatively slow pace of 1.5% in the third quarter. Increasing imports detract from domestic output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes softened for the first time in five months in October but remained at elevated levels. Sales fell 4.9% from the previous month's record sales pace, to an annual rate of 6.35 million units.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery in U.S. corporate profits has entered a whole new phase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department reported Tuesday that corporate profits rose 30% during the third quarter from a year earlier, the largest year-to-year change in 19 years, and exceeded an annual rate of $1 trillion for the first time in history.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the government raised its estimate of the growth rate of third-quarter economic activity to 8.2% from the previously reported annual pace of 7.2%, largely because companies didn't reduce inventories as aggressive as previously thought in the face of booming consumer demand. Less inventory reduction meant more actual output of goods.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many American companies, the combination of faster economic growth, which spurs revenue gains, and rapid productivity improvements, which helps to contain costs, is helping to boost the bottom line. Better profits, in turn, are expected to give business executives added confidence to hire more workers and invest more aggressively in new projects.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is making us more confident that this [recovery] is sustainable," said James Glassman, an economist with J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. "Hiring is already under way and my guess is it is going to accelerate."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government estimated corporate profits rose to an annual rate of $1.003 trillion during the third quarter from $771 billion in the third quarter of 2002 and $897 billion in the second quarter of 2003, on a seasonally adjusted basis. These figures are the government's broadest measure of profits for the whole U.S. economy and include listed and nonlisted companies. It makes adjustments for changes in the value of inventories and for depreciation and changes in the value of capital equipment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market responded moderately Tuesday after an anticipatory rally a day earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was ahead 11 points at 9758 by late morning. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up five points at 1952.24, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index edged up 2.21 points to 1054.29.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other measures of corporate profitability have turned decisively higher during the past six months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among 1,489 companies tracked by Dow Jones &amp; Co. in the US Total Market Index, net income rose 70% for the third quarter from a year earlier, to $133 billion. The figures are those actually reported by listed companies under generally accepted accounting principles, without the many special adjustments that Wall Street analysts often make to the numbers. The figures also aren't recorded at an annual rate, as are the Commerce Department figures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helping to make comparisons with a year ago more favorable, the latest reported results included fewer charges and asset write-offs than last year, when many companies were cleaning their books because of restructuring efforts, new accounting rules and bookkeeping scandals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy and finance companies were big winners in the third quarter. Exxon Mobil Corp. said its net income increased 38% to $3.65 billion, thanks to higher oil and natural-gas prices. Chevron Texeco Corp. went to $1.96 billion in profit from a loss of $904 million. Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan Chase said profit rose to $1.63 billion from $40 million, due to a significant reduction in bad loans to the corporate sector. Citigroup Inc. said profit rose 20% to $4.69 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the gains weren't limited to these two sectors. Among 87 industries tracked by Dow Jones, 66 saw profits improving. Among 235 technology companies included in the total, the bottom line swung to collective profit of $8.9 billion from a collective loss of $7 billion. Included among them was a gain for Internet-service providers. Soft-drink makers saw a 14% increase in reported net income, industrial companies saw a 70% improvement, and consumer companies reported an 87% improvement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No matter how you slice it, this was a terrific quarter," said Chuck Hill, director of research at Boston-based Thomson First Call, which tracks corporate earnings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question now is whether it is sustainable. Because companies didn't reduce inventories as much as thought during the third quarter, there is a chance they won't be as aggressive as some economists expect them to be in building up new inventories during the fourth quarter. That could hold back the nation's overall growth rate. But few economists are rushing to make large downward revisions to their estimates of fourth-quarter growth. The latest survey of economic forecasters by WSJ.com shows the economy is expected to grow at a 4% rate in the October-December period.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Profits, meanwhile, are expected to remain strong at least through the end of the year. Mr. Hill notes that Wall Street analysts expect fourth-quarter profits for companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 index to be reported up 22% from a year earlier, after a 21% increase for the third quarter. That number is after so-called extraordinary items are stripped out, such as one-time restructuring charges. During the first half of next year, such S&amp;P 500 operating profits are expected to grow 12% from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hill says he has added confidence in the most recent numbers, because fewer companies have been issuing downward profit warnings before their releases. So far for the fourth quarter, 13 companies have issued negative warnings for every ten that have issued positive warnings. That compares with a 17-to-10 ratio of negative-to-positive announcements last year at this time, and a 43-to-10 ratio when profits were collapsing in 2001. "That says that the numbers are likely to hold up," Mr. Hill said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the long run, broad, economywide profits generally keep pace with the rate of overall economic growth, which economists say is expected to be 5% to 6% in the years to come.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Conference Board reported that its November reading on consumer confidence surged to 91.7 from 81.7 in October, trouncing expectations of 85. The increase in the expectations index surged to a 17-month high of 99.4. The present-situation index leapt to a 14-month high of 80.1 from 67. That part of the index usually tracks the job market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, existing-home sales decreased by 4.9% to an annual rate of 6.35 million in October, a somewhat larger decline than expected but still a healthy rate.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Jon E. Hilsenrath </div><div>624 words</div><div>20 November 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hammer time in housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defying expectations of a slowdown, home builders quickened the pace of new construction in October. Housing starts rose 2.9% from the month before to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.96 million units, the highest rate of activity since January 1986, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase was driven by construction of stand-alone homes. Single-family starts rose 5.7%, setting a record at a 1.62 million annual rate. Multifamily starts, or starts on apartment buildings and condominiums, dropped 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction increase provides some assurance overall economic activity won't fizzle in the fourth quarter after a booming third quarter. While household spending on vehicles and other consumer products has shown signs of slowing in recent weeks, housing construction demonstrated little letup. The Commerce Department also revised up its estimates of housing starts in September and August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the fourth quarter we expected that housing would not be adding to growth in [economic output], but now it looks like it almost certainly will," said Michael Carliner, economist with the National Association of Home Builders. The association released a survey Tuesday that showed confidence among builders fell slightly in November after reaching its highest point in four years in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government estimates the overall economy grew at a 7.2% annual rate during the third quarter, though that number is expected to be revised up when it is updated Tuesday. Economists are projecting a 4% annualized rate of growth in the fourth quarter. Home building accounts for a little more than 4% of all economic output, or gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists doubt the recent rate of new-home construction is sustainable, and some believe the housing market could be at the center of the next financial bubble for the nation. Yet the latest report suggested home construction should continue to rise at least for the next few months. The October report showed that building permits, an indicator of future building activity, rose 5.2% to a 1.97 million annual rate. "Financing rates remain quite low from a longer-run perspective. And an expected pickup in income growth should provide an offset to help keep housing affordability near its record highs. Also, inventories of unsold homes remain quite depressed," David Greenlaw, an economist with Morgan Stanley, said in a report to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts across the nation were mixed. New activity rose 17.7% in the West. Steven Berman, a Commerce Department statistician, said there was no evidence wildfires in California during the month had a significant impact on the data. Typically, it takes many months before disasters such as wildfires or hurricanes lead to new building activity. Starts fell in the Northeast by 18%. They declined in the Midwest by 8% while increasing in the fast-growing South by 4.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association said its index measuring applications for mortgages to purchase new homes increased 13.5% in the week ended Nov. 14 from the previous week to 425.9. That was up 23% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association said mortgage borrowers increasingly favor adjustable-rate mortgages over fixed-rate mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages have financing rates that can be changed based on movements in shorter-term interest rates. They now carry lower interest costs than fixed-rate mortgages, which are fixed over long periods of time. In mid-November, adjustable-rate mortgages accounted for 27.5% of mortgage applications, the highest share in more than three years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also revised upward its estimates of housing starts in August and September, which could mean upward revisions to third-quarter growth when the department updates its estimate of gross domestic product in the July-to-September period Tuesday. The government currently estimates the economy grew at a 7.2% annual rate during the third quarter. Economists are projecting 4% growth in the fourth quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many doubt the recent rate of new-home construction is sustainable, and some economists believe the housing market is the next financial bubble in the U.S. Yet the latest report suggested home construction could continue to rise at least for the next few months. The October report showed that building permits, an indicator of future building activity, jumped 5.2% in the month to a 1.97 million annual rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government report showed that single-family starts rose 5.7%, setting a record at a 1.62 million annual rate. Multifamily starts, or starts on apartment buildings, dropped 3%.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1496 words</div><div>6 November 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGHER MORTGAGE rates don't just take the fun out of refinancing. They could also reduce home prices in some parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As interest rates rise from the summer's lows, that is one of the bigger risks in the economy for Americans whose best-performing asset over the past few years has been their home. But it would be a mixed blessing for buyers already priced out of many markets. They might pay less for the house but would face higher borrowing costs. A 25-city analysis by Fidelity National Financial Inc., a real-estate services provider, shows that rising rates will have a sharply different impact on various regions of the country. The study, conducted at the request of The Wall Street Journal, found that many of the markets that have seen the sharpest appreciation now stand to be the hardest hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, a median-priced home in Boston, currently worth $407,000, would see its price tumble by $59,000 by 2006, if the rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage climbed nearly two percentage points to 8% next year and stayed there, according to the Fidelity National study. Other vulnerable markets include several California cities, Seattle and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fidelity's analysis suggests that rising rates will cause the most pain in markets on the East and West coasts where it's hard to build new homes to meet rising demand. "Because people know there's a limited supply of homes for sale . . . you get almost a frenzy," says Fidelity chief valuation officer Michael Sklarz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates would have a much more muted effect in less frothy markets like Pittsburgh, where the median home sells for just $108,000. If the rate on a 30-year mortgage rose to 8%, that home would still rise by $6,000 in price. The Fidelity analysis looked at how rising rates would affect home prices in the 25 largest metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates play a far more important role in housing than in any other consumer market. Because homes cost so much and because they're financed over such a long period of time, even small changes in rates can have a big effect on prices that buyers are willing -- or able -- to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While rates remain low by historical standards, they already have risen significantly since this summer. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages now average 6.08%, after bottoming out at 5.31% in mid-June, according to HSH Associates, a financial publishers in Butler, N.J. The Mortgage Bankers Association expects rates to reach 7% in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher mortgage rates would impact the housing boom in a variety of ways. Higher rates make it harder for borrowers to qualify for a loan and reduce the size of the loan they can obtain. A borrower earning $50,000 could purchase a $195,000 home at 6% mortgage rates. But using the same lending standards, that borrower could only afford a $159,000 house if rates climbed to 8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates also mean bigger monthly payments. On a $350,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the monthly payment climbs by $470 to $2,568 when rates are at 8% instead of 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the impact of rising rates has been limited. Sales of existing homes surged in September, setting their third consecutive monthly record, according to the National Association of Realtors. Median home prices climbed 9.1% in September over a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, if mortgage rates do climb to 7%, that's "high enough that it make a big difference in people's thinking," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com in West Chester, Pa. The housing market is particularly vulnerable to rising rates, he adds, because so many people took advantage of low rates and bought homes earlier than they would have otherwise. Home-ownership climbed to record levels in the second quarter, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal banking regulators are already keeping a close eye on the potential risks. In a paper delivered to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Board of Directors on Tuesday, FDIC economists warned that, "Home prices in less-affordable housing markets could be particularly vulnerable [to rising rates], since median family incomes are already straining to finance median priced homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everybody agrees with this warning. The same areas of the country that have high prices also have housing shortages, notes Lawrence Yun, a senior economist with National Association of Realtors. As a result, he predicts these regions won't be hurt more than other areas of the country by rising rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other factors could blunt the damage, as well. A briskly growing economy could put more money in workers' wallets, providing a cushion against rising rates. In addition, as prices rise, more buyers are also likely to opt for adjustable-rate mortgages, which are tied to short-term rates that haven't yet moved upward. Adjustable-rate mortgages now account for 25.4% of mortgage loans, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, up from 14.4% in mid-June. "It's a dandy shock absorber," says David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are some signs the housing market could be cooling off. Housing affordability fell in the third quarter to its lowest level in a year, according to the National Association of Realtors. The Federal Reserve Board reported this week that demand for loans to purchase homes fell in the third quarter, the first drop in two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price growth has also been slowing. Home prices increased at an annualized rate of 3.13% in the second quarter, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulates government-sponsored mortgage companies. That compares with an 8.77% rate in the year-earlier period, and is the lowest rate of increase since the fall of 1996.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For overheated markets, a slowdown in price appreciation would be a welcome breather. In some parts of the country, the buying frenzy has pushed prices out of line with local incomes. In California's Orange County, for instance, less than one in five households can now afford the median price house, according to the California Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when rates rise, home prices in such markets are likely to sink for several years or move sideways before they recover, according to Fidelity's analysis. In Orange County, for instance, 8% mortgage rates would push prices down 10% by 2006, according to the Fidelity study. In the center of the country, where prices never got so rich, rising rates are more likely to simply slow the rate price appreciation, not stop it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coastal markets also tend to be more sensitive to rising rates because the homes cost so much. In Los Angeles, where the median home price is $315,000, the monthly payment on a 30-year mortgage jumps by $423 if rates rise to 8% from 6%. In St. Louis, where the typical home goes for $117,000, that rise in rates would boost the monthly mortgage payment by just $157.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jon E. Hilsenrath  </div><div>597 words</div><div>4 November 2003</div><div>The Asian Wall Street Journal</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2003 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy maintained some momentum through October, after recording a blistering growth rate during the summer months, according to a report on the manufacturing sector.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a private research group, said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 57.0 in October, higher than forecasters predicted, from 53.7 in September and 54.7 in August. Readings above 50 point to expansion in manufacturing activity, while those below 50 indicate contraction. It was the fourth-straight month during which the index was above that important level of 50.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing report was marked by indications of sharply rising new orders for manufactured goods, rising production and rising exports. In addition, it pointed to a slower pace of job cuts and inventory reductions. However, Norbert Ore, chair of the institute's business-survey committee, cautioned that the gains weren't very broad; of the 20 manufacturing industries represented in the survey, only 14 were growing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report is important because it provides one of the first glimpses into the economy's performance in the fourth quarter, which runs from October through December. Most economists believe the rate of economic expansion will inevitably slow in the fourth quarter, after U.S. gross domestic product grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.2% in the period between July and September. Most notably, consumer spending is expected to slow down, after being stimulated during the summer by tax cuts and a mortgage-refinancing boom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing report suggests that even though consumer spending might be slowing to a more sustainable rate, many manufacturers are still playing some catch up with the last spending surge. This could in turn provide the economy with continuing momentum. At 57.0, the ISM index was at its highest level since January 2000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the best report that we have seen in quite some time in terms of the overall strength of manufacturing. The picture continues to improve, and it appears that manufacturing will finish 2003 on a very positive note, assuming the recent trend continues," said Mr. Ore.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM said its new-orders index rose, for a sixth-straight month, to 64.3 October, from 60.4 in September. It was the highest level since June 1994, and indicated that many manufacturers now have orders in hand that could feed future production. Meanwhile, an index for export orders rose to 59.6 in October, from 52.9 the month before. It was the highest level since Sept. 1994 and a possible indication that the U.S. is benefiting from a global economic recovery.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's employment index indicated factory payrolls shrank for the month, but at a reduced pace compared with the month before. October's reading stood at 47.7, compared with 45.7 in September. Manufacturers also slowed their reductions of inventories. The inventories index rose to 44.5 from 42.7 in September. Twenty-seven percent of those surveyed said their customers' inventories were too low, while only 5% said customer inventories were too high.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that construction spending climbed 1.3% in September, fueled by another strong month of home building. Total construction spending came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $910.6 billion, the department said. In dollar terms, this was the highest level on record.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing activity accelerated in October, an indication the economy entered the fourth quarter with positive momentum, even though consumer spending, an important growth engine, seems to be slowing from the summer's blistering pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a private research group, said yesterday that its index of manufacturing business conditions rose to a higher-than-expected 57.0 in October from 53.7 in September. Readings above 50 point to expansion in manufacturing activity, while those below indicate contraction. It was the fourth straight month during which the index was above 50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 57, the ISM index was at its highest level since January 2000. Stocks rallied on the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 57.34 points, or 0.59%, to 9858.46, a 17-month high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It appears that manufacturing will finish 2003 on a very positive note," said Norbert Ore, chairman of the institute's survey committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report provided an early glimpse into the economy's performance at the start of the fourth quarter. Most economists believe the rate of economic expansion will slow in the current quarter, after the nation's gross domestic product grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.2% between July and September. Most notably, consumer spending is expected to slow, after being stimulated this summer by tax cuts and mortgage refinancing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing report suggests that even though consumer spending might slow, many manufacturers are still playing some catch-up with the last spending surge. "Growth over the past two quarters greatly exceeded business expectations," said Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City Bank in Cleveland. Because many manufacturers depleted inventories in the process, he said, they are now forced to ramp up production to meet new orders. That could provide the economy with continuing momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's new orders index rose for a sixth straight month to 64.3 October, the highest level since June 1994. An index for export orders rose to 59.6 in October, from 52.9 the month before. It was the highest level since September 1994 and a possible indication that the U.S. is benefiting from a global economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's employment index indicated factory payrolls shrank for the month but at a reduced pace compared with the month before.

Twenty-seven percent of those surveyed said their customers' inventories were too low, while only 5% said customer inventories were too high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the gains weren't broad-based. According to Mr. Ore, six of the manufacturing industries represented didn't grow last month; 14 were growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone is optimistic. A survey of 912 economic development officials released by the International Economic Development Council showed that many local officials were unhappy with the Bush administration's efforts to boost the economy, despite the latest growth surge. Eighty percent of those surveyed said tax cuts had little impact or even a negative impact on weak local job markets. This group called for more federal resources to be directed at initiatives for work-force retraining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department reported construction spending climbed 1.3% in September, fueled by home building. Total construction spending rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $910.6 billion, the highest level on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Federal Reserve said standards for bank lending were largely stable in recent months, while business and credit-card loans became less expensive.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip </div><div>587 words</div><div>28 October 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home buying remained exceptionally robust last month, defying expectations that higher mortgage rates would clip sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes jumped 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.69 million in September, a new monthly record, from August, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing markets are red hot," association chief economist David Lereah said in a statement. "This underscores the powerful fundamentals that aredriving the housing market -- household growth, low interest rates and an improving economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said new-home sales slipped 0.2% in September to a still-high annual rate of 1.145 million, from August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty-year mortgage rates, which dropped to about 5.25% in June, jumped a full percentage point by August, leading many analysts to predict declining affordability soon would pinch home sales. So far, that hasn't happened, in part because some home buyers rushed to close on their purchases to beat additional increases in rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mortgage-applications data clearly suggest home sales can't continue to run at this pace, and we expect a clear decline by year end," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, a research service in Valhalla, N.Y. "But for now, housing remains the hottest single sector of a rapidly-warming economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the recent rise, mortgage rates are still low by historic standards, in part because the Federal Reserve has expressed a willingness to keep rates down until the economy has used up enough of its idle resources to ensure inflation doesn't fall further. This message has convinced investors that the Fed's target short-term interest-rate, now at 1%, won't head up until well into next year. That has made investors more willing to accept lower returns on long-term bonds, which drive mortgage rates. Mortgage rates edged down from their August highs to about 6% in recent weeks. The Fed is expected to keep its interest-rate target at 1% when it meets today and repeat, as it did in August and September, that its principal concern is that inflation may fall too low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR President Cathy Whatley said existing-home sales are expected to set a full-year record of 5.9 million this year.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The robust single-family-housing market in the U.S. should help to keep total construction activity in the U.S. from falling in 2003, as home building offsets declines in construction of everything from office buildings and schools to power plants, according to a new report.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total construction activity in the U.S. is expected to grow 1% in 2003 from a year earlier, according to McGraw-Hill Construction, a division of McGraw-Hill Cos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Single-family housing has been growing at a blistering pace over the past two years, providing an upward push in construction for 2003," said Robert Murray, chief economist at McGraw-Hill Construction. Mr. Murray was expected to have delivered his annual forecast to construction-industry leaders at a conference Thursday in Washington hosted by McGraw-Hill Construction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total value of construction starts is expected to be $505.6 billion in 2003, up from $501.7 billion in 2002. This year would be the second in a row of 1% growth and more or less reflects the state of the U.S. economy. Construction activity grew at an average of 10% annually from 1996 to 1999.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When the economy is doing better, construction [activity] does great; when the economy's not doing good, it doesn't do well," said Rajeev Dhawan, director of the economic-forecasting center at the Robinson College of Business at Georgia State University in Atlanta. "That would be true for residential construction if we didn't have low interest rates."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McGraw-Hill Construction expects the total value of construction starts to rise about 1% in 2004, to $508.9 billion, but this time largely on the strength of an expected uptick in construction of commercial real estate, particularly hotels and stores, while housing declines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of single-family-home construction is expected to fall 2% in 2004, after an 8% rise in 2003, as the economy continues to improve, prompting interest and mortgage rates to rise, says the report.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family-housing construction starts are expected to drop 5% in 2004 to 1.29 million units from an expected 1.36 million units in 2003. In dollar terms, construction would fall to $226 billion in 2004 from an expected $230.5 billion in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of commercial properties is expected to climb 9% in dollar volume and 5% in square footage in 2004, after remaining flat in both categories in 2003. McGraw-Hill Construction said hotels and warehouses should see double-digit growth, while the upturn for offices should be more modest, since any hiring that occurs next year is expected to be gradual.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some in the industry are more circumspect about construction of commercial real estate. "The only category I'm optimistic about for the near term is retail construction," said Kenneth D.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Demand for new homes in the U.S., fueled by continued low interest rates, is likely to remain strong throughout the year.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders in the U.S. pulled back a bit in August, but construction remained robust, an indication that rising mortgage rates haven't yet taken a big bite out of the housing sector.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have been watching housing data closely in recent weeks to determine if the recent rate rise would undermine housing demand. The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the U.S. of about 6.2% is one percentage point higher than the same rate three months ago, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department said housing starts fell 3.8% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.82 million units. The decline echoed a modest drop in a monthly index of builder confidence released Tuesday by the National Association of Home Builders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But permits for new homes rose 4.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.89 million units, the highest level since last December. Permits for single-family homes rose 2.9% to a record 1.48 million units. In addition, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said its weekly index of applications for mortgages to buy homes rose 5.8% in the week ended Sept. 12 to 432.4. The purchase-loan application index never rose higher than 414 in 2002, a record year for home sales.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders pulled back a bit in August, but construction remained robust, an indication that rising interest rates haven't yet taken a big bite out of the nation's housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have been watching housing data closely in recent weeks to see if a recent rise in mortgage rates will undermine housing demand by driving the monthly cost of homeownership higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the housing data, while in some cases slightly weaker, appear to be holding up. The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 3.8% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.82 million units. This decline echoed a modest drop in a monthly index of builder confidence released Tuesday by the National Association of Home Builders. But July's housing starts were revised higher, to a 1.89 million-unit rate, the highest since April 1986, and other indicators suggest strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits for new homes, viewed as a good indicator of future construction activity, rose 4.8% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.89 million units, the highest level since last December. Also, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said its weekly index of applications for mortgages to buy homes rose 5.8% in the week ended Sept. 12 to 432.4, a level that is unusually high by historical standards. The index never topped 414 in 2002, a record year for home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists believe the housing market will remain healthy in the short run, in part because of demand from buyers who are rushing to buy now because of fears that interest rates could go even higher. What happens later in the year, however, is the subject of vigorous debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence continues to mount that the broader economy is on the mend. In one small but telling sign, heavy-equipment and engine maker Caterpillar Inc. said world-wide machine sales by dealers rose 8% from last year during the three months ended in August, compared with a 6% gain during the three months ended in July. The company said sales in North America rose 5% during the August period compared with 2% during the three months ended in July.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said its weekly index of applications for mortgages to buy homes rose 5.8% in the week ended Sept. 12 to 432.4, an extraordinarily high level. The purchase-loan application index never rose higher than 414 in 2002, a record year for home sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists believe the U.S. housing market will remain healthy in the short run, in part because of a boost in demand from buyers who were holding out for lower interest rates, and now are rushing to buy because of fears that interest rates could go higher. What happens after that demand wears off remains unclear, and some economists believe the market will slow more noticeably if rates continue to creep higher.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Once this pipeline of fence-sitters is out of the way, we will see a more significant decline" in housing, predicts Ian Morris, the chief U.S. economist at HSBC Securities. Mr. Morris is one of a handful of prominent economists who raised concerns over the past year that U.S. home prices may have risen too high, too fast in some markets, especially on the West and East coasts, setting those areas up for a possible decline in prices, if demand weakens.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Shapiro, the chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc., was more optimistic. "You've got economic fundamentals that are improving somewhat, which tends to make people feel better about making a commitment" like buying a home, he says. That increased confidence could help offset the negative impacts of rising interest rates, he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing in the U.S. has already cooled in one critical respect: Home-price appreciation has slowed noticeably over the past year. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, a regulatory body that oversees mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, recently said home prices rose just 0.78% during the second quarter of 2003, the slowest three-month rate of appreciation since 1996.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The Home Front: Trouble at the Top --- In a Surprise for Luxury Sellers, Prices are Down, Not Up; Near Denver, a 35% Decline</span>
</div><div class="author">By Danielle Reed </div><div>1893 words</div><div>12 September 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>W1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR BOB LODIE, the news was tough to swallow. Living in real-estate rich Westport, Conn., he figured his $1.7 million home, with six bedrooms and a sweeping veranda, was a safe investment. But when he was forced to sell it last year, not only did he not make a profit -- he wound up taking a $150,000 loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I couldn't believe I took the hit," says the motivational speaker. "It was disappointing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're wondering how home values are holding up, there may be some bad news on the horizon. According to a survey commissioned by Weekend Journal, luxury-home prices through the first half of 2003 are down in almost half of 50 major counties we looked at, including even the blue-chip suburbs of the Midwest and Connecticut's gold coast. At the economy's top, three years ago, that figure was only 8%. And with people buzzing about the recent rise in interest rates, some brokers are beginning to use the "D" word (that's decline) for the first time in years. "We peaked in 2001," says Jim Bodin, an agent who handles luxury homes for Coldwell Banker in Colorado.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy homeowners who bought before the real-estate boom, of course, still stand to make a profit. But brokers say signs of a luxury slump keep cropping up, with one Chicago agent saying his area suddenly has 200 big places for sale. New York's Hamptons is seeing a remarkable surplus of super-priced homes, too (more than a dozen are asking $20 million or more). Why the pileups? "No one has to buy a luxury home," says David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, of course, home prices continue to buck the economy, rising 5.56% over the 12 months ending in June according to the federal government. Indeed, our survey found only two markets in which overall prices had dropped (sorry, Boulder, Colo.). But when it comes to luxury homes -- defined in our survey as those over 4,000 square feet -- prices have been on the downswing for a while, falling last year in almost a third of our markets, according to Fidelity National Information Solutions, which did the survey. For now, analysts say it's too early to tell how much the slowdown will trickle down the market, if at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it comes as a bit of a jolt to people like Robin Brown, who paid $12 million for her 1852 townhouse in New York three years ago. Now she's got it on the market again -- for about $4 million less. "Wall Street went down," says Ms. Brown, who owns an upscale health club. "That's when it hits the high end." Among the other folks now facing a loss: everyone from Enron ex-Chairman Kenneth Lay (out $620,000 on the recent sale of a four-bedroom riverview home in Aspen) to Scott Rudin, producer of films like "The Hours." He paid $4.5 million for The Rocks, his 8,000-square foot Washington, Conn., place -- and just settled for $1.2 million less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, reports of real estate's impending fall have been heard repeatedly lately -- from the post-Sept. 11 dip to the "bubble" debate last winter. And the recent uptick in interest rates has many experts predicting a slowdown this year, with higher rates driving down what people will spend. That could affect buyer confidence especially on the high end, say analysts, as folks start doubting whether they'll be able to trade up. "If those expectations change, you're going to have fewer motivated buyers," says David Dale-Johnson, of the University of Southern California's Lusk Center for Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For our survey, FNIS compiled data from more than 15,000 publicly recorded upper-end sales in the past two years. To get more geographic spread, they defined luxury homes by size, rather than just price, using a minimum 4,000 square feet, or about double the median American home. Then they compared median prices so far this year (in most places with sales through the end of the second quarter), with the same time period in 2002 and 2001. For context they also looked at the overall market in each spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, what's going on in some key spots around the country, from East to West:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fairfield County, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NUMBERS: Luxury market, -9.71%; luxury median, $1,465,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCENE: Two words -- Wall Street</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOUGHEST SELL: Darien trophy homes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, these upscale Connecticut suburbs were among the hottest markets in the country, with high-end prices growing by almost 20% a year. But those days are gone -- along with the big Wall Street bonuses that fueled them. Indeed, while the $1.465 million median luxury price here is among the highest in the country, that's still down almost 10% from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local agents say high-end sellers are getting increasingly willing to deal, too. Indeed, in pricey Darien, where 10 houses are on the market for $5 million or more, seven have been "marked down substantially," says agent Doug Werner -- including a place with its own pipe organ called the Villa des Arts, now available for $5.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Palm Beach County, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NUMBERS: Luxury market, -6.83%; luxury median, $810,600</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCENE: Weakness in lower ends of luxury market, but mega-rich aren't abandoning Worth Avenue yet</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOUGHEST SELL: "Starter" homes in the $1 million to $3 million range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its mega-mansions and pricey enclaves like Jupiter Island, Palm Beach has always been pretty insulated from the vagaries of the real-estate market. Interest rates don't really affect buyers at this level and the low taxes have helped keep sales here healthy -- as they still are in the $6 million-plus market say local agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why are luxury prices down now? The growing supply of $1 million to $3 million homes, including condominiums and places built in the '50s, whose prices got a big run-up in the past decade (a three-bedroom on a lot not too much bigger than two tennis courts for $1.595 million?). Indeed, according to local listings, there are almost 90 houses in that price range currently available -- up by about a third from 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financier Wilbur Ross paid a bit more for his place -- about $9 million, though that was still 20% less than the asking price. So is he worried about his investment? Not exactly. "I wouldn't have bought if I thought it was going to have a precipitous decline," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cuyahoga County, Ohio</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NUMBERS: Luxury market, -9.17%; luxury median, $545,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCENE: Big homes aren't budging but there's bargain hunting in Shaker Heights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOUGHEST SELL: "Move-up" homes in west-side suburbs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We expected a big drop in prices in dot-com meltdown spots like northern California, but Cleveland? Experts say home prices here got ahead of themselves in the '90s -- the median price of a high-end home rose to more than $600,000 from $450,000 during the boom -- making many would-be buyers skittish. Indeed, this county, which includes the city plus upscale suburbs like Shaker Heights and Rocky River, was one of the bigger losers in our survey. (Still moving briskly: Shaker Heights homes under $500,000 -- when they come on the market.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Hebert figures he was lucky to sell his Rocky River home recently -- since local agents say move-up properties like his aren't drawing many bidders. But he still had to knock $30,000 off his $675,000 asking price. "I have neighbors who've been trying to sell their homes for two years," says the media executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cook County, Ill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NUMBERS: Luxury market -3.85%; luxury median, $800,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCENE: Leading the slowdown -- and some buyers still sitting out</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOUGHEST SELL: Turn-of-the-century homes needing big renovations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big surprise here: The high-end market in Chicago and its Lake Michigan suburbs actually peaked back in the second quarter of 2001, ahead of many other spots in our survey. But sellers don't seem to have caught on, which has luxury properties stacking up -- the average time on the market for a big home here recently hit 138 days, up 40% from 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some observers, like high-end developer Christopher Carley say they're seeing signs of a turnaround. Mr. Carley says he's sold four apartments in his company's highest-end building since May; in the six months prior they'd sold just one unit. "Now that the stock market's gone up, confidence is back," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boulder County, Colo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NUMBERS: Luxury market +3.24; luxury median, $780,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCENE: Shift to plains towns on Boulder's east side</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOUGHEST SELL: Mountain subdivisions with Boulder addresses, where some buyers worry about a repeat of last year's forest fires</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vaughn Paul started construction on a four-bedroom, 9,000-square foot place outside Boulder early in 2001, thinking he'd sell for about $2.5 million. But that was before big local employers like IBM and Sun Microsystems started laying people off and the big fires of summer 2002 burned 137,000 acres in the state. The result: "The market kind of dried up," says Mr. Paul, who recently sold the place for $1.9 million -- "well below expectations, that's for sure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, this market has seen one of the biggest dropoffs in our survey -- going from nearly 20% annual upper-end growth in the late `90s to this year's anemic 3.24% (the overall market's doing even worse). The good news for buyers: Low-ball bidding's back here -- in the last year the split between asking and sales price has almost doubled, to 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles County, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NUMBERS: Luxury market, +18.48%; luxury median, $1,250,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCENE: A scramble to trade up from sub-$1 million homes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOUGHEST SELL: 14-room-plus movie-star mansions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things look a lot like 1999 in this corner of the country, with a booming local economy and low interest rates convincing many buyers that now's the time to trade up. "It might be their only opportunity, and they're all jumping," says agent Cecelia Waeschle. And, in fact, while prices in both the luxury and overall markets jumped close to 20%, the volume of sales rose almost as fast (up more than 15% so far this year).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some market watchers are worried that last month's interest-rate jump may slow sales in the $1 million to $2 million range (that's "move-up" here). And already slumping: The ultra high-end $10 million-plus market. "There just aren't enough buyers," says Ms. Waeschle. (Memo to Madonna: It may be time to mark down that $11 million Beverly Hills place -- after all, you paid only $6.5 million in 2000.)</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers ratcheted up their spending in July, while disposable income posted its biggest gain in more than a year, the government said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending climbed 0.8% in July, after rising an upwardly revised 0.6% in June, the Commerce Department reported. Personal income rose 0.2% in the month after climbing 0.4% in June, it said. For June, income previously had been estimated as climbing 0.3% and spending was earlier forecast as rising 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The July report on income and spending was in line with expectations on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government report showed that disposable personal income, or income after taxes, climbed 1.5% in July, the biggest increase since January 2002. The government said tax payments decreased because of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. Excluding that special factor, disposable income would have gone up 0.2%, the Commerce Department said. Disposable income advanced 0.4% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lou Crandall, chief economist for Wrightson ICAP, said the 1.5% advance was no surprise. "We knew the tax cut happened," he said. "That helps put the very strong spending numbers in perspective."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income was 3.8% in July. In June, the rate was 3.1%, the Commerce Department said. "The basic point is that the tax cut is large enough so even if much is saved, there's still going to be a significant spending impact," Mr. Crandall said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its report, the Commerce Department said spending on durable goods, or items meant to last three years or more, advanced 2.1% in July, following an increase of 1% in June. Spending on nondurable goods increased 0.8% after also rising 0.8% in June. Spending on services climbed 0.5% in July after a 0.4% rise in the previous month.</p>

Big-Ticket Orders Increase
For Second Straight Month;
Consumer Confidence Rises

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- U.S. demand for big-ticket products increased solidly
for the second straight month in July, indicating the U.S. manufacturing
sector may be rebounding.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods --
expensive items such as kitchen appliances that are built to last at
least three years -- climbed 1% in July after a rise of 2.6% a month
earlier. That is a marked improvement from earlier reports, when new
orders fell 1.4% in April and were flat in May.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report showed business spending is picking up. Excluding aircraft,
shipments of nondefense capital goods -- items meant to last at least 10
years -- jumped 2.9%, which raises the current quarter's shipments above
second-quarter results.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders for nondefense capital goods, including aircraft, rose 0.4% in
July, a third consecutive monthly gain that followed a 2.1% rise in
June.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"This represents the most meaningful evidence of a pickup in business
capital spending seen in the expansion to date," said Peter Kretzmer, an
economist at Bank of America Corp.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, the Conference Board, a private research group, reported
that its index of U.S. consumer confidence rose to 81.3 in August from a
revised 77 in July. Economists had expected a reading of 80 for the
latest month. The index was at 100 in 1985.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The index, which is based on a survey of 5,000 U.S households,
measures general optimism about the U.S economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Within the generally positive August report was one notable sign that
consumers have doubts about employment prospects. Delos Smith, a
Conference Board economist, said many U.S. consumers are worried that
their jobs will be moved to foreign countries.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In another report, the U.S. housing market showed its first signs of
cooling after months of hot sales that helped stabilize the economy.
Though record-low mortgage interest rates and rising home values have
kept the market strong, rising interest rates are expected to begin
slowing home sales.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
New-home sales fell 2.9% in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 1.17 million, the Commerce Department said. The July sales figure
compares with record June new-home sales of an annual rate of 1.2
million, which was revised upward to a 8.3% gain. The preliminary June
estimate showed a 4.7% increase to an annual rate of 1.16 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The median price of a new home rose 3.7% to $191,500 in July, compared
with an increase of 9.1% a year earlier.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On Monday, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of
existing homes rose in July to a record 6.12 million annual rate, an
indicator of the overall strength of the housing market. But the
association said rising interest rates are beginning to slow mortgage
applications.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In manufacturing, the gains in big-ticket products were broad-based.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sales of motor vehicles and parts rose 5.5%, boosted by aggressive
incentives and low interest rates. Machinery orders climbed 1.8%, while
orders for computers and electronic products rose 1.9%. Orders for
defense-related capital goods fell 12.2% in July.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Toll Brothers Inc.'s fiscal-third-quarter net income jumped 27% amid a
surge in U.S. housing sales and a record number of contracts. The
luxury-home builder reported net income of $68.2 million, or 90 cents a
share, for the period ended July 31, compared with $53.5 million, or 70
cents a share, for the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 19% to $693.7
million from $580.7 million a year earlier, as housing sales grew 20% to
$678.5 million. The company, based in Pennsylvania, said it expects the
housing market to continue to strengthen, given reports of an improving
economy and the strength of current demand.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing U.S. homes unexpectedly rose to their highest levels ever for July, as mortgage rates fell during June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales increased to a record annual rate of 6.12 million for July, a 5% rise from June's 5.83 million annual pace, said the National Association of Realtors. Analysts expected existing-home sales at an annual rate of 5.90 million.</p>

Sales of Homes
In U.S. Increase

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing U.S. homes unexpectedly surged to
their highest levels ever in July, after mortgage rates fell to record
lows in June, the National Association of Realtors said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home resales increased to a record 6.12 million annual rate in July, a
5% rise from June's 5.83 million annual pace. Analysts had expected
existing home sales to come in at a 5.9 million rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It's astonishing news. The low rates in June are what created the
record-setting home-sales pace in July," said NAR Chief Economist David
Lereah. "We can safely assume there was some fence-jumping in July as
people thought mortgage rates were going up."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to its
lowest level ever at 5.23% in June. Since then, mortgage rates have been
on the rise, hitting 6.28% last week, according to Freddie Mac. "The
record performance in this month's numbers is most probably the peak in
housing we'll observe," Mr. Lereah said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
U.S. mortgage rates have risen sharply in recent weeks, which Mr.
Lereah predicted would result in a 4% to 5% drop in existing home sales
in the next few months. He expects mortgage rates will likely hit 6.5%
by the end of 2004.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The U.S. housing market has remained strong for the past several
years, even weathering the 2001 recession. Economists expect the housing
market to lose some steam in the near term amid rising interest rates,
but don't expect it to slow sharply.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The question is does it hold in at a very high level or suddenly
begin weakening? There is no evidence it's suddenly weakening despite
the rise in interest rates," said Jim O'Sullivan, economist at UBS
Warburg. "The more likely scenario is you're flat to down modestly as
other parts of the economy kick in," he said, adding that the housing
market likely peaked in July.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists say the record rise in existing home sales and in home
prices in July is good news for the economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"For now, the rise in prices and surge in activity will both
contribute to increased confidence and spending," said Ian Shepherdson,
chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The inventory of homes on the market fell to 4.7 months in July from
June's 5.1 months, the NAR said. The median home price increased to a
record $182,100 in July, compared with a revised $175,000 in June. The
median home price in July is up 12.1% from a year earlier.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Existing home sales among the regions were strong, the NAR said. In
the Northeast, sales were up 7.7% while in the Midwest sales rose 3.9%.
Home resales in the South gained 7% and the West region saw sales
advance 1.9%. PBA6044

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building activity rose to a 17-year high in July, showing that the housing sector continues to be a driving force in U.S. economic growth despite recent increases in mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose a higher-than-expected 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized pace of 1.872 million, the Commerce Department said. That compares with a revised 5.7% increase in June to a 1.845 million rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect that housing activity will remain strong in the next several months but then cool late in the year in lagged response" to increasing mortgage rates, said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America Corp.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi-UBS retail chain-store sales index fell 0.5% for the week ended Aug. 16, compared with the week before, on a seasonally adjusted, comparable-store basis. The retail report said the recent power blackout in the East and upper Midwest had a minimal effect on store sales. In fact, the Northeast had the strongest sales, in part because of a boost in sales of blackout-related products such as generators, batteries, bicycles and water.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- There are signs that the long downward spiral of the U.S. manufacturing sector may have hit bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported Friday that orders for durable goods, items meant to last three years or longer, rose a stronger-than-expected 2.1% in June, the largest gain in nearly a year. Shipments rose 1.3% in June and unfilled orders increased 0.1%. Orders for May, meanwhile, were revised upward to unchanged from a previously estimated decline of 0.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the improvement in orders is hardly enough to signal that manufacturing is out of the woods, it may suggest that the long-suffering industry could be poised for better times ahead. "I think manufacturing has turned the corner," said Ken Mayland, economist at ClearView Economics in Cleveland. Economists had expected durable-goods orders to show strong growth in June based on improvement in several regional manufacturing surveys. However, the size of the June gain was larger than most had anticipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Rosenberg, chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said the durable-goods report, when combined with other recent positive economic news, means that economic growth in the third quarter will show an improvement compared with the anemic second quarter. "The third quarter is looking good," he said. "Not great, but good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosenberg said the big question now is whether rising long-term interest rates will interfere with the recovery and "set the seeds for the economy slowing in the fourth quarter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The June durable-goods report showed broad gains, with declines in orders only for fabricated metal products, down 0.4%, and a 9.6% plunge in orders for communications equipment. Transportation orders rose 3.9%, led by a 20% jump in nondefense aircraft and parts. Within the transportation category, orders for motor vehicles rose 2.2% and defense-aircraft orders were up 2.5%. Excluding transportation, durable-goods orders rose 1.4%. Defense capital-goods orders climbed 15.5%. Excluding defense, overall orders rose 1.7% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall capital-goods orders were up 3.5%, while orders for nondefense capital goods rose 2%. These gains in orders for goods meant to last 10 years or more suggest businesses are beginning to spend on investment, economists said. Excluding aircraft, spending on nondefense capital goods rose 0.6%. The Commerce Department also reported Friday that new-home sales climbed 4.7% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.16 million, a record. In a separate report, also released Friday, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes edged down 0.3% last month to a 5.83 million annual rate, still a healthy level, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June new-home sales were boosted by a 32.3% surge in the Northeast and a 9.8% jump in the Midwest. A 0.9% increase in the South and a 2.7% gain in the West brought new-home sales in those regions to new records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of new homes on the market fell to a 3.6 months' supply in June from a revised 3.7 months' supply in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed that average home prices moderated during the month. The average price for a new home dropped to $243,500 from $245,800 in May. The median price for a new home, the midpoint of all prices, dropped to $187,000 in June from $197,600 in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales were weaker in June than had been expected but are still on track to set a record this year. The inventory of existing homes on the market rose to 5.1 months in June from May's revised 4.8 months, NAR said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price increased to $176,500 in June, compared with a revised $166,400 in May. Existing-home sales among the regions were mixed. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Bureau of Economic Research said the U.S. economic recession that began in March 2001 ended eight months later, not long after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists concluded more than a year ago that the recession ended in late 2001. But yesterday's declaration by the NBER -- a private, nonprofit economic research group that is considered the official arbiter of recession timing -- came after a lengthy internal debate over whether there can be an economic recovery if the labor market continues to contract. The bureau's answer: a decisive yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When calling the end to a recession, the NBER focuses on several economic indicators, but two have been especially important: changes in employment and gross domestic product, which is the value of the nation's output of goods and services. Since the fourth quarter of 2001, GDP has expanded slowly but consistently -- rising 4% through March of 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers, however, have eliminated 938,000 payroll jobs since November 2001. In addition, 150,000 people have dropped out of the labor force because they are discouraged about their job prospects, according to the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It has been an inadequate recovery," said N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, who served on the NBER committee that determines recession dates until he joined the Bush administration earlier this year. He said the White House is expecting growth to accelerate to a rate of slightly less than 4% in the months ahead, which should begin to bring down unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's long-running debate on the timing of the recession sheds light on broader structural shifts that have made this business cycle much different from previous cycles and on how the economy responded to the shocks of Sept. 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In typical recoveries since the end of World War II, economic output has bounced back sharply as businesses rushed to rebuild inventories and invest in new equipment. With demand for their products and services growing more quickly than their ability to produce, managers soon started hiring additional workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, economic growth has been unusually slow -- a product of intense competition from abroad, the hangover from the technology and stock-market collapse, terrorism concerns and other factors. At the same time, the productivity of workers has been unusually strong, meaning that business can meet sluggish demand for products while still eliminating jobs. The result has been a recovery in the eyes of economists that doesn't feel like one to many workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is meaningless from the point of view of people worried about their jobs, but meaningful for economic researchers," said Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning Washington think tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NBER acknowledged as much in its statement announcing that the recession ended 20 months ago. "The main reason that the committee's decision in this episode was particularly difficult was the divergent behavior of employment," the NBER said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In terms of the decline in output, it ranks as a relatively mild recession," said Robert Hall, a Stanford University economics professor who is chairman of the NBER committee. "The labor market side is quite different."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hall was among those committee members who had reservations about calling the recession over when employment was so weak. Mr. Mankiw, who is on leave from Harvard University, had similar reservations before joining the Bush administration earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the gap between growing GDP and falling employment persisted, "there was a gradual shift of opinion on the committee that employment should be demoted in the committee decision," said Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University professor and committee member. He had been quietly lobbying for several months to declare an end to the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite yesterday's announcement, many executives -- still stung by the profit collapse of 2001 and the stock-price decline that came with it -- are only now becoming more confident about the economy. And even they say they are hedging their bets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the decision to mark the recovery at November 2001, just two months after Sept. 11, also underscores the remarkable resilience of the U.S. economy. After the attacks, many economists believed the blow would devastate an already-frail economy. Forecasters slashed output estimates and policy makers in Washington prepared new ways to stimulate the economy. But consumer spending rebounded quickly, as the automobile sector enticed households into spending with 0%-financing deals. The housing sector soared, thanks to falling interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Businesses led the way and made very swift adaptations to maintain something resembling a normal pace of production," says David Resler, an economic forecaster with Nomura Securities International Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, Mr. Resler said the NBER's decision speaks to the changing nature of business cycles. The downturn itself was very shallow, in terms of lost economic output. Mr. Resler estimates that economic output contracted by just 0.6% during the 2001 downturn, the second-smallest output loss on record. It also was among the shorter contractions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are various reasons for this. Monetary policy has become more effective at counteracting downturns. Meanwhile, labor markets and pricing have become more flexible, thanks to more than two decades of deregulation. That allows companies to adjust to signs of waning demand. Increased use of technology has added to this flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But short, shallow recessions are giving way to long, arduous recoveries that do little to improve the job market. In the six quarters since the end of the recession, GDP has expanded on average at a 2.6% annual rate, compared with a 5.3% average expansion during the previous eight recoveries. Meanwhile, the job market's performance during this recovery has been the worst on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NBER committee is notoriously slow in making its declarations on the timing of the business cycle. Still, the 20 months it waited to declare the recession's end was slightly shorter than the 21 months it took to declare the end of the 1990-91 recession. That, too, was a so-called jobless recovery, though the job losses weren't as severe as they have been lately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, housing construction in June climbed to the highest level since the beginning of the year. The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the number of housing projects builders broke ground on rose 3.7% in June from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.8 million units, the strongest showing since January. In another report, the Labor Department said that for the work week ending July 12, new applications for jobless benefits dropped by a seasonally adjusted 29,000, to 412,000, a three-week low. </p>

U.S. Retail Sales
Rose 0.5% in June;
Auto Spending Fell
</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
U.S. consumers welcomed summer by spending more on household goods and
personal items, according to a government report which suggested
consumer spending is accelerating after languishing for several months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department said Tuesday that U.S. retail sales increased
0.5% in June, after remaining unchanged in May. Sales rose at stores
selling building materials, clothing, furniture and sporting goods. Auto
sales fell slightly, as did sales at restaurants and bars. Excluding
auto sales, retail sales rose 0.7% last month after a 0.1% rise in May.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"You're starting to see people feel much more optimistic about what is
going on out there," said Jane Saltzman, executive vice president of
Discovery Channel Stores, a private specialty retailer. Ms. Saltzman
said Discovery had been negatively affected by bad weather earlier in
the year and then by uncertainties tied to the war with Iraq, but has
seen improvements since the war wound down. She said the retailer, which
has about 150 stores around the country, saw double-digit increases in
sales for stores opened at least one year during June.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It isn't clear at this point whether the acceleration in sales will
prove sustainable. While the cash flow of many households likely will be
improving in the months ahead -- because of federal tax cuts and the
benefits of mortgage refinancing -- the job market continues to
languish. That has led to a drag on incomes. But economists welcomed
Tuesday's report as a sign that an anticipated pickup in economic growth
is materializing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumers are in "great financial shape," said Susan Sterne, chief
economist with Economic Analysis Associates Inc. in Greenwich,
Connecticut. "They've paid down their expensive debt with home loans.
They've put money in the bank. They have liquidity galore. The only
thing they don't have is an increase in jobs."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Federal Reserve on Tuesday said it expects the nation's gross
domestic product -- the broadest measure of overall output -- to grow by
3.75% to 4.75% between the fourth quarter of this year and the fourth
quarter of 2004. If that forecast proves true, it would mark a
significant acceleration from the sub-2% growth that has prevailed for
the past nine months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic
output, and it also has been the economy's mainstay in recent years.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Business spending on new equipment continued to languish in May while tumbling mortgage rates propelled new and existing home sales upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods, or items meant to last three years or longer, fell by 0.3% to $168.33 billion for May from April, after falling 2.4% for April from March, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports showed many of the same trends in place for the past year: business investment hampered by worries over war, terrorism, weak profits, increased scrutiny of corporate behavior and overcapacity in some industries. But mortgage rates, which plunged in the wake of the Federal Reserve's May 6 announcement that it was worried about inflation falling too low, have underpinned the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The durable-goods report suggests businesses remain reluctant to spend. Orders for capital goods excluding defense and aircraft fell 0.5%. "The durable-goods sector remains very soft. It contradicts the notion that manufacturing is sharply turning around," said Peter Kretzmer, economist at Banc of America Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding a decline in military orders, overall durable-goods orders would have risen by 0.3%. Orders for computers and electronic products rose 1.2% and those for fabricated metal products rose 2.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the housing front, sales of new, single-family homes surged 12.5% for May from April to a record seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.157 million, the Commerce Department said, breaking the previous record set in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of new homes on the market fell to a 3.5 months' supply from 3.9 months. The average home price rose to $242,500 from $234,600. The median price for a new home, the midpoint of all prices, rose to $195,200 from $185,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, sales of existing homes increased 1.2% to a 5.92 million annual rate from April, the National Association of Realtors said. "The pace of home sales so far this year has been higher than projected," said the association's chief economist, David Lereah. "It all comes down to historically low mortgage interest rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes on the market fell to 4.7 months for May from April's 5.1 months, the association said. The median home price increased to $167,000 for May, compared with a revised $163,700 for April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One concern is if mortgage rates stabilize or head higher, home sales and mortgage refinancings -- which give homeowners extra spending power -- could suffer. The Mortgage Bankers Association of America said mortgage applications declined 9% last week from the prior week as the average mortgage rate rose a tenth of a percentage point, though applications remain at double their year-earlier levels. Applications for both purchases and refinancings dropped.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
NEW YORK -- The dollar weakened against the euro and yen amid upbeat
home-sales figures, lower-than-expected U.S. durable-goods data and the
U.S. Federal Reserve quarter-percentage-point cut in interest rates.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In afternoon trading the dollar declined to 117.50 yen, from 117.89
yen late Tuesday. The euro was trading at $1.1600, strengthening from
$1.1510 on Tuesday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department said Wednesday that new-home sales jumped
12.5% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.157 million
units. That eclipses the previous record of 1.057 million units set in
September 2002. New-home sales rose a revised 1% to an annual rate of
1.028 million units in April.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, existing-home sales climbed 1.2% to a 5.92 million annual
rate from a revised 5.85 million pace in April, according to the
National Association of Realtors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Also Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that May
durable-goods orders fell unexpectedly, weighed down by lower capital
goods, electrical equipment and transportation orders that suggested the
U.S. manufacturing sector's recovery remains fragile.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders for durable goods, or items meant to last three years or
longer, fell by 0.3% to $168.33 billion last month. This follows a
revised 2.4% fall in April orders, which were previously estimated as a
2.3% decline.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"On face value they were weaker than expected, but this series of data
is very volatile, so I wouldn't read too much into it," said David
Mozina, director of foreign exchange for Bank of America Securities in
New York.

U.S. Gets Signs of Strengthening

May Data Could Ease Fears
Of Deflation With Pickup

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- A series of indicators for May released Tuesday showed
strengthening U.S. economic activity and a stabilization in recent
deflationary trends, igniting new speculation on the scope of an
expected reduction in interest rates when the U.S. Federal Reserve meets
next week.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
An increase in lodging and housing costs in May pushed underlying U.S.
inflation up at its fastest rate in nine months, the U.S. Labor
Department said in a report that could soothe fears of deflation, or a
prolonged general decline in prices. At the same time, falling energy
costs kept overall consumer prices steady. Separate reports for the
month showed industrial production edging higher and a surge in
home-building activity, extending the housing market's role as a major
support for the U.S. economy this year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Market watchers focused most closely on the consumer-price index, the
most widely used gauge of U.S. inflation, which was unchanged last
month. But the so-called core CPI, which strips out volatile food and
energy prices, gained 0.3%. It was the biggest rise in the core index
since a matching gain in August last year. Economic analysts had
expected the overall CPI to drop 0.1% and the core rate to gain 0.1%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Many Fed watchers believe the U.S. central bank will lower interest
rates, perhaps as early as its next meeting. However, opinion has been
split on whether the Fed will cut rates by a half or a quarter of a
percentage point. The blip in price inflation may scale back some
expectations that the Fed will cut by the more aggressive half point.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tuesday's CPI figure "really speaks to whether or not the Fed moves,"
said Michael Woolfolk, a currency strategist at Bank of New York. "I
think we're solidly back to 25 basis points [0.25 percentage point]. It
takes a willing suspension of disbelief to say the economy is at risk of
corrosive deflation."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Cloherty, a fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse First
Boston, agreed. The market has trimmed bullish expectations of a
half-point cut, but a quarter-point cut is still "fully priced in" to
the market, Mr. Cloherty said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said the central bank is on guard
against deflation, however remote the possibility. When prices fall
generally, profit margins get squeezed, which can prompt businesses to
cut payrolls. It also becomes harder for businesses to pay off debt,
which is a fixed cost.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
U.S. Treasurys prices eased as markets reacted to fresh perceptions
that the deflation threat had been exaggerated. By midmorning Tuesday,
the benchmark 10-year note was down 11/32, taking its yield to 3.21%, up
from 3.18% late Monday. The 30-year bond declined 14/32 for a yield of
4.26%, up from 4.23%. The dollar also received new support in
foreign-exchange trading, as speculation grew that the Fed would stop
short of an aggressive 0.5-percentage-point cut in the federal-funds
rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Among other data released Tuesday, the Federal Reserve said U.S.
industrial output edged up 0.1% in May and capacity use was unchanged at
74.3%, adding to evidence that the manufacturing sector may have begun
to stabilize. The 0.1% rise followed a 0.6% drop in April, revised from
an initial estimate of a 0.5% fall.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The manufacturing sector has been particularly hard hit throughout the
U.S. economic slump. The slight uptick in the May industrial-production
reading, coupled with two recent economic surveys, suggest the battered
and underutilized sector may be turning a corner.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The U.S. Commerce Department reported Tuesday that housing starts rose
by a larger-than-expected 6.1% to a seasonally adjusted 1.732 million
annual rate. This follows a revised 6.3% fall in April to a 1.632
million rate. April starts were previously reported as falling 6.8% to a
1.630 million annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report was stronger than analysts had expected. A Dow Jones
Newswires/CNBC poll of economists predicted May housing starts would
rise 5.5% to a 1.720 million annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The housing sector of the U.S. economy has remained strong for the
past several years and defied analysts' expectations as it weathered the
2001 economic recession. Record-low mortgage rates continue to underpin
the housing market. The May report showed that building permits, an
indicator of future building activity, rose for the second straight
month, expanding 3.7% to a 1.788 million annual rate.

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip </div><div>663 words</div><div>3 June 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- In one of the first signs of a postwar economic bounce, new orders for manufactured goods expanded in May after two consecutive monthly declines, a survey of purchasing managers showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said its overall index of manufacturing activity, based on the survey, rose to 49.4 in May from 45.4 in April. While it was the third month below 50, which marks the dividing line between an expanding and contracting industrial economy, components of the index were more upbeat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the subindexes for new orders and production rose above 50 for the first time in three months, and the subindex for the backlog of orders topped 50 for the first time in 11 months. However, employment contracted again, for the 32nd month in a row, the survey found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Supply managers' comments seem to be split among those who are starting to see improvement, those who see no improvement in sight, and those who are uncertain as to the direction," said Norbert Ore, chairman of the ISM's manufacturing-survey committee and a purchasing executive at Georgia-Pacific Corp. "This is not really unusual when the economy is at a crossroads."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index hardly suggests the robust activity of a normal recovery. After expanding most of last year, manufacturing had sunk into a recession in recent months. While Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan blamed jitters and high energy prices caused by the conflict with Iraq, others blamed the continuing adjustment of consumers and corporations to the decline in asset values and excess capacity, a legacy of the burst stock bubble of the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the report was the first hard evidence to back up optimists like Mr. Greenspan who until now had relied mostly on the buoyant financial markets and rising consumer sentiment to make their case. "It helps give the optimists a little bit more ammunition but it's got further to go," said Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're all so impatient, the minute the war ended, we said, where's the recovery?" said Citigroup economist Robert DiClemente. "But we're just now getting to the point where hard data are beginning to reflect postwar behavior. We're on the road back. The question is, is there really a dynamic self-feeding upturn? Are businesses enthusiastic and not just grudgingly replacing obsolete equipment?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, in a sign that other parts of the economy remained moribund as the Iraq war ended, the Commerce Department said construction spending declined 0.3% in April from March. Construction on houses and apartment buildings fell 0.3%, the second straight decline, while nonresidential private construction, such as on stores, offices, factories and hospitals, tumbled 2.6%. Public construction, which includes roads, sewer systems and schools, rose 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, home prices rose in the first quarter at their slowest rate in almost five years, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said yesterday. The price of homes rose 0.94% in the first quarter from the fourth, the smallest increase since the second quarter of 1998, according to the agency, which regulates mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were up 6.5% from a year earlier, the slowest pace since 1999. Though hardly evidence of a bursting bubble, the report suggests the economy will get less support this year from homeowners borrowing against their rising home values.</p>

Grill Makers Hope Charcoal Can Reignite Sales

Briquette-Loving Holdouts
Enjoy Fancy New Features;
A `More Interesting Heat'

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
BRYANT HIXSON IS NUTS about his new stainless-steel grill, which came
complete with a griddle and a built-in Champagne bucket. But his
favorite feature is even more surprising: He can fire it up with
charcoal briquettes. "It's like an adventure," says the Hollywood,
Florida, advertising executive, who shelled out $6,000 (5,053 euros) for
a new "dual-fuel" model.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After more than a decade of pushing ever-fancier gas grills, the $2.9
billion U.S. barbecue industry has a new strategy: lumps of coal. To try
to capture the one-third of grillers who still insist on cooking the
old-fashioned way, makers are pushing everything from dual-fuel grills
(the outdoor equivalent of gas/electric ranges) to gas-ignition charcoal
cookers that cut down on the long wait for the coals. Then there are the
special smoker attachments that add a wood-fired element to gas grills.
And to fuel it all, they're also pushing "natural lump" charcoal,
boutique wood chips -- even fruitwood planks that supposedly infuse fish
with flavor.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For the industry, it's all an attempt to reignite grill sales -- sales
of gas grills grew just 3% from 2000 to 2002, one-sixth the rate of the
previous two years. Indeed, while folks have increasingly stocked their
outdoor kitchens with everything from gas-powered woks to rotisseries,
they're not actually using them that much. Just 33% of Americans
actually use their grills regularly, according to Harry Balzer, who
tracks kitchen and appliance trends for NPD Foodworld. Backyard grilling
is "tapped out," Mr. Balzer says. With the fancy new charcoal-burning
models, makers are "trying to get the trend back on track again."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Europe, barbecuing is still not as popular as in the U.S., but that
is changing quickly. "Barbecue fever came from America to Europe in the
last 10 years," says Marcus Zimmerman, owner of Visiontrade AG, an
importer and distributor of American-made barbecues based in
Zollikerberg, Switzerland. Indeed, in Europe, gas grills are growing
more popular at the moment, says Rolf Zubler, president and chief
executive of the World Barbecue Association in Neuhiusen It Rheinfalls,
Switzerland.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Boston architect Jeff Stikeman recently went back to charcoal after
sticking with gas through 12 years and four grills. With gas, he found
himself grilling infrequently. Then a friend started bragging about his
new charcoal grill, a ceramic cooker called the Big Green Egg -- he even
e-mailed pictures of steaks sizzling on it. So Mr. Stikeman bought his
own $700 Egg, which can hit nearly 1,000 degrees (538 degrees Celsius)
and cook anything from pizza to pork butt. Now he's grilling meat so
often, he says, he feels like he's on the Atkins diet. The one drawback:
It's ugly. "I'm trying to design a table to go around it so you don't
have to see the whole thing."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Of course, before the advent of the gas grill in the '60s, charcoal
was pretty much the only way to cook burgers. In the decades since then,
backyard chefs have increasingly chosen the speed and ease of gas over
the mess, hassle -- and fuller flavor -- of charcoal. (Purists deride
gas as "not real grilling.") Gas-grill sales first beat out charcoal in
1995, and throughout the '90s, their sales grew by as much as 18% a
year. But now, with growth down, the charcoal holdouts -- many of them
upscale foodies -- have become an increasingly attractive target market
for grill makers. "They have to look for some new customers somewhere,"
says Donna Myers, spokeswoman for the Barbecue Industry Association.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The only problem: Regular charcoal grills are still pretty cheap.
Indeed, a classic charcoal-fired Weber kettle goes for about $80, while
the company's new Summit gas grills can cost almost $2,000. That has
makers adding on the fancy new features -- and upping the price. So
Char-Broil's new dual-fuel grill comes with push-button ignition and a
condiment basket and costs almost $400, while Weber's gas-ignition
Performer lets owners cook with charcoal, but get things going quickly
with gas -- for five times the cost of a kettle. "This way, we play both
sides of the street," says Mike Kempster, Weber's executive vice
president of sales and marketing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
And, of course, once you've paid that much for a grill you can't just
pour on a heap of Matchlight, which is where the "boutique charcoal"
comes in. Among the most popular: irregularly shaped "natural" coals
that dominated sales before briquettes took off in the '60s. Sales have
almost doubled from 1999 to 91,000 tons last year, says the Barbecue
Industry Association. Meanwhile, the biggest cooking-wood purveyor in
the country, WW Wood, based in Pleasanton, Texas, says sales have grown
by an average 18% for the past 10 years. Last year, it introduced three
new flavors: cherry, maple and apple.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Deven Black, an upstate New York grill owner, uses natural lump coal
whenever he can. The appeal? Because the lumps aren't perfectly shaped,
like briquettes, they produce a "less perfect, but more interesting
heat." Even that isn't good enough for Steve Maggetti, who last year
found a boutique wood purveyor on the Internet who express-mails him
cherrywood planks to grill swordfish, mesquite for steak and even
Cabernet-soaked wood chips for his chicken, though the price is steep --
about $1,200 a year. Says the 30-year-old Irvine, California, resident:
"I have a passion and I'm willing to spend the money on it."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Perhaps, but some folks aren't impressed by the industry's
back-to-the-coals plan. Billie Jo Bishop recently got a gas-ignited
charcoal grill as a gift -- and just sold it on eBay. While it cuts down
the time it takes to heat up the grill by about half, it still takes 15
minutes or so to reach prime grilling temperature. The Minnesota
business owner wasn't willing to wait that long. "When you have a
three-year-old, you have to eat when you have to eat," she says.

</div><div class="author">By Patrick Barta </div><div>745 words</div><div>28 May 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence rose for the second consecutive month in May, providing new hope that consumer spending will pick up in the months ahead despite the weak job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board, a private business-research group in New York, said its monthly index of consumer confidence rose to 83.8 in May from 81 in April. The May increase followed a huge jump in consumer confidence in April as consumers applauded the conclusion of the war in Iraq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continued gains in confidence are critical for maintaining a strong level of consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity. "Consumers are still hopeful about the future, and that's the key thing," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pa. "While we may not see a major surge in spending, [the latest data] seem to imply that we'll see steady if not slowly improving expenditures" as long as recent gains hold up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another possible indication that consumers are becoming more optimistic, the U.S. housing market rebounded in April after a string of disappointing sales reports during the first quarter. The National Association of Realtors said that sales of pre-existing homes rose 5.6% in April from the month before to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.84 million units, the fifth-highest level on record. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes increased 1.7% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.028 million homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To investors, yesterday's economic news raised the odds that the long-anticipated economic recovery could take hold during the second half of this year. That view triggered a rally on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 179.97 points to 8781.35.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there were a few causes for concern in yesterday's numbers. Some economists noted, for example, that while the headline consumer-confidence number rose, the Conference Board's so-called present situation index, consumers' assessment of current conditions, fell to 67.9 from 75.2 in April. Also, the number of consumers who reported that jobs are hard to get jumped to 32.6% in May from 29.4% the prior month. Those who believe jobs are plentiful fell to 12.6% from 13% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That concerns some economists because they fear that the recent resurgence in consumer confidence could lose steam and reverse course -- much as it did following the Gulf War in 1991 -- if the job market doesn't improve soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said he sees no reason why consumer spending can't keep growing even as the unemployment rate rises. He says that in past recessions, an improvement in consumer spending typically took root before the unemployment rate reached its cyclical peak. He says he wouldn't be surprised if the unemployment rate rose to 6.5% over the next year from its current rate of 6%, even as consumer spending maintains its pace or accelerates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales, meanwhile, could pick up even more steam if interest rates keep falling. Mortgage rates are already at record low levels, according to Freddie Mac, and other recent data from the Mortgage Bankers Association of America show a significant pickup in applications for home-purchase mortgages over the last several weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts point out, however, that the U.S. housing market is clearly cooling in one key respect: Home-price appreciation is slowing, as more homes come on to the market. In the existing home-sales report, for example, the inventory of available homes rose 10.3% from March, implying a 5.1-month supply of homes at the current sales pace, up from 4.3 months of supply in December 2002. The median home price rose 6.8% from a year earlier to $163,400, compared with a home-price growth rate of 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2002. The median price is the midpoint -- half the homes sold for more, while half sold for less. The average home price rose just 2% in April to $268,200. The new-homes report also showed weaker price appreciation, though the inventory of new homes contracted slightly.</p>

The U.S. housing market rebounded in April and consumer confidence
rose to its highest level in six months in May, providing new hope U.S.
consumers will keep spending heavily despite a weak job market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In one of two reports released Tuesday about the U.S. housing market,
the National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing homes
rose 5.6% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.84 million
units, the fifth-highest level on record. Meanwhile, the U.S. Commerce
Department said that sales of new homes increased 1.7% in April to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.028 million homes. Those increases
followed declines in home sales in February and March, which many
economists attributed to bad weather and worries related to the Iraq
war.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, the Conference Board said that its monthly index of
consumer confidence rose for the second consecutive month to 83.8 in May
from 81 in April. The May increase followed a huge jump in consumer
confidence in April with the conclusion of the war in Iraq.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One concern among economists is that the recent resurgence in consumer
confidence could lose steam and reverse course -- much as it did
following the Gulf War in 1991 -- if the job market doesn't improve
soon. There is some evidence that that scenario could be in the cards
this time as well. The Conference Board's "present situation" index that
measures current conditions, for example, fell in May to 67.9 from 75.2
in April. Consumers reporting jobs are hard to get rose to 32.6% from
29.4%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the percentage of consumers who believe more jobs will become
available increased to 17.8% in May from 16.4% in April. Ian
Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New
York, said he sees no reason why consumer spending can't keep growing
even as the unemployment rate rises. He says that in past recessions, an
improvement in consumer spending typically took root before the
unemployment rate reached its cyclical trough. He says he wouldn't be
surprised if the unemployment rate rose to 6.5% over the next year from
its current rate of 6%, even as consumer spending maintains its pace or
accelerates.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The rebound in the housing data, meanwhile, provides further evidence
that consumers are still willing to spend on big-ticket items, so long
as there are powerful incentives for them to do so. In the case of the
housing market, that incentive has come in the form of low interest
rates. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage recently fell
to 5.34%, according to Freddie Mac, the lowest rate ever recorded by the
mortgage company.

housing market, that incentive has come in the form of low interest
rates. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage recently fell
to 5.34%, according to Freddie Mac, the lowest rate ever recorded by the
government-sponsored mortgage company.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The decline in rates has accelerated in recent weeks, making monthly
payments for homes even cheaper. Other recent data from the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America show a significant pick-up in
applications for home-purchase mortgages over the last several weeks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Analysts point out, however, that even with the stimulus of low
mortgage rates, the U.S. housing market doesn't appear to be as red-hot
as it was a year ago. Most notably, home-price appreciation has slowed
in recent months as more supply has come on the market. In the existing
home-sales report, for example, the inventory of available homes rose
10.3% from March, implying a 5.1-month supply of homes at the current
sales pace, up from 4.3 months of supply as recently as late 2002. The
median home price, meanwhile, rose 6.8% from a year earlier to $163,400,
compared with a growth rate of 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2002. The
median price is the midpoint -- half the homes sold for more, while half
sold for less. The average home price rose just 2% in April to $268,200.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The price data in the new-homes report  showed a similar cooling. The
median price for a new home fell 1.1% from a year earlier to $185,100,
while the average price rose 3% to $235,000.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data suggest the U.S. economy hasn't gained as much momentum since the end of major fighting in Iraq as many economists had hoped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said its closely watched monthly index of manufacturing activity fell to 45.4 in April from 46.2 in March. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the sector. Meanwhile, the U.S. Labor Department said yesterday that the number of new workers filing for unemployment benefits declined by 13,000 to 448,000 in the week ended April 26. But the current level remains consistent with a flat or rising jobless rate, and the Labor Department's four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out weekly fluctuations, rose to 442,000, the highest level in more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two reports "splashed a bucket of cold water on the view that there was a tremendous buildup of pent-up demand" postponed by the conflict with Iraq, says David Rosenberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch &amp;Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent indicators have provided a much more positive read on the postwar economy. Consumer confidence recorded its second-largest monthly gain to date in April, and oil prices have declined. Corporate profits have been running stronger than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many economists have reserved judgment on a possible postwar rebound until they see more data on the labor market and the manufacturing sector. Although they still believe the economy is poised for a rebound, there is still much uncertainty over when that recovery will take root and how strong it will be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report yesterday, the Labor Department said nonfarm business productivity, or the amount of worker output per hour, grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.6% in the first quarter. While productivity growth has clearly slowed from its pace of a year ago, the rise was an improvement from the fourth quarter's 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When companies become more productive, they are able to generate more goods per employee without raising costs, boosting profits and the economy's ability to grow without igniting inflation. But in the short run, companies that are increasing productivity don't need to hire as many new workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists were unfazed by yesterday's data. Nariman Behravesh, an economist at Global Insight in Lexington, Mass., said the recent surge in consumer confidence should lead to more consumer spending, which ultimately should lead to more production and more hiring. He said he expects the economy to grow at about a 3.5% annual rate in the second half of the year, after expanding at a 1.6% annual rate in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, construction spending fell 1% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $868.5 billion, the Commerce Department said yesterday.</p>

Economy in U.S. Grew
By 1.6% in First Quarter

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The U.S. economy continued to sputter during the first three months of
the year as growth in consumer spending slowed and companies cut both
capital spending and inventory restocking. But consumer sentiment moved
higher in April, suggesting better economic times ahead.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The economy grew at a 1.6% annual rate in the first quarter, barely up
from a 1.4% pace in the fourth quarter of 2002, the U.S. Commerce
Department said Friday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co., said gross
domestic product -- the broadest measure of national economic output --
was held down by one-time factors, including war worries and bad winter
weather. "Now that spring is here and the war is over, I think the
second quarter will be considerably better," Mr. Sohn said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The University of Michigan said its index of consumer sentiment rose
to 86 for April, up from a reading of 83.2 for mid-April and 77.6 for
March.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a research
firm in Valhalla, New York, said the consumer-sentiment figures suggest
the "consumer is waking up," which should translate into stronger
spending by both consumers and businesses in coming months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, Mr. Sohn said that while economic growth is expected to
improve, he doesn't see strong growth, partly because businesses have
shown no inclination to start hiring again. In fact, recent figures on
first-time claims for unemployment show that businesses are continuing
to lay off workers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists have said the U.S. needs to grow at about a 3.2% pace to
create enough jobs to match the growth in the labor force. Below that
rate, the unemployment rate tends to rise.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumer spending, the bulwark of the economy for the past two years,
grew just 1.4% in the first quarter as households cut spending on
big-ticket items such as cars. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds
of the economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Business spending fell 4.2%, after rising for the first time in two
years during the fourth quarter. Within that category, spending on
equipment and software fell 4.4%. Investment in buildings dropped for
the sixth straight quarter, by 3.4%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Cautious businesses added just $12.8 billion to inventories at an
annual rate, down from $25.8 billion in the fourth quarter; that alone
cut a half percentage point off first-quarter growth. If businesses find
inventory levels too low to meet current-quarter sales, the economy
could get a boost from production needed to build stocks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, the housing market remains healthy. New-home sales in March
rose 7.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.012 million, the
Commerce Department said, from 943,000 in February, a figure that was
sharply revised upward from the original estimate of 854,000. Sales of
existing homes fell 5.6% to a 5.53 million rate in March, according to a
report released by the National Association of Realtors. The new-home
sales data are more current because they reflect contract signings
whereas existing-home sales are based on closings and thus reflect
purchase decisions made about a month before.

NEW YORK -- The dollar fell, as traders remained jittery about the
long-term future of the U.S. economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In afternoon trading, the dollar was at 119.37 yen, down from 120.18
yen late Tuesday in New York. The euro was at $1.0912, up from $1.0813
late Tuesday in New York.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Subdued inflation data and a housing report that reflected a partial
recovery in March added pressure to the market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The U.S. Labor Department reported Wednesday that the consumer price
index rose 0.3% in March after climbing 0.6% in February. The
improvement was mostly due to a slowdown in energy prices. The core
index, which excludes food and energy items, was unchanged for the first
time in four years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that U.S. housing
starts rose by a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.78 million, or a
larger-than-expected 8.3%, the largest monthly percentage gain in six
months, after a steep decline the previous month. Building permits, an
indicator of future building activity, fell 7% in March to a 1.685
million annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, the dollar was weaker against the yen as the pair continues
to be confined to a very tight range.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The market is unwilling to sell the pair" since the Ministry of
Finance policy makers believe the depreciation of the yen is "a key tool
towards ending deflation," said UBS Warburg currency strategist Shahab
Jalinoos.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Japan has been struggling to emerge from a deflationary spiral that
has thwarted economic growth for years and also wants to keep its
currency weak to boost exports.

Higher Energy Costs
Boost U.S. Prices;

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Higher energy costs pushed up U.S. consumer prices in
March, but underlying inflation fell to a 37-year low, as the nation's
weak economy continued to erode corporate pricing power.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, housing starts in the U.S. bounced back in March after a
drop in February caused by bad weather, but it is unclear if sales
remain strong enough to support construction at current levels.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumer prices rose 0.3% in March from February and were up 3% from a
year earlier, the U.S. Labor Department said. The increase was entirely
due to a 4.6% jump in energy prices, which has since likely reversed as
crude-oil prices tumbled after the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Excluding food
and energy, prices were unchanged in March and up just 1.7% from a year
earlier, the lowest annual increase since March 1966.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The special "chained" price index was up just 1.2% from a year
earlier, near the bottom of the 1%-to-2% range that many U.S. Federal
Reserve officials consider ideal. The Fed considers the chained index a
better measure of the cost of living because its basket of goods and
services changes regularly to reflect shifting consumer preferences,
whereas in the regular index, the basket is fixed. By either measure,
"core" inflation has fallen a full percentage point in the last two
years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Intense competition and weak demand are making it harder to raise
prices. Clothing prices fell 0.4% last month. Even persistent inflation
in housing and health care is moderating. In a separate report, the U.S.
Labor Department noted the price of consumer durable goods, such as
cars, furniture and computers, fell 3.3% last year, the biggest such
decline since 1938.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that housing starts
rose 8.3% to a seasonally adjusted 1.78 million annual rate in March,
after falling 10% in February to a 1.644 million rate. Single-family
starts rose 7.7% to a 1.414 million annual rate while starts on
multifamily units or apartment buildings increased 8.9% to a 329,000
annual rate.

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip </div><div>523 words</div><div>2 April 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Manufacturing activity slumped to its lowest level since the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, battered by war jitters, bad weather and the continued unraveling of the late 1990s economic excesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity fell to 46.2 last month from 50.5 in February, below the 50-level that marks the border between expansion and contraction. It was the lowest reading since November 2001, and reflected deteriorating levels of new orders, production and employment, all of which are components of the index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, as with most economic data of late, the report mostly reflects the anxiety that preceded the outbreak of war March 19. The index is based on a survey of purchasing managers at several hundred major industrial companies; the lower the number, the smaller the proportion of respondents reporting increased activity. Norbert Ore, who oversees the survey, said manufacturers typically decide by the 15th how the month as a whole is shaping up, suggesting the March index was largely determined before war broke out. He said if the news on the war is good in coming weeks, "we will see a bounce" in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of America economist Peter Kretzmer said slumping sales in February prompted manufacturers to cut production in March to keep inventories from ballooning. "The key question . . . is to what degree demand stabilized and even recovered in March and then was subsequently impacted by the beginning of the Iraq conflict," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand doesn't appear to have picked up, at least at the consumer level. Chain-store sales tumbled 1.4% last week, the first full week of the war, from the prior week, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi reported. There has been "a more severe early impact on sales in 2003 compared with the comparable period of the 1991 war," Michael Niemira, the report's author, wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The war appears to have slowed demand in a number of industries, including chemicals, electronics, and industrial equipment," the institute said in its report. Meanwhile, higher energy prices put pressure on profit margins, the institute said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bit of positive news is that construction spending fell a smaller-than-expected 0.2% in February from January, the Commerce Department said, due mostly to a 3% drop in public construction, such as roads and schools. Residential construction, such as houses and apartments, rose 0.6%. Most heartening, private nonresidential construction such as office buildings and factories, which has been hampered by high vacancy rates, rose 0.3%, its second monthly gain.</p>

Data on Housing, Durable Goods
Underline Weaker U.S. Economy

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
New data confirmed that U.S. manufacturing and housing sectors
weakened in February, as durable-goods orders and new-home sales fell.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department said that orders for durable goods, or items
meant to last three years or longer, slipped 1.2% in February, partially
erasing a downwardly revised 1.9% gain in January. That month was
previously estimated as a 2.9% gain.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sales of new homes, meanwhile, fell 8.1% in February to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 854,000 units, following a 12.6% decline in
January, the Commerce Department said. Although January's drop wasn't as
bad as the previously estimated 15.1% decline, it's clear the past two
months have been rough for sales of new homes. At the end of last year,
new-home sales were running at a 1.06 million-unit pace. The current
pace is the slowest since August 2000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Much of the February declines in durable goods orders and new-home
sales can be explained by uncertainties related to the war with Iraq and
unusually bad weather. Within the housing report, for example, sales
declined most in the Northeast, which had the worst weather, while
remaining flat in the West. Meanwhile, applications for new purchase
mortgages surged during the last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association
of America said. All that implies the data could bounce back somewhat in
March.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But many economists believe the durable goods and housing reports were
also influenced by broader problems in the economy, including a soft
labor market, that could linger long after the war with Iraq is
resolved. The manufacturing sector continues to suffer from overcapacity
in many industries, especially the telecommunications sector. Home
sales, while not likely to collapse, are expected to trend downward over
the year as the impact of low interest rates wears off.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Unless the labor market snaps back soon, "people better get used to
this, and get used to a long, jobless, `recovery,'" said Richard
Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research in New York. Other
economists, while less pessimistic, nevertheless warned that growth in
the second half of the year could be weaker than previously hoped.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The durable goods report contained several disappointments. Orders for
nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, one proxy for capital
spending, fell 2.8%, after a 4.3% rise in January. Orders for computers
and related products fell 12.3%, and orders for communications equipment
dropped 4.4%. Defense orders surged, as expected, but excluding defense,
total durable goods fell 2.7%.

Data confirmed that the U.S. manufacturing and housing sectors
weakened during February, as durable-goods orders and new-home sales
fell.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Much of February's weakness in durable-goods orders and new-home sales
can be attributed to uncertainties related to the war with Iraq, which

made earlier this year, when the manufacturing sector appeared to be
emerging from its lethargy.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, one proxy for

Home prices still appear to be rising, but at a slower pace. The

$191,100 a year earlier. The average price for a new home was $235,000,
up 4.3% from $225,400 in January and 3.8% higher than $226,500 a year

U.S. Home Sales, Consumer Confidence Slip
</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home sales in the U.S. fell 4.3% in February, but the drop wasn't as
steep as some economists had feared, a sign that housing demand has
remained robust despite a stagnant economy. But consumer confidence
slipped further in early March, raising the possibility of weaker
consumer spending as the war with Iraq continues.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Washington, President George W. Bush damped expectations of a rapid
victory against Iraq, as he urged Congress to speed a $74.7 billion
(70.17 billion euros) first installment of the cost of war with Iraq.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Most of the money sought by Mr. Bush -- $62.6 billion -- would pay for
military and intelligence operations. That reflects both the huge
expense of the buildup in the Gulf region, and the day-to-day cost of
combat. A total of $7.8 billion is provided for the State Department and
foreign aid, including an estimated $1 billion in military assistance
for Israel to bolster its intelligence. Turkey would receive $1 billion,
far less than was first considered when the country was envisioned as a
staging ground for a northern front in the war.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In its monthly report on housing activity, the National Association of
Realtors said that sales of pre-existing homes slipped to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 5.84 million in February. That level was still
the fourth-best month ever, the NAR said, and 1.2% higher than during
the same month a year earlier.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists had expected sales to cool somewhat after January's record
pace of 6.1 million units, and some expressed relief that the February
results weren't worse, given the month's bad weather and the recent
economic and geopolitical uncertainties. Other recent housing data have
been more grim: Sales of new homes, for example, fell 15.1% in January,
and housing starts dropped 11% in February.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home sales are still "remarkably strong given everything else in this
economy," said Susan Sterne, chief economist at Economic Analysis
Associates in Greenwich, Connecticut.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, many economists expect the housing market to gradually cool
this year, and there are many anecdotal reports of softening demand in
some parts of the country. That softening could be exacerbated if
consumer confidence, already dented by a weak labor market and
uncertainties related to Iraq, continues to fall.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Conference Board said Tuesday that its index of consumer
confidence fell to 62.5 in March from 64.8 in February, following a
sharp 15-point slide in February.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumers were particularly downbeat about their job prospects.
Consumers reporting jobs are hard to get rose to 32.3% from 30%, while
the percentage of consumers expecting more jobs to become available
during the next six months declined to 11.1% from 12.4%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"While a quick and successful outcome in the Middle East conflict
would certainly ease some of the uncertainties facing consumers and
therefore boost confidence, it is the economic fundamentals that will
determine whether a rebound is sustainable," said Lynn Franco, director
of the group's Consumer Research Center.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes slowed in February, especially in the South and the West, but remain at very high levels by historical standards. Meanwhile, prices continue to rise, especially in the Northeast, where the supply remains extremely tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say activity in the West so far this month has been strong, and inventories remain particularly low in Southern California, implying that prices will continue to rise in the near future.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence mounted that the housing market slowed in the weeks leading up to the war with Iraq, as consumer confidence continued to slip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its monthly report on housing activity, the National Association of Realtors said sales of pre-existing homes in February dropped 4.3% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.84 million units. While that was still the fourth-best month ever and sales were 1.2% higher than a year earlier, yesterday's NAR report, when combined with other recent data, suggest that the market may have hit its peak for the foreseeable future. "This is the first time I'm saying that maybe there's a little cooling going on," says David Lereah, NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected sales to cool somewhat after January's record pace of 6.10 million units, and some expressed relief that the February results weren't worse given the month's bad weather and the recent economic and geopolitical uncertainties. But Mr. Lereah cautioned that since the existing home-sales numbers are based on closings rather than on new sales contracts, the data might not have captured the full impact of the bad weather that swept much of the U.S. in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The month-over-month decline in sales also came on the heels of several other disappointing housing reports. Last month, the Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes fell 15.1% in January, and it said this month that housing starts fell 11% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales remain very strong by historical standards, in large part due to extraordinarily low interest rates. But economists worry the market could slow more if consumer confidence, battered by a stagnant job market and worries about the war in Iraq, continues to weaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the Conference Board said that its index of consumer confidence fell to 62.5 in March from 64.8 in February, following a sharp 14-point slide in February. Though much of the March weakness is likely due to concerns about a war with Iraq, the survey ended March 18, meaning that the results reflected consumer attitudes before the war began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers were particularly downcast about their job prospects. Consumers reporting jobs are hard to get rose to 32.3% from 30%, while the percentage of consumers expecting more jobs to become available during the next six months declined to 11.1% from 12.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A quick resolution to the Iraq conflict could boost confidence significantly, economists noted. But even if that does occur, "if you don't see a marked turnaround in labor conditions, consumers are going to find themselves faced with the very same conditions they faced prior to the onset of the war," says Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, real-estate agents say they are seeing a change in a handful of markets. John Veneziano, owner of ERA Andrew Realty in the Boston suburbs, says his market has experienced a "big turn" in the past few months, as properties have begun sitting on the market longer and sellers have begun discounting more aggressively. And while there are still lots of buyers, he says, the region's tight inventory has been easing, too. He said he has listings for 52 homes, compared with 20 two months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But inventories nationwide remain tight, and real-estate agents in other parts of the country report that demand is still extremely strong for lower-priced homes. Home-price appreciation, while slowing in some areas, remains robust overall. According to NAR, the median price was $161,600 in February, an increase of 8.2% from a year earlier. The median is the midpoint -- half the homes sold for more while half sold for less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although interest rates are at the lowest levels in a generation, they have risen in recent days. Many economists believe mortgage rates will continue to head up if the war in Iraq is resolved relatively quickly. While that could provide a modest short-term boost to the market, as buyers jump in to lock in lower rates before they move higher, most economists believe that in the long run higher rates will result in weaker housing sales.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home sales are still "remarkably strong given everything else in this
economy," said Susan Sterne, chief economist at Economic Analysis
Associates in Greenwich, Connecticut. She added sales could turn out
stronger than expected this spring due to fears among consumers that
interest rates already may have dropped as low as they will go for the
near future. Those expectations could spur some families that were
sitting on the fence to act quickly before rates go higher.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, most economists expect the housing market to gradually cool
this year, and there are many anecdotal reports of softening demand in
some parts of the country. That softening could be exacerbated if
consumer confidence, already dented by a weak labor market and
uncertainties related to Iraq, continues falling.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Conference Board said Tuesday its index of consumer confidence
fell to 62.5 in March from 64.8 in February, following a sharp 15-point
slide in February. The Conference Board's index of consumer expectations
for the next six months also fell, to 62.5 from 65.7 in February. Though
much of the March weakness is likely due to war concerns, the results
mostly reflected consumer attitudes before the war began.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumers were particularly downbeat about job prospects. Consumers
reporting jobs are hard to get rose to 32.3% from 30%, while the
percentage of consumers expecting more jobs to become available during
the next six months declined to 11.1% from 12.4%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"While a quick and successful outcome in the Middle East conflict
would certainly ease some of the uncertainties facing consumers and
therefore boost confidence, it is the economic fundamentals that will
determine whether a rebound is sustainable," said Lynn Franco, director
of the group's Consumer Research Center. "The end of the Gulf War in
1991 produced a surge in confidence, but labor market conditions quickly
diminished the spark. So if history repeats itself, the current job
scenario will do little to maintain any post-war surge in confidence."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
U.S. imports of steel products fell in February to 1.491 million
metric tons from a revised 2.280 million metric tons in January, the
U.S. Commerce Department reported. In dollar value, February steel
imports fell 26% to $759 million from a revised $1.026 billion in
January. The report compares preliminary February data with revised
January data and isn't seasonally adjusted.The fall in the volume of
steel imports for the month mainly reflected a decline in blooms,
billets, slabs, hot-rolled sheets and wire rods, the agency said.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The stock market took a breather after recent heady gains, with home-building stocks declining on weaker housing data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News that housing starts, which had been soaring, dropped 11% in February, took some wind out of some home builders, with Centex down 26 cents to $52.34, and KB Home off 54 cents to 46.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, U.S. stocks ended modestly higher as investors shrugged off the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged. "The war is on the front burner right now while the economy is on the back burner," said Jim Herrick, head of equity trading at Robert W. Baird. "But once the conflict is resolved, it will be back to corporate earnings and the state of the economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 52.31, or 0.64%, to 8194.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 8.28, or 0.59%, to 1400.55. The last time the tech-laden Nasdaq was at 1400 was on Jan. 16. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 3.66, or 0.42%, to 866.45.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq struggled for much of the day after Applied Materials announced it was making significant cutbacks. But Applied Materials managed to latch onto the generally positive tone of the market, finishing up 41 cents, or 3.1%, to 13.54 despite saying it plans to cut 14% of its work force, or 2,000 employees, as it consolidates facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tobacco stocks fell on reports the Justice Department is demanding that the nation's largest cigarette makers be ordered to forfeit $289 billion in profits. Altria Group fell 2.12, or 6.1%, to 32.60 on the Dow while R.J. Reynolds shed 3.12, or 8.5%, to 33.57.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Procter &amp;Gamble inched up 1.12, or 1.3%, to 86.62 on the Dow after the company won the battle for Wella AG. Separately, P&amp;G raised its fiscal third-quarter guidance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil-field-services stocks were strong despite a drop in the price of crude-oil futures. Halliburton gained 90 cents, or 4.5%, to 20.90 while Schlumberger advanced 1.42, or 3.7%, to 39.50. Market trackers anticipated that a quick and successful war with Iraq would benefit the oil-field-services companies in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A drop in oil prices benefited airlines stocks, as did hope that a swift resolution to a military conflict with Iraq would benefit the group. Among large caps, Southwest Airlines gained 53 cents, or 3.9%, to 14.18 after Credit Suisse First Boston said, unlike its smaller-cap peers, it won't reach a liquidity level that will threaten its solvency no matter how long the war lasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Automobile stocks rallied for a second consecutive session, despite J.P. Morgan's bearish view on the industry Monday. Ford Motor gained 36 cents, or 5%, to 7.55 while General Motors climbed 91 cents, or 2.7%, to 34.12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the decliners, the fixed-line communications stocks took a hit with Qwest Communications off five cents to 4.02 and AT&amp;T down eight cents to 17.15 on the Dow on reports that big telecom carriers are considering additional write-downs in the value of their networks after WorldCom's decision last week to write off a further $34.8 billion in intangibles and network assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Publishing stocks were under water, with Gannett down 1.27 to 72.57 after warning that advertisers may delay or cancel ads if the war begins and saying it expects pension costs this year to be about $50 million greater than in 2002. The company did, however, reiterate its first-quarter earnings estimate of 94 cents to 96 cents a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bayer jumped 4.16, or 37%, to 15.40 after a jury in Corpus Christi, Texas, cleared the German drug company of any liability in a $560 million lawsuit accusing the company of ignoring reports that linked its Baycol anticholesterol drug to various deaths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Williams-Sonoma shed $1, or 4.5%, to 21.20 after the specialty retailer said it expects first-quarter earnings of seven cents or eight cents a share, sharply lower than analysts' expectations of 15 cents, on revenue of $529 million to $547 million. The average revenue estimate among analysts was $536.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goodyear Tire gained 17 cents to 4.24, helping to fuel strength in the tire sector. The company said it will record a noncash fourth-quarter charge of $1.1 billion, or $6.17 a share, to comply with an accounting rule governing its deferred tax assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebecor fell 5.26, or 24%, to 16.74 after the Montreal printing company announced the surprise resignation of Michel Desbiens, who was named president and chief executive last month, and said first-quarter earnings will come in lower than those a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BASF gained 3.90, or 12%, to 37.60 after the German chemicals company said 2002 earnings rose 25%, beating analysts' expectations due to cost cutting. BASF said it expects earnings growth to continue into the first quarter of 2003. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Patrick Barta </div><div>574 words</div><div>19 March 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts plummeted last month, as cold weather and mounting war worries put a damper on new-home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said housing starts in February fell 11% from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.622 million units, the lowest level of construction since last April. The decline was the largest drop in percentage terms since January 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing permits, an indicator of future building activity, rose a modest 0.4%, but that gain was the result of an unexpected 37.9% rise in apartment-building permits, which are highly volatile. Permits for single-family homes, a much larger slice of the housing market, fell 6.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and homebuilders blamed much of the weakness on winter storms, which blanketed parts of the country last month, putting many construction plans on hold. "There were about six weeks of nobody being able to dig" to start new homes, says Brad Elliott, president of Elliott Building Group, a home builder in southeastern Pennsylvania. But the declines also showed up in parts of the nation that weren't as significantly affected by weather, including the West Coast, where single-family housing starts fell 14.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, other recent indicators have suggested a broader softening in the market that goes beyond bad weather. Although housing activity remains very strong by historical standards, applications for home-purchase mortgages have drifted downward in recent months, and sales of new homes fell a surprising 15.1% in January. Earlier this week, the National Association of Home Builders said its monthly index of builder sentiment dropped a sizable 10 points this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Seiders, chief economist at the builders association, said some builders who were surveyed for the index said buyers were still coming out to view model homes, but were postponing decisions to buy because of worries about the job market and the situation with Iraq. Other responses to the survey suggested that advertising wasn't helping create sales in some communities. Indeed, Mr. Seiders said as much as half of February's decline in starts was the result of builders responding to "a weakening of home buyer demand, despite the incredibly great interest rates" that have stimulated the market for some time. Other economists questioned whether low interest rates would be enough to offset weak consumer confidence in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pent-up demand [for housing] is not as great as it was a year ago," said Christine Chmura of Chmura Economics &amp;Analytics in Richmond, Va. Even so, economists say they still don't foresee a major decline in housing, and some said it is possible the market could even get a short-term boost if the Iraq situation is resolved quickly. There were similar ominous signs in the weeks following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, but builders were able to maintain sales by offering incentives to buyers, including free amenities for new homes. There also was a large decline in housing starts during the Gulf War in the early 1990s, but starts began to recover within a few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a regional basis, starts fell by 19% in the Midwest, 9.4% in the South and 11.1% in the West. Starts were flat overall in the Northeast, though single-family starts in that region fell by 8.9%. </p>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 10.72 points at 8152.64 in

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing starts  fell  11% last month, according to the U.S. Commerce
Department, a much bigger drop than the 7% economists had forecast.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists blamed part of the dropoff on huge winter storms in the
Northeast that prevented construction. However, they also warned that
mortgage rates are poised to begin to rise, which will put a longer-term
crimp on the housing market, which helped keep the economy growing last
year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, the surprisingly weak economic data had many traders looking
ahead to the scheduled meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee
later in the day. Most economists expect the Federal Reserve to leave
interest rates at 1.25%, but shift to a weakening "bias" statement.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Stock prices soared in the U.S. and overseas Monday as the U.S.
signaled that a U.S.-led war in Iraq is only days away. President George

3.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index jumped nearly 3.9%.

U.S. housing starts plummeted in February, as cold weather and

starts was due to builders picking up signals of "a weakening of home
buyer demand, despite the incredibly great interest rates" that have
stimulated the market for some time.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, many economists -- including Mr. Seiders -- warned against
viewing the latest housing data as an indication that the housing market
is poised for a major decline. There were similarly ominous signs in the
weeks following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, but builders were
able to ride out the temporary drop in consumer confidence by offering
incentives to buyers, including free amenities for new homes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On a regional basis, starts fell by 19% in the Midwest, 9.4% in the
South and 11.1% in the West. They were flat in the Northeast, though
single-family starts in that region fell by 8.9%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, the Empire State Manufacturing index contracted in early
March for the first time since October, another indicator that the
economy is slowing as the U.S. prepares for war.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The index is produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and
measures general business conditions for manufacturers in New York
state, the U.S.'s second-largest state economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Empire State's general conditions index fell to minus 2.5 in
March, compared with 1.1 in February and 20.7 in January. The new-orders
index fell sharply to minus 6.88 from 12.27 in February. The employment
index also dropped sharply to minus 17.25 from 0.12 in February.
Readings below zero denote contraction in the sector.

Manufacturing Growth
In U.S. Slows for Month

Consumer Spending Falls,
But Construction Activity
Climbs to a Record High

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. factory sector in February eked out a
fourth-straight month of growth, but the pace of expansion slowed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other reports showed U.S. consumers trimmed their spending during
January even though their incomes climbed, while the nation's spending
on construction projects surged to a record in the month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report on manufacturing -- the U.S. economy's hardest-hit sector
-- drew the most attention. The Institute for Supply Management said its
February index of manufacturing business activity fell to 50.5 from
January's 53.9. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in
manufacturing activity. The December index was 55.2 and November's was
50.5.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists had expected the index to fall to 52 for February, as other
reports have pointed to growth that is considerably softer than many had
forecast.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"While production remained strong, there was a significant slowing in
the rate of growth of new orders," said the ISM's Norbert J. Ore, who
directs the survey for the private-industry group. Manufacturing jobs
continue to decline at an accelerated pace, he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The ISM's February index of new orders dropped to 52.3 from 59.7 for
January, while the production index fell to 55.4 from 56.3. The index
tracking employment in manufacturing dropped to 42.8 from 47.6.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Faced with rising energy and commodity prices, the purchasing managers
who responded to the ISM survey indicated price pressures remain a
concern. The group's February price index jumped to 65.5 from 57.5 for
January.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a separate report, the U.S. Commerce Department said January
consumer spending fell 0.1%, the first drop since September. Personal
incomes, meanwhile, rose 0.3%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The downturn in spending may be a disturbing sign for an economy that
is advancing fitfully. But the decline was somewhat expected after
Americans splurged in December, finding end-of-year financing deals on
cars and other big-ticket items too good to pass up. Spending for
December was revised to a 1% jump from the previously estimated 0.9%
gain.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Retailers of big, costly items meant to last at least three years took
the biggest hit. January spending on durable goods skidded 5.7%, the
largest drop since a 6% tumble 13 years ago. It was a clear sign
consumers ran out of gas after spending on durable goods in December
surged 6.8%. Spending on nondurable goods, such as food and clothes,
rose 1.3% in January.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumers, whose spending accounts for two-thirds of economic
activity, have been one of the few pillars of the U.S. economy. Worries
about a possible war with Iraq, roller-coaster stocks and a sluggish job
market may be taking their toll; several reports recently have shown
waning consumer confidence in the economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Commerce also reported total spending on new construction projects
during January grew at a 1.7% annual rate to a seasonally adjusted
$877.9 billion. The all-time monthly high was powered by record
home-building, as builders bet that low mortgage rates would continue to
support the market.

</p><div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Manufacturing Lost Momentum During February</span>
</div><div class="author">By Patrick Barta </div><div>775 words</div><div>4 March 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budding manufacturing revival that began just a few months ago appears to be slipping away, an indication that the uncertainty of a possible war with Iraq is weighing heavily on the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity dropped to 50.5 in February from 53.9 in January. Although economists took note that the index remained above 50 for the fourth consecutive month -- a reading above 50 indicates that manufacturing activity is expanding while a reading below 50 denotes contraction -- the trend clearly points to a significant loss of momentum from December, when the index registered 55.2. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked whether February's drop represented a temporary blip or a reversion back to the slower manufacturing activity of last year, the ISM survey chairman, Norbert Ore, said he suspected the latter. He said survey respondents expressed concern about rising energy costs, as well as uncertainty related to the possibility of war with Iraq. Companies "just don't know what to do, so they're doing nothing," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps most troubling, said economists, is that the report's employment index fell to its lowest level in more than a year, dropping to 42.8 from 47.6 in January, indicating further contraction. Steve Wood, an economist at Insight Economics LLC in Danville, Calif., said the decline in the employment index "bodes ill for the manufacturing component of Friday's payroll employment report. Factories are simply not hiring." The Friday payroll report, to be released by the Labor Department, will provide the latest reading on employment and unemployment for the month of February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several other economic reports released yesterday also pointed to weakness. The Commerce Department said personal income in the U.S. rose 0.3% in January, following a revised 0.3% gain in December. But the gain was due mainly to rising public-sector wages and to transfer payments. For example, federal employees received annual pay raises in January that totaled $5.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was also a 1.4% cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security recipients that pushed payments higher. Wages in the private sector, on the other hand, fell for the first time since July 2002, an indication that continued layoffs are leaving workers with little leverage to demand pay increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal spending, meanwhile, fell 0.1%. That drop was led by a 5.7% decline in sales of durable goods, including automobiles, whose sales were expected to fall as the impact of new financing incentives launched in December wore off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on nondurable goods, however, was strong, rising 1.3%. Mr. Wood said the latest spending data suggested consumers are still willing to open their wallets when they think they are getting a great deal, as with the latest round of auto-financing incentives and new-home purchases. But even that willingness could ebb, he says, if private-sector wages don't start to grow again. Given the continued high level of layoffs, "it's going to be really hard to get any lift on the wages and salary side," he said. "That's worrisome because that ultimately is where all our spending power comes from."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another threat to spending comes from weaker home-price appreciation. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said yesterday that home prices rose at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the fourth quarter -- the weakest quarterly appreciation in more than five years -- compared with an upwardly revised 5.85% during the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, home prices rose 6.89%, but the rate of appreciation slowed significantly in the second half of the year, the housing office said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one bright spot, construction spending shot up 1.7% in January, the Commerce Department said. The gain was led by a 2.5% increase in residential construction, as low interest rates and strong home sales have pushed housing starts to their highest levels since the mid-1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government construction rose 1%. Commercial construction fell 0.3%. Office vacancies remain high around the country, implying that construction of new office buildings won't pick up anytime soon. </p>

Drop in New-Home Sales
And Rise in Jobless Claims
Signal Short-Lived Bounce

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Business spending on new capital goods jumped  in
January, further evidence that the economy began pulling out of its
late-2002 slump as the new year began. But a drop in new-home sales in
January and a rise in initial claims for unemployment insurance
suggested the bounce could be short-lived.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders for durable goods, or items meant to last three years or
longer, rose 3.3% in January from December after falling 0.4% in
December, the Commerce Department said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Though orders are volatile, the report contained some encouraging
news: Capital-goods orders excluding defense and aircraft, an important
indicator of businesses spending, increased 5.4% to the highest monthly
level since mid-2001. Business investment has been the economy's weak
spot for more than two years. It has been restrained by excess capacity,
weak corporate balance sheets and now worries about war and high energy
prices.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The January report suggests investment in equipment (though not
buildings) is slowly rising, perhaps because companies can no longer
make do with high-tech gear that is rapidly turning obsolete. Computer
shipments, which are less volatile than orders, rose 6% to the highest
level in a year. Shipments of communications equipment,  hit by the
telecommunications industry's woes, leapt 23%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the rebound in industrial activity may not last. It may reflect
restocking of low inventories rather than fresh demand.
Regional-manufacturing indicators suggest activity tailed off in
February. Furthermore, statistical quirks tend to make orders appear
stronger at the start of the quarter than they actually are.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Federal Reserve governor Susan Bies said after a speech Thursday, "The
economy has gotten most of the soft spot behind us," but added that
until the "geopolitical situation . . . is resolved, we're not going to
see much of a different pace of economic growth than we've been seeing
on average over the past year."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other reports also suggest the economy is still struggling. The number
of workers filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits rose
11,000 last week to a two-month high of 417,000, the Labor Department
said, despite a snowstorm that likely forced some people to postpone
claims.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The less-volatile four-week average rose 4,000 to a seven-week high of
399,750. Other reports confirm the weak state of the labor market.
Earlier this week, a survey by temporary-staffing agency Manpower Inc.
said just 11% of employers planned to increase hiring in the second
quarter, down from 16% in the first quarter. The figures are seasonally
adjusted.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Labor Department said the number of workers drawing unemployment
benefits for more than a week declined in the week ended Feb. 15, the
latest period for which the number is available. Continuing claims fell
by 45,000 to 3,377,000 in that week. The unemployment rate for workers
with unemployment insurance held steady at 2.7%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, the Commerce Department reported that sales of new,
single-family homes plummeted 15.1% in January, to an annual rate of
941,000, a possible sign the red-hot housing market is cooling. The
percentage drop, the largest in nine years, likely overstates the trend.
Sales had risen 4% in December to a record, and January sales were
likely hurt by cold weather in the Midwest, Morgan Stanley economists
said.

WASHINGTON -- Sales of new, single-family homes in the U.S. plummeted
in January, possibly marking the beginning of a slowdown in the red-hot
housing market, a government report said Thursday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

higher, but showed that the nation's labor market is stagnating.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
New-home sales fell 15.1% in January to a seasonally-adjusted annual
rate of 941,000, marking the largest monthly percentage drop in nine
years, the U.S. Commerce Department said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report was much weaker than Wall Street's expectations. A Dow
Jones Newswires-CNBC survey of economists estimated home sales would
fall 3.4% to a 1.045 million annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the decline followed a record-setting month in December. December
new home sales were revised to a 4.1% rise to a 1.077 million annual
rate. December new-home sales were previously reported as a 3.5%
increase to a then-record 1.082 million rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new-home sales data conflicts with data on existing-home sales
released earlier this week that showed existing sales reached a record
high in January. Despite the new-home sales drop, sales remain at a
fairly high level.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
January new-home sales were pulled down by a record 42.2% plunge in
the Midwest, a 12.9% drop in the South and a 1.4% decline in the West.
Sales in the Northeast, however, increased 43.5%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The inventory of homes on the market rose to a more than two-year high
of 4.5 months' supply in January from 3.8 months' supply in December.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The median price for a new home, the midpoint of all prices, fell to
$182,300 in January from $192,300 in December. The average price for a
new home also fell in January to $228,600 from $234,600 in December.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
An estimated 70,000 homes were actually sold in January, based on
figures that aren't seasonally adjusted.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, orders for durable goods, or items meant to last three
years or longer, rose by 3.3% to $174.78 billion in January following a
downward revision to December orders, the Commerce Department said.
December orders were revised to a 0.4% decline after previously being
estimated as a 0.2% drop.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Initial jobless claims rose unexpectedly in the week ended Feb. 22,
climbing by 11,000 to 417,000, the U.S. Labor Department said Thursday.
That marked the second consecutive weekly gain, and it raised the
four-week average by 4,000 to a seven-week high of 399,750.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Labor Department said the number of workers drawing unemployment
benefits for more than a week declined in the week that ended Feb. 15,
the latest period for which the number is available. Continuing claims
fell by 45,000 to 3,377,000 in that week. The unemployment rate for
workers with unemployment insurance held steady at 2.7%.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In yet another report, the Conference Board reported that its
help-wanted advertising index rose to 40 points in January from 39 in
December. It was at 47 points a year ago.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report said that in the last three months, help-wanted advertising
has increased in five out of nine U.S. regions, led by a 20.1% increase
in the Rocky Mountain region, a 12% gain in the Southern Atlantic Zone
and an 8.7% rise in New England.

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip </div><div>793 words</div><div>28 February 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Business spending on new capital goods jumped sharply in January, further evidence that the economy began pulling out of its late-2002 slump as the new year began. But a drop in new-home sales in January and a jump in initial claims for unemployment insurance suggested the bounce could be short-lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods, or items meant to last three years or longer, rose by 3.3% in January from December after falling 0.4% in December, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though orders are volatile, the report contained some encouraging news: Capital-goods orders excluding defense and aircraft, a key indicator of business spending, jumped 5.4% to the highest monthly level since mid-2001. Business investment, the economy's weak spot for more than two years, has been restrained by excess capacity, weak corporate balance sheets, and now worries about war and high energy prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The January report suggests that investment in equipment (though not buildings) is slowly rising, perhaps because companies must replace obsolete high-tech gear. Computer shipments, which are less volatile than orders, rose 6% to the highest level in a year. Shipments of communications equipment, hard hit by the telecommunications industry's woes, leapt 23%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rebound in industrial activity might merely reflect restocking of low inventories rather than fresh demand. Regional manufacturing indicators suggest activity tailed off in February, and statistical quirks tend to make orders appear stronger at the start of the quarter than they actually are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Governor Susan Bies said after a speech yesterday, "The economy has gotten most of the soft spot behind us," but added that until the "geopolitical situation . . . is resolved, we're not going to see much of a different pace of economic growth than we've been seeing on average over the past year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The manufacturing industry is making clear progress in early 2003, after a disappointing setback in the final months of 2002," said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a public policy and business research organization in Arlington, Va. "However, the economic recovery will not be on firm footing until business leaders are confident enough . . . to grow business spending."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reports released yesterday also suggest the economy is still struggling. The number of workers filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits rose 11,000 last week to a two-month high of 417,000, the Labor Department said, despite a snowstorm that likely forced some people to postpone filing claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The less-volatile four-week average rose 4,000 to a seven-week high of 399,750. Other reports confirm the weak state of the labor market. This week, a survey by temporary staffing agency Manpower Inc. said just 11% of employers planned to increase hiring in the second quarter, down from 16% in the first quarter. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department reported that sales of new, single-family homes plummeted 15.1% in January, to an annual rate of 941,000, a possible sign the red-hot housing market is cooling. The percentage drop, the largest in nine years, likely overstates the trend. Sales had risen 4% in December to a record level, and January sales were likely hurt by cold weather in the Midwest, Morgan Stanley economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With mortgage rates at record lows, individuals seeking alternative investments to stocks, and new homes being built at roughly the same rate new households are being formed, demand for new homes will probably remain firm. Indeed, existing-home sales reached a record high in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market will be hard-pressed to hang on to the record levels reached in the past year. The inventory of new homes on the market rose to a more than two-year high of 4.5 months' supply in January from 3.8 months' supply in December. The median price for a new home, the midpoint of all prices, fell to $182,300 in January from $192,300 in December.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes were strong again in January, in terms of both price and numbers of homes sold. The big jump in prices in the Northeast was due in part to a tight inventory of homes. Prices are still climbing at a double-digit pace in the West, though appreciation appears to have slowed a bit lately in the Midwest and the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only region where the seasonally adjusted annual rate of homes sold fell was the Midwest, but the decline followed a sharp increase in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For consumers, low interest rates mean it may still be a good time to buy a house. But the high prices suggest there won't be many bargains soon. </p>

U.S. Consumer Confidence Falls

Despite Rise in Home Sales,
Fears of Drop in Spending
Persist Among Economists
</span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Soaring energy costs, the prospect of war with Iraq and terrorism
alerts all combined to send U.S. consumers' confidence in the economy
plunging to its lowest level in a decade.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The drop in the U.S. Conference Board's index of consumer confidence
to 64 in February from a revised 78.8 in January -- below levels
recorded in the 2001 recession, even after the terrorist attacks that
autumn -- illustrates how seriously so-called geopolitical risks are
hampering an already tenuous economic recovery.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Lackluster job and financial markets, rising fuel costs, and the
increasing threat of war and terrorism, appear to have taken a toll on
consumers," said Conference Board economist Lynn Franco. "This month's
confidence readings paint a gloomy picture of current economic
conditions, with no apparent rebound on the short-term horizon."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists and policy makers have long-debated whether consumer
confidence surveys predict what consumers do, or simply follow
established economic trends. That confidence fell in February against a
backdrop of political tensions, falling stock prices and still
lackluster growth isn't surprising. But the drop was so large that it
raises the risk that consumers' fear could push down consumer spending
further than other financial and economic factors would suggest.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But so far there is scant sign of that. Sales of existing homes surged
in January to a record annual rate of 6.09 million, the National
Association of Realtors said Tuesday, up 3% from December's 5.91 million
annual pace, itself revised up from the originally reported at a 5.86
million annual rate. A decline in mortgage applications to purchase new
homes in February from January suggests some pullback, but the market is
apt to remain healthy given that mortgage rates are again scraping
generation-lows.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The inventory of homes on the market rose to 4.5 months supply in
January from December's revised 4.3 months, the NAR said. The median
home price decreased to $160,400 in January, compared with a revised
$162,400 in December.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The economy continues to struggle. Housing continues to be strong,"
said NAR Chief Economist David Lereah.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, U.S. retail sales have been walloped in February because of
snowstorms. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UBS Warburg, in a joint
release, said chain store sales tumbled 0.8% last week from the prior
week and are down 1.9% from a year earlier. "Sales improved by
mid-to-late week, but that improvement was too little and too late to
offset the poor sales performance for the Presidents' Day holiday and
ultimately for the week," the banks said in their report.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Conference Board said that its present-situation index, a gauge of
consumers' assessment of current economic conditions, fell to 61.6 from
a revised 75.3 the prior month. The group described consumers'
assessment of the current economic environment as "bleak," and said that
those who see conditions as bad rose to 30.7%, from 26.7% the month
before.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, consumer expectations for the state of economic activity
over the next six months plummeted to 65.6 in February from a revised
81.1 in January. The Conference Board consumer-confidence survey is
based on a mail-in survey of 5,000 respondents.

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton </div><div>771 words</div><div>11 February 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts soared to 1.7 million last year, the highest level in 16 years. At the same time, lumber prices dropped to a 10-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's going on here?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. lumber industry is laboring under a glut of supply brought on by a number of factors -- the most prominent of which is partly of the industry's own making. A controversial tariff that U.S. officials slapped on Canadian lumber imports last year, at the urging of many U.S. producers, has had the paradoxical impact of increasing those imports. That increased flow from the North is being compounded as timber producers from Europe and other overseas markets have raced into the U.S. to take advantage of the weakened dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. lumber companies were already struggling with a multiyear slump in paper and pulp prices, brought on by the weak economy. Now they have additional woes as the current oversupply of lumber has further depressed prices, preventing them from benefiting appreciably from the strong housing market, one of the economy's few bright spots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Timber company stock prices reflect the tough times. The Dow Jones Total Market U.S. Forest and Paper Products Index has fallen 22% since last May, when the tariff on Canadian imports was imposed by the U.S. Commerce Department. The index reflects weakness in both lumber and paper markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Georgia-Pacific Corp., a big lumber producer in Atlanta, recently reported a widened loss for the fourth quarter, citing "challenging conditions" in its building-products businesses. Spokane, Wash.-based Potlatch Corp. told a similar tale when it reported results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potlatch was among a number of companies that banded together to push for the Canadian lumber tax, which averages 27%. The group said it was seeking to level the playing field between producers on both sides of the border. Trade experts say the Americans felt disadvantaged because the Canadians get their timber off government-owned forests where costs for the trees often aren't as high as on the mostly private timberlands in the U.S. Canadian manufacturers have denied an unfair advantage, citing greater plant efficiencies for any lower costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But almost as soon as the tax took effect May 22, the U.S. producers say they realized the move was a mistake. Although exports to the U.S. dropped from eastern Canada, they shot up in the West, where mills increased production to lower plant-operations costs. British Columbia exports rose 2% from already record levels after the tariff was imposed, Canadian forestry officials say. The tariff applies to all Canadian mills, some of which are owned by U.S. companies, including Weyerhaeuser Co., but most of which are in Canadian hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The mills had to produce more to lower their unit cost," says Carl Grenier, executive vice president of the Free Trade Lumber Council, an association of Canadian producers. "This tactic of the U.S. group actually backfired on them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. producers agree the tax hasn't worked and say they are working with the Canadians to get the tariff dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compounding the lumber glut was the weak dollar, which attracted more imports. Europe's timber industry in particular, facing its own building-market slump, set its sights on the U.S. in a big way last year, American manufacturers say. German lumber manufacturers more than doubled their exports to the U.S. in 2002 from a year earlier, according to the Western Wood Products Association, an industry trade group in Portland, Ore. Overall, lumber imports rose to 39% of the estimated 54.3 billion board feet sold in the U.S. last year from 36% in 2000, according to the association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. companies are scrambling to cope. Louisiana-Pacific Corp. last year embarked on a restructuring program to shed traditional lines such as plywood to focus on more profitable businesses, such as manufacturing composite wood. The Portland, Ore., company has sold three of its 12 mills, shed 2,000 of its 10,000 jobs and is in the process of selling all 935,000 acres of its timberlands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies are faring better, despite the lumber glut. Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek Timber Co. attributed their profits in the fourth quarter to their respective diversification strategies. Weyerhaeuser recently expanded its mix of mills by buying up rival Willamette Industries Inc. Plum Creek has a thriving real-estate business and timber holdings from coast to coast. </p>
