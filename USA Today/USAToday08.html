<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A grim report Thursday on sales of existing homes in June signaled that the housing crisis is deepening, with some analysts saying the slump could last into 2010 despite congressional efforts to boost sales and stem foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report helped topple stock prices on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones industrial average sinking 283 points, or 2.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell 2.6% from May to June -- roughly twice as much as expected -- to a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.86 million, the National Association of Realtors reported. That was 15.5% below the level for June 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for June declined to $215,100, down a sharp 6.1% from a year ago. And with an 11-month supply of homes now on the market, prices will remain under pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Foreclosures and short sales are likely to continue rising, but this is probably the bottom in sales, right about now," says Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. Still, Zandi says, "It's reasonable that the market will stay soft until 2010."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress has raised some hopes for a recovery, with final passage nearing of a bill that's intended to help hundreds of thousands of people avoid foreclosure. But for now, deepening worries about the economy -- amid rising mortgage rates, layoffs and inflation -- are plaguing real estate and forestalling any recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can't believe it will happen before 2009, and it may take until 2010," says Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. "The bailout is not going to matter very much. What matters more is the job market and interest rates. You have a lot of people holding off" on buying or selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, says buyers have been put off by uncertainty about the housing market and the broader economy. "It implies the recovery hasn't taken place," he says. "There's a lack of buyer confidence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tighter lending standards, too, have shut out many buyers. Among the other reasons:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*More layoffs. The number of new applications for jobless benefits exceeded 400,000 last week, a higher number than economists had been projecting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Climbing mortgage rates. The average rate on a 30-year fixed- rate mortgage hit 6.63% for the week ended Thursday, its highest in nearly a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Mounting economic anxiety. Higher rates reflect concerns about inflation and the possibility that the Federal Reserve will have to raise short-term interest rates this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising consumer prices -- up 1.1% in June, the fastest rate in 26 years -- are also undermining the housing market and boosting mortgage rates.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pittsburgh, formerly a troubled steel city, has enjoyed better times in recent years. Last year, it was named the best metropolitan city in the country by Places Rated Almanac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is the seat of Allegheny County, which benefits from a fairly robust economy. Since the steel mills were shut down in the 1980s, the area's economic base has evolved. Today, it has medical centers and high-tech companies. It's also the home of several Fortune 1,000 corporations, including <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services</span>, <span class="companylink">H.J. Heinz</span> and <span class="companylink">American Eagle Outfitters.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which explains, in part, why Pittsburgh's housing market has managed to remain steady through the turbulent national mortgage crisis. Though sales are declining, prices are rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices are going up because we have a fairly stable market," says Tony Mete, president of the Realtors Association of Metropolitan Pittsburgh. "Our market was not drastically affected by the subprime fall." Unlike in many other areas, few investors bought homes in the area intending to flip them for a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allegheny County hasn't been totally sheltered from the mortgage mess. Foreclosures have increased in recent years. In the first quarter of the year, 1,187 homes in the Pittsburgh area were in foreclosure, according to RealStats, which tracks real estate in the area. That was 6.9% higher than in the first quarter of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the foreclosures have occurred in low-income neighborhoods; 90% of the homes that ended up in foreclosure from 2000 to 2007 had been sold for less than $100,000, according to a RealStats study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even though we've had a spike in foreclosures, I don't believe that things are as bad here as we read about in other parts of the country," says Daniel Murrer, vice president of RealStats. If they were, Murrer notes, home prices wouldn't be going up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike in, say, Colorado, California and Florida, the Pittsburgh real estate market hasn't seen major peaks and valleys. "We just have a slow and steady market," Murrer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite tougher economic times, downtown Pittsburgh is experiencing a renaissance. Townhouses and lofts have caught on. And downtown living, close to restaurants, shopping and art galleries, is becoming fashionable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's been very little residential building in the downtown area, but it's starting to change," Mete says. "We now have what is like a lower-priced Georgetown, with brick homes in a row, and that is very popular."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historic Charleston has survived the American revolution, the Civil War and the earthquake of 1886. By comparison, the mortgage crisis of the past couple of years is a relative blip in time -- and a lot less painful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have fallen sharply from their highs of 2006 and 2007. But local real estate agents say Charleston, a city of Southern charm and character, is likely to climb back up before long, thanks in part to its relatively robust economy. Last year, <span class="companylink">Google</span> announced that it would build a data center in Berkeley County, which is part of the Charleston metro area. And in 2005, North Charleston became home to Global Aeronautica, which assembles components for <span class="companylink">Boeing.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot of good news in Charleston," says Ralph Wetherell, president-elect of the Charleston Trident Association of Realtors. "And the city, the history, the quaintness and the beaches are big draws."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though sales are down significantly, prices have declined much less severely. One reason is that the metro area hasn't been hit especially hard by subprime loans and foreclosures, which typically drag down prices. "We have pockets of foreclosures but not on a broad level," Wetherell says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately for the area, in addition to its job growth, Charleston is an attractive retirement community. And because the city no longer charges homeowners a school operating tax, property taxes have gone down substantially, something that might help attract more home buyers. "A year ago, my home tax bill was $3,400," Wetherell says. "When I just got my recent bill, it was $1,250."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, sales in Charleston have slowed since banks began imposing stricter conditions on mortgage applications. And the local market remains vulnerable to any severe downturn in the economy. As Wetherell puts it: "Buyers are looking out and saying, 'Should I buy now or sit back and see where my job, the economy and gas prices go?'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, some agents say they're encouraged by positive signs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I see a tremendous increase in showings," says Pam Bishop, an agent at Carolina One Real Estate. "I think people are realizing that maybe the bottom has hit, and so they're making offers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mims Operating Co., a family holding company that owns numerous properties, is selling a home that traces back to 1680. The house, which sits on 39 acres, was rebuilt after a fire in 1892.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if the real estate slump weren't severe enough -- with prices sinking and foreclosures dumping ever more homes on the market -- another threat has emerged: rising mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates helped fuel the housing boom, and rates had remained relatively low even after the boom ended more than two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, with rates creeping back up, the wobbly real estate market could be losing one of its last pillars of support. Some experts say they worry that rising rates threaten to prolong the housing crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage edged up to 6.45% last week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, compared with 5.48% in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For months, the only thing the housing market had going for it was that mortgage rates were low," says Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com. "With them going up to 6.5%, it's like getting kicked when you're down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates are "clearly a negative for the housing market," says Michelle Meyer, an economist at <span class="companylink">Lehman Bros.</span> "It strains affordability, and if mortgage rates were to stay at a high level, home prices would have to fall even farther."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have risen, along with other rates, as inflation has emerged as a growing concern in financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with the Federal Reserve increasingly concerned about inflation, interest rates, including those for home loans, could rise still higher in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the next three months, I'd see rates rising only slightly, because the concern of inflation is already factored in to where they sit today," says Cameron Findlay, chief economist at LendingTree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the next six months, Findlay cautions, rates could rise rapidly. "If we don't have inflation under control by then, and there are still signs of inflation -- the dollar's continuing to be eroded, oil prices are still high -- rates are going to be rising faster."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Findlay and other experts suggest that home prices and credit availability will have more pull in drawing in buyers than mortgage rates will. Historically, he notes, even 7% is a relatively low rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Lanoff of American Success Mortgage in New York says he expects the average 30-year fixed rate to top out at about 6.75%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He warns, though: "If it keeps going up, it would be devastating. It takes prospective buyers out of the marketplace, not to mention people who want to refinance, since the benefit of refinancing ceases to exist if they can't get a lower rate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage application figures seem to bear that out: For the week ended June 20, there were 9.3% fewer applications on a seasonally adjusted basis than there were a week earlier, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported last week. And there were 12.1% fewer refinance applications.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are poised to fall further in coming months, economists said Tuesday after a closely followed index showed that prices sank in the 12 months ended in April at their steepest rate since at least 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of a single-family home in April was 15.3% lower than in April 2007, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index of 20 metro areas indicated. That was the largest year-over-year drop since the index was created eight years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharpest declines were 26.8% in Las Vegas and 26.7% in Miami. For the first time, prices were down in all 20 cities; Charlotte saw its first year-over-year drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collectively, home prices in the 20-city index have fallen to their level back in September 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the beginning of a long and painful bottom," says Mark Zandi, chief economist for <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "I expect prices to decline for another year, but the risks are awfully high that it could be longer than that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The most disconcerting thing about the report is that the price declines are across all 20 markets," Zandi says. "It signals that this is truly a national problem."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Newport, an economist at Global Insight, says, "Even though prices have dropped a lot, they still have a ways to go. My gut forecast is another 20% until it bottoms out. It may take a couple years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zandi says falling prices may mean rising numbers of homeowners owing more than their properties are worth. Any disruption in their income could lead to more delinquencies and foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report contained a sliver of optimism: In most areas, price changes from March to April were less severe than from February to March. Several -- led by Cleveland and Dallas -- even enjoyed price gains from March to April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, overall, the picture was dismal. The Case-Shiller news coincided with a 4.6% drop in home prices reported Tuesday by a separate index. That index, from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), reflects prices of homes throughout the nation, not just in large cities. But unlike the Case-Shiller index, OFHEO's excludes homes bought with "jumbo" loans and those financed by riskier subprime mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices are falling at a rate somewhere between OFHEO's 4.6% and Case-Shiller's 15%," says Newport, who notes that all the gauges have their limitations. "You can't say anything more precise than that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharyn Crown, a broker/associate in Coronado, Calif., who covers the San Diego market, says prices are falling unevenly, with higher- and lower-end homes selling better than those in the middle.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santa Cruz County, situated at the northern part of Monterey Bay, knows how to ride the waves. Legend has it that California surfing began there way back in 1885. Today, the area is coasting through the real estate crisis relatively unscathed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks, in part, to its broad economic base, the county has managed to avoid much of the damage suffered by so many other parts of California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the county's advantages: It's a popular vacation destination; it's home to the University of California, Santa Cruz; and it's the site of several medical facilities. It's also close enough to Silicon Valley that many Santa Cruz residents can commute to work there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing boom, the county was never struck by the frenetic pace of home construction so evident in other areas. "Santa Cruz was proactive in protecting open space," says Christa Shanaman, president of the Santa Cruz Association of Realtors. "We don't have large housing tracts or large developments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, like all parts of the nation, Santa Cruz County has experienced declines in sales and prices at a time when access to mortgages has tightened and the broader economy is sputtering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area has seen some foreclosures and "short sales" -- selling a home for less than the value of the mortgage -- which have hurt the local market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of the slowdown in home sales happened after last August, when the subprime crisis reared its head," says Gary Gangnes, an agent at Real Options Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area's housing market may not have bottomed out, but it might be getting close. Buyers are gradually showing some interest again, the agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are now seeing some excitement in the market," Shanaman says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How low can it go?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in Miami, one of the areas that led the nation's real estate boom, remain in a free fall. So far this year, sales and prices are well below their 2007 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami real estate agents prefer to compare 2008 with 2003, two years before the boom peaked, rather than with 2007. That comparison, they say, provides a better reflection of the current market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we look at 2003, before the huge spurt in sales happened, we would see that the numbers are not far off," says Kimberly Kirschner, chairman of the Realtor Association of Greater Miami and the Beaches. "Are we in a bad market or a good market? That's relative."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, even seen in the most favorable light, the Miami area is still suffering from the rampant speculation that triggered overdevelopment and galloping home prices, followed by a collapse of the mortgage market. What followed was a surge of foreclosures and short sales, in which owners, with a lender's agreement, sell a home for less than the value of the mortgage and thereby avoid foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the sprawling and diverse Miami market, not every area is faring the same. Beachfront sections and neighborhoods near job centers, Kirschner says, are performing better. But in the west side of the metro area, where speculation and overbuilding were feverish, homes are not in much demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've been in this business for 24 years, and I've never seen anything like this," says Juana Gonzalez, president of Northwestern Dade Association of Realtors, which represents mainly blue-collar and midprice areas. "Prices were going up and up and up. Now, the chicken has come home to roost."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unclear, she says, how soon the market will bottom out. But with prices sinking, homes are starting to become more affordable for buyers waiting on the sidelines. Kirschner says she's starting to see more foreign investors coming back into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers are also starting to poke around. In the past few weeks, Gonzalez says, she sold a home in foreclosure to a young couple and a home in an estate sale to another young couple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They couldn't have been able to buy a home if prices had kept on going up," she says. So despite the collapse in the market, "There is a silver lining."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How desperate are some home sellers in this time of sinking prices?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This desperate: Around the country, some homeowners and their agents are now offering shoeshines, bottles of wine and other freebies to anyone who shows up to tour an open house. Used to be, such freebies would sometimes be thrown in for those who bought a home. Now, they're often offered to those who are just browsing. In some cases, the freebies also go to Realtors who tour homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What some are doing:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Charlottesville, Va., Barbara Potter Drinkwater is trying to get other Realtors and potential buyers in to see her open houses. She's tempted them with live music from local artists and drawings for a gas card to pay for the cost of driving to the event. She's also offered each visitor a gallon of ice cream. (The ice cream is to encourage them to drive straight home to their freezer and not visit any competitors' homes along the way.) "You have to price them right to market," she says. "But first, you get them in the door. All my listings have sold."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Free dog biscuits to open-house visitors who bring their pets is just one perk that Craig Anapol, a Realtor with Alain Pinel Realtors in Carmel, Calif., is doing to spark interest. At one of his listings, the seller requests that visitors remove their shoes, so Anapol is arranging to have someone polish visitors' shoes while they tour the house. He's also greeted open-house visitors with hot towels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Tiburon, Calif., agents or even potential buyers who came to an open house Wednesday received a $30 bottle of chardonnay. The home, with a deck, pool and beach access, is listed just shy of $2.5 million. The real estate agency is also considering hiring a three-piece band for another forthcoming open house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In this housing market, volume is really off; there's limited demand," says Mark McLaughlin, a Realtor with Morgan Lane, who is representing the home and gave out the wine. "We had a team meeting and came up with this and said, 'Why not give it a try?' It's a really nice bottle of wine. It's to keep the house in the top of their mind."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*BellTel Lofts, a recently renovated landmark Art Deco building in Brooklyn, N.Y., is using an array of creative tactics to draw visitors. It's offering spa service coupons, and door prizes include aromatherapy candles, lotions and other spa products. In early July, BellTel will also host a cocktail party and offer experts to provide credit analysis for those who attend the open house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ilan Bracha, managing director of Prudential Douglas Elliman, which is handling BellTel, says he and other Realtors are offering such goodies because of how competitive the market has become. "The idea is to try to get the buyers to come in and go against the competition, because of the situation of the market," Bracha says. "It's just to bring them in for the Sunday opens."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyer freebies</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What sellers are offering for free to entice buyers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*$30 bottles of chardonnay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Godiva chocolates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Live guitar music</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jackson displays a small-town atmosphere with Southern charm. And in recent years, it's been insulated from the worst of the national mortgage crisis. "We move at a slower pace," says Becky Tann, an agent at Nix-Tann &amp; Associates. "Since we didn't have any tremendous appreciation, we didn't have a bubble to burst."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have slowed, though not as sharply as in some other parts of the nation. The local market was particularly sluggish from November to February, says John Praytor, president of the Jackson Association of Realtors. But since then, home sales seem to have bottomed out and stabilized, Praytor says, noting that in the first 22 days of May, the median sales price rose by about $4,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He doesn't expect the market to jump back up anytime soon, but "Everything is moving along at an even pace now," Praytor says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tougher lending standards don't seem to be shutting out too many first-time buyers. The majority of sales, which used to involve high- end homes, are now in the somewhat lower $125,000-to-$200,000 range, Praytor says. Many first-time buyers are relying on Federal Housing Administration-insured loans that let buyers put down as little as 3% of the purchase price. Some buyers also receive down-payment aid through the state mortgage finance agency's <span class="companylink">Mississippi Home Corp.</span> program, Praytor says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families who move to Jackson from other cities and states, Tann says, seem to be pleased they did. They're especially delighted, she says, if their home includes a porch where people can gather on a warm day.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are not good times to be selling a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are plummeting -- 14% in the first three months of this year compared with the first quarter of last year, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index of 20 major cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding insult to financial injury, sellers are up against the one constant in all markets: the 5% to 6% sales commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might be a long time before prices rebound. But the outlook is brighter on the commission front, where the Justice Department is chipping away at the walls real estate agents have erected to thwart competition and fix fees. On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors agreed to a settlement designed to guarantee discount brokers full access to "multiple listing services," the databases of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The settlement probably won't drive down commissions immediately. Full-service brokers are entrenched financially and politically. Their lobbyists have pushed through laws and "ethics codes" in many states that ban or limit discounting practices. And the discount brokers still lack the name recognition and resources of the dominant players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But anything that helps to nurture alternatives to full-service brokers can only help consumers. As home prices skyrocketed in recent years, so too did Realtors' incomes, without a lick of additional work. Over time, there is no good reason why discount brokers earning the lower amounts Realtors once collected could not revolutionize the real estate business much as <span class="companylink">Charles Schwab</span>, and more recently E-Trade, remade the stock brokerage business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Internet has dramatically altered industries ranging from travel agents to auction houses. So far, however, the real estate industry has largely resisted its leveling effects. Would-be sellers can accept Realtors' terms or risk a kind of exile in selling directly or working with a new kind of broker ostracized by the full- service community</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multiple listing services have been key in maintaining this status quo. They simplify the business by pooling everything for sale in a given area. Yet they can also be a powerful tool to punish or exclude. Full-service brokers have shared listings with each other but not with discounters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the very definition of collusion. The entrenched players create a common marketplace in which they share a complete set of all listings, while upstart competitors are left with listings that are incomplete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that the industry is just now agreeing to abandon this practice shows how far outside the principles of antitrust law the Realtors have operated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's likely to take a while before discount brokers gain traction and the industry's culture changes. But this settlement represents about the only promising development in an otherwise gloomy market for home sellers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With home prices falling at their fastest pace in at least 20 years, economists warned Tuesday that further declines are likely yet to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices sank 14.1% in the first three months of this year compared with the first quarter of last year, according to S&amp;P/Case- Shiller's national index. That's the sharpest drop in the history of the index, which was created in 1988.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors says he expects prices to continue falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's ugly," Naroff says. "In major metro areas, we had the big (price) run-ups, and that's where we're seeing the record declines. ... Everything is working in the direction of more price declines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economists agree. "We do think prices will drop a lot more," says Patrick Newport of Global Insight. "We forecast another 10% drop from current levels and bottoming out in 2009."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's sending prices tumbling:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Tighter lending standards. Though Fannie Mae and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-chartered mortgage finance giants, are injecting more cash into the marketplace, cautious lenders have made it harder for buyers to get loans. The result: a swelling supply of homes for sale and a smaller pool of qualified buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tight credit is keeping sales down," says Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "Property values are falling, so (banks are) nervous. Prices have fallen so much, and they expect them to fall even more. They're skittish."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Foreclosures. Mounting foreclosures are driving down home values because lenders that have taken over those properties are slashing their asking prices to try to free themselves of the homes. Competing sellers, as a result, must often lower their prices further to attract buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Wary buyers. Many potential home buyers are saddled with a house they must sell first, which can be tough in this weak market. Other would-be buyers, convinced that prices will drop further, have decided it's in their best interest to stay on the sidelines a little longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers don't feel a whole lot of urgency, and that creates a problem," says Ken Baris of Jordan Baris Realtors in West Orange, N.J. "We're seeing many real estate businesses have closed, and many agents have left the business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes, meanwhile, inched up 3.3% in April compared with March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. But the March sales pace was revised sharply downward, and economists say the rising supply of homes will depress new-home sales and prices in months ahead. Sales in April were off 42% from April 2007 -- the steepest such fall since 1981.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P/Case-Shiller also reported that a home-price index it tracks of 20 major cities showed a drop of 14.4% in March compared with March 2007. Among those cities, Las Vegas was the weakest market, with a price drop of 26%. Next worst was Miami, with a 25% plunge, and Phoenix, where prices tumbled 23%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts warn that the slump will likely worsen before the outlook improves, with price declines extending into 2009 and possibly 2010. In large part, the sinking prices are a reflection of how far values had soared during the real estate boom that ended in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We got prices up to levels that were so unaffordable -- the prices needed to fall," Naroff says. "If you'd asked 12 or 18 months ago if they needed to fall, I'd have said nationally 10% and in some areas 20% to 40%, and that's what is happening. That's curative."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zandi adds: "Inventories of unsold homes remain much too high. Prices will have to fall more to raise affordability sufficiently to work off this inventory."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cincinnati, home to Chiquita bananas and <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble</span>, the conglomerate that makes Ivory soap, Folgers coffee and many other household brands, seldom suffers from major economic ups and downs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The benefit of the Cincinnati market always has been that we have a very steady economy," says Karen Schlosser of the Cincinnati Area Board of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area's real estate market may be stumbling now, but "it's not experiencing anywhere near the degree of housing sales and housing price bust that is plaguing so many other parts of the country," says Stuart Hoffman, chief economist of <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services</span>, who studies regional economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Situated along the Ohio River at the Kentucky border, Cincinnati has avoided the devastation that Rust Belt cities have endured from the auto industry slump. Nor was it swept up by the boom-and-bust cycle that stuck Florida and Southern California, Hoffman notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When other parts of the country were having great markets, where housing prices were just going up overnight, we did not," Schlosser says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the long run, that turned out to be good news. Still, Cincinnati has suffered its share of foreclosures, which have dumped more homes on the market and slowed sales, Schlosser says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like cities everywhere, Cincinnati is being squeezed by the economic slowdown, but it hasn't absorbed significant job losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The southern part of Ohio has a much more diversified economy," Hoffman says. "Cincinnati has some real stalwarts, like <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble</span>, which is a pretty steady employer." The metro area also benefits, he says, from a booming aerospace company, GE Aviation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, home buyers are enjoying the biggest benefit. "We have favorable housing prices, we have a wide choice of inventory, and interest rates are low," Schlosser says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices fell broadly in the first quarter of the year, spreading to such cities as Dallas, Seattle and Raleigh, N.C., that had largely weathered the national housing slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of an existing single-family home -- the point at which half cost more and half cost less -- fell in 100 of the 149 metro areas reviewed by the National Association of Realtors, which issued its first-quarter report Tuesday. The median price rose in 48 metro areas and was unchanged in one. The percentage of areas that saw price declines -- 67% -- was the highest since the NAR began such record-keeping in 1979.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the median U.S. home price tumbled 7.7%, from $212,600 in the first quarter of 2007 to $196,300 in the first quarter of this year. That was also the biggest percentage drop on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fall in prices is further evidence of a deep housing recession that has pushed down home sales across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The national housing market shows no sign of a bottom," says Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sales, construction and prices are falling in most places across the country. The worst of the price declines are occurring where speculation, subprime lending and overbuilding were most prevalent. But no corner of the country is immune from the price declines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest drops were seen in the West, where median prices of single-family homes plunged 12.3% from the first quarter of 2007, to $296,300. In the Midwest, prices fell 7.9%, to $142,700.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some price drops were severe, with double-digit percentage declines in such cities as Akron, Ohio, Grand Rapids, Mich., and many cities in California, including the Sacramento area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant price declines occurred largely in urban areas where subprime lending was more common and prices had experienced sharp run-ups during the boom that largely came to a halt in 2006. Though subprime loans -- for people with shaky credit -- account for less than 10% of mortgages, they make up more than half of all foreclosures, the NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subprime loans often impose higher rates, penalties for refinancing and mortgage payments that rise steeply once adjustable- rate loans reset. One in five subprime mortgages is expected to wind up in foreclosure, according to the Center for Responsible Lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those who bought homes years before the slump in many cases are still seeing equity gains. The median rise in value for sellers who bought a home in the first quarter of 2002 is 24%; the median equity accumulation is $37,700.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the drop in prices is causing worries for many homeowners. Some are "upside down" on their mortgage: They owe more than their home is worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you're upside down, you can't refinance, and you can't move," says Deede Wockenfuss, a marketing manager in Gilbert, Ariz., for Assist 2 Sell, which provides real estate services on a fee basis. "People are coming to me and saying, 'Please tell me what to do.'"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Springfield is surrounded by farmland and rolling prairie grass. The gently undulating terrain might also aptly describe the area's real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city, the capital of Illinois, is going through some ups and downs, but it's rolled on through, largely side-stepping the mortgage crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the metro area has been hit by a downturn in home sales this year, it hasn't suffered much from foreclosures or overbuilding. And even though sales have dropped, prices have been rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors have caused sales to stumble this year. For one thing, lending requirements have tightened nationally, requiring more creditworthiness and larger down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's caused a decline in first-time home buyers," says Philip Chiles, president of the Capital Area Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there has been little measurable job growth in the Springfield area, Chiles says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising gas and food prices are also contributing, as they are elsewhere, to consumers' financial strain. "I think people are just running a little scared right now," Chiles says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were also frozen by the cold, icy and rainy weather that lasted through winter and into early spring. But local agents say Springfield should be able to bounce back. For one thing, it's the seat of state government, a stable source of jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"And in the last 25 years, we've had a huge growth in the medical community, which has changed the entire town," says Rita Victor, an agent at Coldwell Banker Devonshire.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improved weather, lower mortgage rates and swelling inventory could now help bring back buyers. More people have been visiting local real estate websites -- a hopeful sign.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, it seemed as though Asheville would manage to escape the national real estate crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market started falling apart every place else, and we were just chugging right along," says Tom Tveidt, director of research at the Asheville Area Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this year -- belatedly but unmistakably -- the housing slump struck the Asheville area. Though home prices haven't fallen drastically, sales have. The primary cause has been a drop-off in out-of-state buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're a destination market," says Terry Horner, president of the Asheville Board of Realtors. "It's a desirable place to live."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several areas of the country, especially in Florida, have served as what Horner describes as feeders for Asheville's real estate. Those areas include retirees who live in Florida part of the year and head north to Asheville to escape the tropical summer heat, he says. Some others who are able to work from home have moved to the Asheville area to enjoy a scenic mountain getaway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after the real estate booms in other states crumbled, they eventually helped dry up Asheville's home sales. In addition, local families have grown more reluctant to buy first homes or to move up to bigger homes because of higher gas prices and economic worries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, unlike in many other areas, Asheville's real estate slowdown hasn't been compounded by huge job losses or waves of foreclosures. Last year, tourism was the No.1 industry, Tveidt says. Among the attractions are the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway and the Biltmore House, the largest privately owned home in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the area has lost many textile and manufacturing jobs over the past 15 years, they've been replaced by others in the health care field, the fastest-growing industry in the Asheville area, Tveidt says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Numerous U.S. housing markets have experienced overbuilding and speculation that fueled sharp price appreciation. That hasn't happened in Asheville. In part because the area is so rocky and mountainous, home developers haven't been able to widely expand into new areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've held our own," Horner says, "and consequently, we've not seen the big depression and dip in prices when the market slowed down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the economy starts to improve in other parts of the country, Horner predicts that home buyers will return to Asheville.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most severe real estate recession in decades appears far from over, with the pace of foreclosures rising, the fall in home prices accelerating and the pain spreading to nearly every major U.S. city, according to two reports issued Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes entering foreclosure jumped more than 100% in the first three months of the year compared with the same quarter in 2007, with one in every 194 homes receiving a foreclosure filing, RealtyTrac reported. Foreclosure activity rose in 46 of the 50 states and in 90 of the 100 largest metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices tumbled 12.7% in February compared with last year, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller composite index of 20 cities. All but one of the 20 cities -- Charlotte -- saw year-over-year price drops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In coming months, more foreclosed homes for sale will likely put further pressure on prices. That's because banks that own those homes must slash prices, forcing home sellers to compete and squeezing sellers who already owe more than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The problems are intensifying, and the price decreases are affecting every part of the country," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, who thinks median prices could easily drop 10% more. "There's no sense of stabilization. The foreclosures are causing a vicious cycle, and the job market is weakening. This doesn't feel therapeutic anymore. This is undermining the economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Sweredoski, a Realtor in Myrtle Beach, S.C., is behind on his own mortgage and facing possible foreclosure. He's also sought bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm a real estate broker, and my business just died," says Sweredoski, 60. "I'm fighting to try and keep it, because I built this house for my wife, as a dream house, for after I'm gone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market can't begin to recover until foreclosure filings start to ebb, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is creating a level of housing decline we've never seen before, and it's not over yet," says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. "This is probably the peak year for foreclosures. Every month, it's more angst. People are giving up and not making any payments at all. I wouldn't be surprised to see things deteriorate further."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one silver lining, Naroff suggests, is that the sooner prices hit bottom, the sooner buyers can step in and begin to revive home sales. "We're beginning to get massive price declines," he says, "and we need that to clear the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some areas are in especially dire shape. In Nevada, with the highest foreclosure rate, one in 54 households received a foreclosure notice in the first quarter -- 3.6 times the national average, according to RealtyTrac. California had the second-highest rate, and Arizona the third.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few areas of the country have been spared from the housing market meltdown, but some cities have managed to avoid the worst of the surge in home foreclosures. Consider Albuquerque.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though home sales are down sharply, foreclosures have been fairly few. This month, Albuquerque was named the sixth-best city in the country in which to buy foreclosed homes, according to Forbes.com. "Its trivial foreclosure rate is enough to offer deals without presenting too many risks," it says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area's outlook remains bright. It continues to generate jobs and attract retirees. The city offers "resort-town ambience, a boomtown economy and cow-town prices," says Kiplinger.com, which named Albuquerque one of the top 10 smart places to live in 2006. Area employers range from film studios to Kirtland Air Force Base. There are also a number of high-tech employers, including <span class="companylink">Intel</span>, Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foreclosures that have occurred are mainly related to overbuilding triggered by real estate investors, says Cathy M. Olson, chairman of the Greater Albuquerque Association of Realtors. But compared with, say, Florida and California, the overbuilding hasn't much derailed home sales, local real estate agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other reasons why sales continue to slip. As is true in some other metro areas recently, when people have moved to Albuquerque, they've sometimes been unable to sell their homes elsewhere. So new arrivals sometimes can't take advantage of Albuquerque's declining home prices, at least for a while, Olson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And at a time when overbuilding has produced a glut of homes for sale, the economic downturn and higher gas prices are squeezing many people's budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Of course buyers are skittish," Olson says. "But it isn't to a point where the sky is falling. Sure, prices are down. But you can get a lot for your money."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sellers, brace for some grim news. The spring home-buying season now underway is widely expected to be the worst since the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many would-be buyers lack strong enough credit to get a mortgage. Home values are sinking. And in front yards around the country, "For Sale" signs are as ubiquitous as garden weeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of an existing home in March was 7.7% less than it was a year ago, the National Association of Realtors reported this week. "Sellers are having to capitulate," says Mark Zandi, chief economist for <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "If you're a seller, it is the worst season since the early 1980s."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, what's bad for sellers is good for buyers -- at least those blessed with excellent credit and enough money for a sizable down payment. They can enjoy lots of homes to choose among, time to browse, and typically, the advantage in negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, whether buyer or seller, anyone engaged in the home- buying process now could probably use a little guidance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sellers: Be realistic</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, Rosemary Johnson is taking a gamble. She and her husband, Robert, 59, own a two-bedroom cabin in Lake Tahoe, Calif., nestled in the pine trees by a golf course. But they've now moved to Los Angeles and no longer need their former home. Despite some trepidations about the floundering housing market, they've decided to sell their cabin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a scary market," says Johnson, 63, an artist whose husband is a builder. "We knew we had to price it very rationally. We had to be realistic, and we're just hoping to break even." Having listed their home at $649,000, the Johnsons spent time sprucing up the yard before putting the cabin on the market. Now, they're hoping for the best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking a realistic view of the market and pricing a home competitively are wise strategies these days. Keep in mind that buyers will typically wield the advantage, so expect to be flexible or even to lower the home price as necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What sellers should consider doing:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Make a stellar presentation. Be sure the house is in near- pristine condition. Looks matter. Fix peeling paint. Make any needed repairs. Consider spending on amenities that attract buyers, such as newer appliances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In order to sell quickly for a good price, homes must be in better condition than the competition and be staged to look appealing from every angle," says Cleve Gaddis, a co-broker/owner of Re/MAX Around Atlanta. "The days of selling by just putting a sign in the yard and listing in the (multiple listing service) are over."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Develop a marketing plan. Figure out how best to display and advertise a home for sale by targeting potential buyers who might be interested. This might include posting the home on websites, sending out mailings to neighbors, holding several open houses and analyzing comparable home sales in the area in the past six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price realistically. Nothing's more essential at a time when buyers expect prices to fall further and are typically in no hurry to close a deal than to price your home realistically. Don't expect to make much of a profit, if any. And try to hit on a price slightly lower than the competition. Lawrence Yun, chief economist with NAR, says prices could fall an additional 10% in some markets. Websites such as ZipRealty.com and Zillow.com allow sellers to get a rough idea of what their home is worth by browsing the estimated values of comparable area homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All sellers today are selling their homes for less than they did a year ago," says Kim Stimpson, owner and broker of Assist-2-Sell, a discount Realty brokerage group in Boise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Offer inducements. Tempt buyers by dangling inducements, such as partial or full seller financing, suggests Pat Lashinsky, CEO of ZipRealty. Be mindful that you're competing for a smaller pool of potential buyers than in years past. Just 13% of respondents say they plan to buy a home within 12 months, according to an April survey of 1,938 participants by Frank N. Magid Associates, a media- oriented research and consulting firm based in Marion, Iowa. An additional 21% said they were unsure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And sellers who are refusing to cut their listing price, betting they'll be able to sell their home once prices bounce back, should keep in mind that few analysts expect a broad recovery anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not going to be a great spring this year," says Orawin Velz of the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers: Do homework</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many would-be buyers, the question is whether now is the time to dive in. Should they wait and buy at even lower prices? In the view of many experts, if a buyer finds an ideal home, with an affordable price and mortgage, there's no reason to wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For buyers, now is a good opportunity to find a good deal and negotiate with sellers," says Lashinsky of ZipRealty. "There're a lot of choices out there. Inventory levels are going up, and home sellers are giving deals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's housing market is radically different, of course, from the one that raged during the housing boom that crested in 2005. Back then, some buyers could purchase a home, then turn around and sell it within weeks, pocketing a profit. Now, with the real estate slump widely expected to persist, prices in many areas are likely to fall further. Today's buyers should expect to hold onto any home they buy for at least a few years before selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What buyers should know:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Negotiate. Sellers, by necessity, have become more flexible about pricing. In some cases, buyers can insist on -- and receive -- perks or discounts such as seller financing and home warranties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carlos Arcos and his partner are in the process of buying a three- story townhouse in Houston for which they were able to negotiate the price. During their search, they found eager sellers throwing in flat-screen TVs and free window treatments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While looking for a new home, many builders were throwing out some great deals to buy new construction," says Arcos, 40, who works in advertising and whose partner, Norman Schack, 45, is a music instructor. "However, my partner and I decided to go with an older home, only 5 years old. Since we were dealing with sellers directly, I think we got a good price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Educate yourself. Thoroughly research prices in the area before making an offer. As home prices fall nationally, some cities are seeing sharper-than-average drops. In other areas, prices remain flat. Some metro areas, such as Charlotte, have actually seen some prices increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We hear about the large price drops in California, Florida," says Leslie Sellers, vice president of The Appraisal Institute. "But it's important to remember that those are the areas that were increasing at the same rates in the upward direction in the past few years. More areas of the country are at a more stable pace, and those have not dropped at those dramatic paces."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone considering buying a home in foreclosure or at auction should do plenty of research. Even then, the process can be difficult and risky. Auctions of homes, for example, often give buyers no chance to do any pre-inspection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Obtain financing ahead of time. Many private banks have sharply tightened lending standards, requiring heftier down payments and sterling credit scores. Even though buyers now have more choices, some desirable homes do receive multiple offers. Some buyers could easily lose out if they're not prepared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who might face the toughest time, Velz says, are those seeking homes in the upper brackets. Banks burned by the rising number of defaults remain leery of offering "jumbo" loans -- those that exceed $417,000 (or, temporarily, up to $729,750 in some high- cost areas).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The worst market now is the jumbo market," Velz says. "It's basically shut down right now."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents are increasingly courting foreigners to buy homes in the USA -- hiring agents fluent in other languages, marketing to foreign buyers and in some cases, offering to pay the airfare and hotel bills of foreign shoppers who buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agents are eager to win the business of foreign investors who are swooping in to buy property in the USA as home prices plummet and the dollar's weak value produces eye-popping deals for international buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the sinking value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, a home bought by a foreigner comes with a discount averaging 30%, the National Association of Realtors estimates. Between April 2006 and April 2007, about 30% of foreign buyers came from Europe, according to an NAR survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly one-third of Realtors reported in that survey having had business with foreign buyers. Activity is especially busy in affluent cities such as New York and in warm-weather vacation destinations such as Miami and San Diego. Many of these investors, Realtors say, are buying homes as vacation retreats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With these prices, you can't say no," says Monique Burger of Belgium, who's buying a Miami Beach vacation condo for $270,000. "With the low dollar against the euro, it helps. And the low housing prices made us want to buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents are seizing the opportunity:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In New York, real estate agent Jacky Teplitzky's firm has staff lawyers who specialize in foreign buyers. Sales to foreigners jumped from 10% of her business to nearly 25% in the past year or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teplitzky says she's seeing a surge in interest, especially from Britain, Italy, Spain and Russia. In April, an Italian buyer in town for Easter took just 48 hours to buy a $3.8 million two-bedroom condo. Teplitzky recently sold $30 million worth of property to Russians who are using the homes as pieds-a-terre.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring home-buying season got off to a feeble start last month, with sales sliding, prices sinking from their level a year ago, and few holding out hope for a turnaround anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing single-family homes and condos dropped 2% in March from February, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More striking, the median price of an existing home sank 7.7% from March 2007 -- the second-steepest year-over-year price drop since the NAR began keeping such records in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a sign that the housing crisis will likely persist well past the spring buying season as consumers await further price drops and financing becomes even tougher to get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with falling home prices, buyers aren't coming forward. One main reason is the credit crisis, says Orawin Velz of the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's the core of why we haven't seen an increase in home sales," she says. "Because of tighter lending standards, you're supposed to have really good credit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales, which fell in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.93 million units, from 5.03 million in February, remain 19% below the level of March last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's year-to-year price drop of 7.7% was second only to the 8.4% plunge in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's decline in prices was a little less than in February, but it's a large decline overall," says Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a sign that some sellers are being more realistic in pricing. But looking ahead for the next few months, sales will be soft."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors are driving the price drops:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Home loans are harder to get. Banks have reined in their lending practices and are demanding heftier down payments and better credit scores, which is making it hard for would-be buyers to get financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright spot: Federal initiatives to bolster the housing market mean government lenders will likely be extending more credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Buyers expect more price drops. Many potential home buyers are watching prices slump, but they're holding off in anticipation of further declines and a better bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sales are close to bottoming," says Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "The problem now, and for the next six months, is that prices are falling, and people don't want to jump in and catch the falling knife."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Rising unemployment. Job losses and uncertainty about the economy are limiting the pool of buyers. The unemployment rate rose from 4.8% in February to 5.1% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sellers complain that even drastic price reductions aren't enough to tantalize buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's depressing," says Anne Berg, a media specialist in New York who has been trying to sell a home in Plantation, Fla., for two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We started the price a couple of years ago at $479,000 and now have lowered it a third time, to just under $300,000. We haven't had any offers. I don't understand why people aren't buying."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, the steepest price drop was in the West, where the median price of $285,100 was nearly 15% lower than in March 2007. Sales in the West rose 2.2% in March but remain 22% below the level of a year ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a chilly night after work last November, Christopher and Jenell Chow relaxed, watching the evening news while their children scampered around their rented two-story stucco home. Someone knocked at the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An officer was standing on the doorstep, eviction papers in hand. That's when the Chows learned that the North Las Vegas home they'd rented for two years was in default. They had 30 days to move out and find a new home for their five children, Jenell's live-in mother, their two black Labs and a cat. The stress was severe: Jenell says she suffered a miscarriage the day before they moved out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We felt dumbfounded," says Jenell, a stay-at-home mom. She and her husband, an electrician, lost their $5,000 rental deposit. "We would have been homeless if someone from our church hadn't loaned us money for a deposit on another place. I believe the stress caused my miscarriage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most brutal real estate slump in decades is reverberating through the rental market. Renters in properties that are being foreclosed on are being evicted. Homeowners forced into foreclosure are becoming tenants again and driving up rents. And renters not yet ready to buy a home -- shut out by stricter lending rules or hoping to buy after prices fall still further -- are creating a dynamic shift: Even as real estate is sputtering, the rental market is surging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents, in fact, are accelerating in many markets across the USA. Vacancy rates are down from last year, and average rent is projected to rise 5.3% in 2008, up from a 3.1% increase in 2007, according to the National Association of Realtors. In some cities, rents are climbing at a double-digit clip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, the median rent rose 14.6%, to $1,810 a month in the first quarter this year compared with a year earlier, according to an analysis by Newton, Mass.-based Investment Instruments. The median rent in Seattle rose 10.3%, to $1,211, in the same period. In Washington, D.C., the median rent rose nearly 5%, to $1,687.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in 2007, the number of renters in professionally managed apartments leapt by the largest amount since 2000, according to the National Multi Housing Council's March report. That increase was as large as the increase for the previous five years combined. From 2004 through 2006, 1.2 million households joined the ranks of renters, more than making up for the loss in renter households sustained from 2002 to 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rental market is now very, very strong," says Allison Atsiknoudas, CEO and co-founder of Investment Instruments, which provides Web-based tools for the real estate industry and tracks rental market rates. "It's stable. The increasing number of foreclosures in the market has definitely increased demand for rentals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other hot rental markets include Salt Lake City, Nashville, Philadelphia and Austin, according to the M/PF YieldStar apartment rankings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High demand, rising rents</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The health of the rental market is critical for several reasons. Rising demand for rentals can spur construction of apartment buildings, a trend that's already occurring in some metro markets. And the need for more rental properties can energize urban development, because higher commuting costs have translated into growing demand for rentals that are near urban employment centers rather than in outlying suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In some areas, because the demand for rentals is happening closer to cities and job markets, there will ultimately be demand for new construction," says Peter Chinloy, a real estate professor at American University's Kogod School of Business. "As rents keep rising, there is more demand, although it also means it's harder to find rental units."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Escalating demand also means steeper rents. The median asking rate for rentals has jumped 14%, from $591 a month during the fourth quarter of 2003 to $673 a month in 2007, according to the Census Bureau. The national vacancy rate for rental housing was 9.6% in the fourth quarter of 2007, down from 10.2% in the fourth quarter of 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors are driving up demand for rentals:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Renters are waiting for home prices to drop. As they watch real estate prices slide, many renters have decided to wait longer to buy because they think prices have yet to hit bottom. Kevin Merrett, 23, of Fullerton, Calif., has adopted a stance of waiting and continuing to rent while keeping his eyes on the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a renter, it doesn't make sense to buy right now," says Merrett, who handles land acquisitions for an apartment developer. "I can easily survive on my low rent. And I've been closely watching the shifts of the real estate market. I'll continue to wait for the prices to come down enough so that even if the market continues to soften, it will not put me in financial trouble" after a home sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Renters are finding it harder to buy. Many renters can't qualify for an affordable mortgage because of stricter lending rules that call for larger down payments and excellent credit. The days of getting a home with no money down or with other unconventional loan structures are gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders have turned more cautious for good reason: Foreclosures are up, and each of them costs lenders an estimated $50,000, on average, in processing fees, liquidation-sale price cuts and other costs, according to the Center for Responsible Lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've seen demand for rental housing go up," says Mark Obrinsky, chief economist at the National Multi Housing Council. "The ownership side is retrenching, and we're seeing the demand going to the rental side. There's a lot of hesitancy to buy. Others can't get (financing), so they're remaining renters longer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*A steep rise in foreclosures. Foreclosure filings -- default notices, auction sale notices and bank repossessions -- were reported on 223,651 U.S. properties during February, a 4% drop from the previous month but still a nearly 60% increase from February 2007. One in every 557 U.S. households received a foreclosure filing during the month, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brannon Cox, 26, and his wife, Sarah, 27, of Flower Mound, Texas, were living in a small starter home they bought in 2004 for $125,000 with no money down; 80% of their loan was a two-year adjustable- rate mortgage. Cox, a graphic designer who then brought home about $2,500 month, soon recognized that his pay wasn't enough to keep up with the escalating mortgage payments. In May 2006, the mortgage rate reset higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the three-bedroom brick home with wood siding and a garage needed major repairs. He and his wife installed new carpet and tile and painted all of the interior. They repaired the garage door. And when the plumbing backed up, Brannon spent hours digging up the rock garden, creating a 6-foot hole, and managed to do the repairs himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His wife, a waitress, lost her job. The air conditioning went out, and in a city with sometimes 115-degree heat in the summer, they had to buy new units with credit cards. Soon, they were $10,000 in debt, and their monthly mortgage bills had ballooned to nearly $1,900 from $1,040. They fell two months behind on the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Facing foreclosure, they had no choice but to sell the house last year for $128,000. And, saddled with new debt, a bankruptcy filing and no savings, they moved into a two-bedroom apartment. Their rent is $1,093 a month -- almost exactly the original amount of their mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Makes you sad'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were scared about what apartment we could get with that credit history," says Brannon Cox, who has a 4-year-old daughter and a second child due in May. "Our daughter says she wants to go back to the old house, and that makes you sad. We still go back to birthday parties with her old friends."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scores of foreclosed homeowners, now stuck with tarnished credit, are finding it harder to get loans as lenders tighten their rules and standards. As more of them become renters, overall demand for rental property rises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's been a big shift, and it's a national trend," says Jeremy Brandt, CEO of 1-800-CashOffer, which connects home sellers with real estate investors. "We're seeing more and more people moving into renting because of foreclosures, and rents are increasing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's especially true in metro areas with stable job markets. Signs of the demand abound, and in some areas, the need for rental units is sparking construction of rental apartment buildings -- a trend that, over time, could help ease rental prices as the supply of apartments rises. In Dallas, apartment construction is underway, including plans for a 15-story building. A 300-unit apartment complex is planned in San Antonio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, rents continue to rise. In the Seattle area, rents rose 2.1% in the first quarter of 2008 over the previous quarter and nearly 9% since the first quarter of 2007. Vacancies in some neighborhoods are at 3%. The average annual rent increase for all units was $84 a month, says Tom Cain of Seattle-based Apartment Insights Washington, an apartment-market-research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rental market is really healthy," Cain says. "Incentives are going away. Renters are not interested in getting into housing, and the number of foreclosures is going up a bit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The withering housing market is also extracting an emotional toll, forcing renters out of their homes as landlords go into foreclosure. No hard data exist on how many homeowners who lose homes to foreclosure are becoming renters. But 18% of foreclosures started in the third quarter of 2007 involved non-owner-occupied homes, according to a study by the Mortgage Bankers Association -- a sign that tenants are hardly immune to the housing meltdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10 days to move out</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tammy Dayton, 46, of Lewisville, Texas, who works in outside sales, had rented a 2,700-square-foot home for about two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day, a sheriff's deputy came to the door, telling her she'd need to leave because the mortgage wasn't being paid. Once the deputy realized she was a renter and not the owner, she was given 10 days to move out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was totally in a bind," Dayton says. "I didn't know what was going on, and I needed to find another arrangement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, she packed her belongings. Along with her Dalmatian, Target, and black Lab, Samson, she moved into a new home to rent. But Dayton says she hasn't received her rental deposit back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was confused and dumbfounded," she says. "I'd paid my rent month to month. I learned to always be prepared for the unexpected. And this time, I checked out the new place first to be sure it wasn't in default."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are sinking. Banks are seizing properties from owners who can't pay their mortgages. Yet for Amber Gilmore, the miserable housing market has never looked better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After searching for a home for more than a year, Gilmore and her fiance found one in foreclosure. Once the bank cut the asking price by more than $100,000, the first-time home buyers eagerly sealed the deal for $230,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In about a month, the couple will move into the two-bedroom house in Chicago with a small fenced yard and garage. The previous owners invested in gleaming granite countertops and hardwood floors. Their loss, Gilmore says, is her gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the best time to buy -- so many homes are in foreclosure," says Gilmore, 25, a news coordinator for Telemundo, a Spanish-language media company. "The market right now is, to us, a benefit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As home sales and prices drop across much of the USA, many potential buyers remain scared to jump into the market, and sellers are resorting to slash-and-burn prices. The national median price sank to $195,900 in February, down from $213,500 in February 2007. Foreclosures are up nearly 60% from March 2007, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To a small but growing number of buyers across the nation, the grim housing recession offers a tantalizing upside: They can get a home at a fire-sale price. In some metro areas, price declines are galvanizing bargain hunters -- especially first-timers, foreign investors and out-of-state buyers looking to rent properties they hope to sell later for a windfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those shoppers are forming isolated pockets of real estate activity, especially in cities where foreclosure rates are high but jobs remain available to attract potential home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some areas, such as Charlotte and Detroit, home sales are ticking upward, following a trend of upward sales as far back as 2006. In other markets, bargain-hunting activity is still too sporadic to fuel an overall rise in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few economists expect the sporadic purchases to signal a bottom to the housing market's slump, but the bottom-fishing for home deals is a hopeful sign amid all the bad news about the troubled housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National housing analysts say they lack hard numbers to quantify the degree to which investors and other bottom-fishers are affecting sales in many markets. However, "We've heard anecdotally that there are some investors looking to pick up these properties," says Paul Bishop, the National Association of Realtors' managing director of research. "That helps put a floor in some of these markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate agents are trying to cash in by buying or renting buses and treating prospective buyers to tours -- complete with free meals -- of foreclosed homes in Las Vegas, Cleveland, Orlando and some parts of Michigan and California. In Auburn, Calif., potential buyers are ferried to bank-owned homes in style -- via a 40-foot stretch limousine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are people looking for deals, and the deals are out there," says Patrick Lashinsky, CEO of ZipRealty. "People aren't priced out of the market anymore. Two years ago, there was a stigma to buying foreclosed homes. Buyers felt like they were taking advantage of someone's bad luck. That's not there anymore."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'I'd almost call it a frenzy'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ruth Ahlbrand, a Realtor in Las Vegas, began noticing new opportunities in the housing market last year, as banks that had seized homes began lowering the prices. In a market where casino projects promise plenty of job opportunities, she knew buyers could be found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So she hatched a plan. Ahlbrand began training her agents to specialize in foreclosures, revamped her Internet marketing campaign to appeal to buyers intent on finding screaming deals and bought a 40-seat bus, which she spruced up with reclining seats and air- conditioning vents for each rider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Feb. 13, Ahlbrand put into service her foreclosure bus -- a red, white and blue coach splashed with slogans such as "Hottest Bank Owned Homes!" to take potential buyers on three-hour tours. The tours include free meals after the ride and an agent with a microphone to point out the deals and explain how to buy a home in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, Ahlbrand says, more than 700 riders have taken the tour, and prospective buyers frequently drop in to see when the next tour is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On weekdays, the bus rides up and down Las Vegas Boulevard, without passengers, to drum up more business. Sales have increased more than 10% since she began using the bus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like a seminar on wheels," Ahlbrand says. "Buyers are saving up to 30% or 50%. People are really looking for a deal. I'd almost call it a frenzy. We've hit the bottom, and Las Vegas is growing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one sign of the trend, she says, more than 40% of the homes her agency sold in December and January were bank-owned at the time of purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Las Vegas is one metro area where prices are dive-bombing. After prices soared during the national real estate boom of 2005, the city has absorbed one of the sharpest drops in home prices in the USA, according to a price-index report from S&amp;P/Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas reported a 19.3% decline in home prices in January, compared with January 2007. And the median home price sank from $314,950 in March of 2006 to $243,169 in March 2008, according to the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While overall home sales are showing their steepest declines in more than a decade, the allure of low prices to bargain-hunters offers a glint of light in an otherwise bleak real estate landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston, Cleveland, Detroit, Sacramento and San Diego have all seen sales increases recently after a period of price declines, according to a March report by Radar Logic, a real estate data and analytics firm. In Detroit, sales of homes and condos rose 12.8% in February compared with a year ago, according to Realcomp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't necessarily mean prices are rising, too: In January, Boston still posted a 3.4% price decline over last year, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A risk-taker's market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Naroff, chief economist with Naroff Economic Advisors, says bargain buyers are moving in but some may be getting into deals in which they are expecting too much bang for their investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the bargain shoppers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Investors. Single-family home prices in 10 major metro areas tumbled 11.4% in January -- the steepest decline since such figures were first collected in 1987 -- according to a March report by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller composite index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One result: mouth-watering opportunities for some investors, some of whom are buying multiple properties with plans to rent them out until the housing market picks up and prices rise again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alison Diboll, a marketing executive in San Francisco, closed a deal in March on the first of four homes she's buying in Charlotte and Dallas. She bought the homes, which were previously in foreclosure and have been rehabilitated, for about $100,000 each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She plans to rent them out for five to seven years and sell them once the market rebounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diboll is so confident that her four homes are a shrewd buy that she hasn't bothered to see any of them and is having them managed by a third party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sort of breezy approach toward buying a home without having seen it firsthand conjures up memories of the risk-taking by buyers during the real estate bubble. But Diboll insists her investment is safer than it would be in the stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the stock market as volatile as it is, it's not a good idea for me," Diboll says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Real estate is the great American Dream," she adds. "I read that the people who made money during the Great Depression were those who had money and took a risk."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Foreign buyers. International investors also are eyeing the U.S. housing market. Thirty-three percent of international buyers from April 2006 through April 2007 were from Europe, according to a 2007 report by the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers from Asia and North America (outside the USA) were also active, accounting for 24% and 23% of international clients during that same time period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales to international buyers have been turbocharged by the steady drop in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the NAR, says the dollar's dwindling value means that foreign buyers can get U.S. real estate at a relative average discount of 30%. (That percentage can run lower or higher depending on the buyer's home country.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents are trying to reach out to some of these far-flung buyers, many of whom are seeking vacation homes. Ralph Haverkate, a broker at Tarbell Realtors in Palm Springs, Calif., is dangling an unusual inducement: Buyers from Canada are reimbursed for their travel and hotel expenses -- up to $1,750 -- if they close on a home. The home doesn't even have to be one that his agency is selling, but they do have to use his firm as their representative. The agency is now offering the same sort of deal for European buyers, initially targeting Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've had buyers flying in back-to-back," Haverkate says. "My partner and I literally have three or four couples a week coming in, and we take care of them. Prices are low, and if you combine that with the currency exchange, the savings are really big. The market is suffering -- but for them, it's good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the international interest is a hopeful sign in today's market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*First-time home buyers. First-time home buyers who found themselves priced out of the real estate market during the frenzied market of 2001 to 2005 are among those who are now tentatively starting to buy properties in some areas where prices have plunged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November 2007, about 39% of purchasers were first-time home buyers, up from 36% in 2006, according to the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who find a price they can afford still face other obstacles in the current economic climate, says Patrick Newport, an economist with Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's still hard to get credit," he says. "Banks are being careful and requiring bigger down payments. But there are people jumping into the market, including investors, who are hoping to make a killing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And buying a home through foreclosure or an auction can be problematic, with properties often sold "as is," or with potential buyers unable to arrange for a full inspection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing needs to be secure, because homes bought at an auction often require closing within 30 days. And some buyers intent on snatching up low-priced bargains they plan to sell quickly could end up being burned if the housing market remains stuck in the doldrums for years to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, foreclosure tours -- some in double-decker buses or swanky limos -- represent part of a trend that analysts say could help prop up the real estate market in some areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you have any interest in real estate at all, you can't ignore the hype about foreclosures," says Nikki Holmes, a Realtor at <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in Auburn, Calif., who has begun conducting Saturday- morning tours in a white stretch limo to showcase foreclosed homes to prospective buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers are getting very savvy and educated," Holmes says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are saying, 'It's a really sad story we have this huge mortgage bust, but it's an opportunity for me.' When something fails, something else comes along to take its place, and that will re-energize the economy."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rochester's housing market doesn't tend to experience the dizzying highs and lows that some other areas have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales and prices rise and fall, of course, but they seldom surge or plunge. Even the credit crisis didn't send the local market into a nosedive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that hardly means the area has sidestepped the mortgage crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are definitely in a slow, soft market," says Holly Creek, a local real estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales are down across the area. "We've been dealing with this for the last several months," says John Antetomaso, president of the Greater Rochester Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic downturn, he says, has led many would-be buyers to sit back and wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures aren't as widespread in Rochester as in some other cities. Still, there were 1,456 foreclosures last year, according to The Housing Council in Rochester. Most of them stemmed from job losses and rising payments on adjustable-rate mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some people bit off more than they could chew," says Rebecca King, director of foreclosure prevention at the council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the mortgage troubles, home prices are still rising. In part, that's because price appreciation in the area never skyrocketed during the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're just a steady-as-you-go kind of place," Antetomaso says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, Rochester has been gradually recovering from the economic meltdown that hit in the 1990s, when its largest private employers, <span class="companylink">Eastman Kodak</span> and Xerox, began to slash their workforces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its peak, <span class="companylink">Kodak</span> employed about 60,000 people in the Rochester area; it now employs fewer than 10,000 full-time local workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been dealing with this for 15 years," Creek says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the major employers today are the University of Rochester and Wegmans food markets. <span class="companylink">Kodak</span> still is one of the top sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today, we have a lot of stability and some great colleges," Antetomaso says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction ran 4/4/2008: The Close to Home feature Tuesday about Gainesville, Fla., should have stated that the University of Florida is the state's second-oldest university. Florida State University is the oldest.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it isn't far from the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, Gainesville is an inland city that never saw the scorching highs and deflating lows that have shaken real estate in the state's sandy coastal cities.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price and sales of existing homes have slipped lately, but some positive signs have recently emerged.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we're heading in the right direction," says Craig McCall, president-elect of the Gainesville Alachua County Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More buyers, McCall says, are beginning to look at properties, and agents are starting to receive more offers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gainesville, which lies in north-central Florida, has escaped the waves of foreclosures that have struck many other U.S. cities. Foreclosure patterns have varied widely in Florida, a report issued last month by the University of Florida Bergstrom Center for Real Estate Studies concluded.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wayne Archer, the center's director, said that most counties in north Florida are in good shape, especially Leon County and Alachua County, of which Gainesville is county seat.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Gainesville as a whole didn't experience the indiscriminate jump in home prices that hit some other parts of the state, a few sections of the metro area saw double-digit price increases, the local retail association says. But overall in recent years, annual price appreciation has generally amounted to a comparatively modest 5% to 7%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've largely been an insulated and stable market," McCall says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gainesville isn't considered a traditional site for vacation homes. Still, it tends to attract young and old alike.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one thing, it's home to the University of Florida, the state's largest and oldest university. It has four hospitals. It offers a range of cultural and recreational resources. And it's relatively close to beaches and championship golf courses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Travel and consumer magazines have sometimes named it one of the most livable cities in the nation. This year, SmartMoney.com picked Gainesville as the No.1 area in which to retire.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive   </p>

</div><div class="author">Stephanie Armour   </div><div>477 words</div><div>27 March 2008</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.3</div><div>English</div><div>© 2008 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales continued their precipitous slide in February, hitting a 13-year low as unsold homes languished on the market because of a scarcity of buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes fell 1.8% in February, according to a report Wednesday by the Commerce Department. The median price of new homes in February -- half sold for more, half for less -- dropped to $244,100, down 2.7% from a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news follows two other reports this week that showed a deepening of the housing crisis that is hobbling the national economy, as well as a potentially grim outlook for the spring housing market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New home sales are dripping down nationally and across all regions," says Patrick Newport, an economist at Global Insight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's still hard to get credit," Newport adds. "Banks are being careful and requiring bigger down payments. Because of that, we don't think the market has picked up and won't until the second half of this year."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in major metropolitan areas plunged 11.4% in January from a year earlier, the steepest decline since such data was first collected in 1987, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller composite index.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And home prices fell 3% in January from December, based on a survey from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northeast saw the biggest decline in new home sales in February from January, a 40% drop, the Commerce Department said. A gain of 5.7% was reported in the South and 0.7% in the West. In the Midwest, new home sales slid 6.4%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's new home sales declined in part because builders have cut back so sharply, so there are fewer new homes coming on the market," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The continued decline in prices, however, could tempt buyers and help shore up the market, says Pat Lashinsky, chief executive of ZipRealty. That, coupled with federal initiatives to ease the housing crisis, may bring some relief.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With stimulus (efforts) and tax returns, people on the sidelines will move in," Lashinsky says. "It's not going to be back to the go- go days, but consumers are interested and they think the market is stabilizing."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications jumped nearly 50% last week as mortgage rates fell after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates and took steps to restore bond market confidence, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some say the turnaround has yet to arrive. Home prices have fallen for months straight, Newport says, but many would-be buyers continue to watch from the sidelines. "They're waiting to see how far prices will drop," Newport says.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices across the USA continued their dizzying free fall, posting record drops in some of the largest metro areas in a sign that no major market is being spared from the national housing crisis.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home prices in 10 major metropolitan areas tumbled 11.4% in January from a year ago {ndash}{ndash} the steepest decline since such data were first collected in 1987, according to the S&amp;P/ Case-Shiller composite index released Tuesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A broader index of 20 cities also showed a similar drop, with prices plunging 10.7%. Markets with the biggest drops were Las Vegas and Miami, where home prices slid by 19.3%. Phoenix fell 18.2%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sagging housing prices are grim news for the economy and sellers. Homeowners are watching equity in their homes evaporate, which could further dampen consumer spending in the first part of 2008. And dwindling home values also make banks shy away from mortgage lending, squeezing out potential buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices are continuing to decline, and that means declining net equity, which causes households to pull back on spending," says Brian Bethune, Global Insight's chief U.S. economist, adding that it will take time to see any benefits from federal stimulus efforts aimed at propping up the beleaguered housing market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the first time both housing indexes have shown double- digit percentage decreases; all 20 cities tracked by the index have seen price drops for five-consecutive months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the declines are becoming more extreme: Thirteen of the 20 cities reported their single largest monthly decline in January.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But deep discounts are also tempting some buyers, especially in markets where home prices are being slashed to bargain-basement deals.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beatrice Flores, 62, a semi-retired secretary in Santa Fe, is searching for a home in Las Vegas because of the price drops there.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The prices are really great, and prices are being lowered," Flores says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other pricing news out Tuesday, home prices fell about 1.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis from December 2007 to January, according to a survey by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. Home prices fell 3% in January from the same month last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The steep declines are a harsh reality check for sellers who are losing money on home sales, says Joel Naroff, head of Naroff Economic Advisors. Home sellers "have to be realistic and realize prices are going down," Naroff says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Seattle, where the latest report showed a 1.3% drop in home prices, publicist Alison Paoli and her husband, Travis, purchased a home after the price dropped from $364,500 to $325,000, plus $10,000 in buyers' allowable costs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Says Alison: "We could finally afford it. The dropping prices made the difference."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales posted their largest increase in a year in February as prices finally fell enough to lure reluctant buyers back into the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes rose 2.9% from January, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. The increase, which was largely unexpected by economists, is a welcome sign of some stabilization in a housing slump that has taken a toll on the nation's economy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price fell to $195,900, down 8.2% from $213,500 in February 2007. The median means half of the homes sold for more, half for less.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices are still very high in a lot of places, and that's holding back sales," says Joel Naroff, head of Naroff Economic Advisors. "I think sales are stabilizing, and that's good news. Housing is not, and will not, be a bright light in the economy ... but the worst is clearly behind us."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, sales of single-family homes, condos and town homes rose to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.03million, although sales were still nearly 24% below February 2007.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some sellers, the price reductions are painful.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My wife and I had to reduce the price of a beautifully remodeled four-bedroom home in Wake Forest, N.C., more than five times before selling," says Larry Schneider, 53, a general contractor who slashed the price by 40%. "It was listed more than a year. And we're talking big drops. We had to practically give it away in order to sell."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market conditions across the USA vary. In Florida, sales of existing single-family homes fell 25% from February 2007, the Florida Association of Realtors said Monday. The median price tumbled 16% from $237,000 to $198,900.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in California, home sales decreased 28.5% in February compared with the same period a year ago, while the median price of an existing home fell 26.2% to $409,240, according to a report Monday by the California Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher sales were reported in areas where marked drops in home prices occurred, including cities such as Sarasota and Fort Myers, Fla., and Sacramento.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sellers are being more realistic in their pricing," says Pat Lashinsky, CEO of ZipRealty.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales are expected to remain on the slow side through 2008, but there are a host of initiatives underway to bolster the sagging market and aid homeowners facing foreclosure, prompting economists to predict higher sales later in 2008. The most recent increase in sales doesn't capture some of those initiatives, such as letting Fannie Mae and  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> buy larger mortgages, making them easier to get.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor that may have helped in February: Orawin Velz, senior director of economic forecasting at the Mortgage Bankers Association, points out that lower interest rates made mortgages more attractive. The national average for a 30-year conventional fixed mortgage was 5.92% in February, vs. 6.29% a year earlier, according to  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac.</span></p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction ran 3/26/2008: A map with the Close to Home story Tuesday about the Boulder, Colo., real estate market erroneously pointed to a location in Wyoming.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the chill in home sales across the nation, Boulder, Colo.'s mortgage market remains warm and healthy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city, nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, shows why there is no national real estate forecast, just as there is no national weather forecast, says Veronica Precella, president of the Boulder Area Realtor Association.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boulder is unlike many cities. Its homeowners are seldom victims of foreclosure because homes have not been extremely overvalued. Almost as soon as a home is available, it's sold, agents say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our sales are very good," Precella says. "There has been some slowdown, but we think that's mostly attributed to people being just a little bit more cautious right now."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existing home sales statistics include the surrounding area. The numbers would be even stronger if they focused only on the city limits of Boulder, which is home to University of Colorado's main campus.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price in the city is $506,500, compared with $347,619 for the Boulder area, Precella says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boulder is more than a university town. The job market is good, and major employers include IBM,  <span class="companylink">Ball Aerospace</span> and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a very desirable place to live, but there's a limited supply of homes because local regulations limit growth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With jobs and the mountains and the sun and the Colorado lifestyle, it always will be a destination place to live," says real estate agent Patrick T. Brown.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Chattanooga hit a slowdown in home sales in January, the city has largely avoided much of the mortgage crisis that has struck many other parts of the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are experiencing a little bit of a correction in the market," says Pam Duffy, president of the Chattanooga Association of Realtors. January, she adds, is typically a sluggish month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As is true elsewhere, the local mortgage market hasn't been able to keep pace with 2006, when home sales hit the highest point in the city's history. Sales have been gradually declining to what experts see as a more realistic level. From December 2006 through December 2007, sales fell by 19%. Even so, 2007 was Chattanooga's third-best year ever for home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures, mainly involving families with little or no savings who were able to buy homes with subprime mortgages, have ticked up, Duffy says. Many of these people had little equity in their homes, if any, and simply walked away, especially after a job loss or a divorce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city was insulated from the worst of the national downturn because it never experienced runaway price appreciation and real estate development in the first place, Chattanooga's MLS President Randy Durham said in a report last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower-price houses are selling more quickly than high-end homes, experts say. People who move to Chattanooga from other parts of the country, especially high-priced areas in California, are finding they can get a lot of house for their money.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction ran 3/10/2008: Home equity is the difference between the market value of a home and the owner's mortgage balance. A story Friday about declining average equity defined it incorrectly.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home equity for the average American has dropped below 50% for the first time since World War II, reflecting a widespread decline in home values and relatively loose mortgage practices during much of this decade.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average homeowners' equity -- the mortgage balance as a proportion of the home's market value -- fell to 47.9% at the end of 2007, the Federal Reserve reported Thursday. The Fed also issued revisions to earlier reports indicating that, for the first time in record keeping dating to 1945, home equity was below 50% for the last nine months of 2007.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop below 50% is partly symbolic: Average home equity was declining even as the last housing boom approached its peak in 2005. But the newly issued number underscores the problems for millions of Americans struggling to hang onto their homes as their mortgage rates adjust upward and their property values decline. It also has broader implications for consumer spending in the USA's sputtering economy, up a paltry rate of 0.6% in the last quarter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the "wealth effect" powered consumer spending across the economy during the housing boom, declining home equity fosters consumer caution.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers are growing more cautious, first, because they are now worth less, and they know it," says Mark Zandi, chief economist for  <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "And secondly, because they can't borrow against their homes as aggressively as they did."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economy.com estimates that by the end of March, 8.8 million homeowners, about 10% of homes, will have mortgage balances that equal or exceed the value of the property. The situation "is only going to get worse," Zandi says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in home equity reflects several factors, including the popularity of low- and no-down-payment mortgages and the surge in home equity lines of credit and cash-out refinancing during the housing boom, says Keith Gumbinger, vice president of rate tracker HSH Associates. That left many homeowners with no cushion when prices started to crumble.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home foreclosures rose to an all-time high in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Thursday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pain of declining equity is hardly uniform across the USA. In established neighborhoods that didn't experience a sharp rise in home values, many homeowners still have home equity of 70% or more, says John Karevoll, real estate analyst at industry tracker  <span class="companylink">DataQuick.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And not all parts of the country have been hammered: In the fourth quarter, the National Association of Realtors reported, prices rose in 73 metro areas, including 11 that saw double-digit gains.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lansing, Mich., had the unfortunate distinction of posting the largest drop in the median home price among 150 metro areas in the last three months of 2007, according to the National Association of Realtors -- down nearly 19%, to $109,600, from the fourth quarter of 2006. Home sales in the area, though, are down by only single digits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's up?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Layoffs in the auto industry throughout the state are the primary reason. Michigan has some of the highest mortgage foreclosure rates in the country. Lenders, stuck with thousands of empty homes, are unloading them at prices "significantly under market value, and that skews the numbers," said Matt Robertson of Century 21 Looking Glass. He adds that many foreclosed homes in the Lansing area are selling for around $50,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the average homeowner who has a house for sale, Robertson says: "It makes it more challenging. You have to have things done to your house to make it more appealing. But buyers need to keep in mind that with foreclosures, they need significant investments; they are not move-in ready."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the state capital, Lansing is blessed with one of the lowest unemployment rates in Michigan. The area also benefits from its hospitals, which are expanding, as is the local Michigan State University.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we didn't have the university, I don't think I would live here," because it adds so much to the community, says Lynne Van Deventer, an agent at CB Hubbell BriarWood-East, who posted record sales last year thanks to an influx of people into Lansing's suburbs.   </p>

</div><div class="author">Noelle Knox   </div><div>490 words</div><div>26 February 2008</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2008 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes slipped in January to their slowest pace in nearly a decade, and prices fell for the fifth consecutive month, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. Yet there were glimmers of hope in the figures.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resales of single-family homes actually rose 0.5% from December - - the first monthly increase in nearly a year, led by a surprising upturn in the Midwest. The median price of a single-family house, meantime, slid 5% from January last year to $198,700, the lowest price since February 2005. That was a sign that more sellers are yielding in the face of a 10-plus-month supply of homes on the market and agreeing to cut prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I expect sales to bottom over the next few months, though prices are likely to continue falling for quite some time," says Joel Naroff, chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pat Lashinsky, CEO of ZipRealty, says, "Sellers seem more willing to negotiate than we've seen in the past six months. That's partially driven by the fact that more homes are sitting on the market for a significant period. There's a sense of frustration among sellers."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nathan Borst and his wife just bought their first home in Alexandria, Va. The seller, with agreement from his lender, sold it for less than the value of the mortgage -- what's called a "short sale" -- to avoid foreclosure. The town home, assessed at $470,000, was listed at $400,000. Borst got it for $390,000. And then the seller chipped in $10,000 for closing costs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While the market may get a bit weaker in terms of prices, we thought we ought to look around," says Borst, 25, a program analyst. "We found one with great value and thought we shouldn't wait around for the bottom of the market."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, sales of single-family houses, condos and town homes fell 0.4% from December to January, to a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.89 million. Sales were down 23% from January last year. For all home types, the median price -- where half cost more, half less -- slid 4.6% from January last year, to $201,100.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, sales in the Midwest rose 3.4% from December to January but were still down 20% from January of last year. Prices were off 4% from last year, to $154,200. In the Northeast, where Boston and some other cities were the first to absorb falling prices, the median price rose about 3% from January last year, to $270,800, though sales were off nearly 26%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worst hit last month was the West, where sales tumbled 28.5%, and prices sank 6.7%, to $300,100. In the South, sales plunged 22%, and prices dropped nearly 6%, to $164,300.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yakima County, Wash., has several claims to fame. It has more fruit trees than any other county in the nation, and it produces more apples, mint, winter pears and hops than any other county, too, according to Yakima County's government website. "Yakima County has surpassed Whatcom County as Washington's leading county for dairy production and cow numbers," it adds.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more striking, perhaps, is that Yakima also enjoyed the second-highest home-price appreciation at the end of last year (after the Cumberland, Md.-W.Va., metro area), up 18% from the fourth quarter 2007, according to the National Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales are down, says Jeannette Biddle, executive officer of the Yakima Association of Realtors. But the median price is rising because more higher-price homes -- meaning those above $500,000 -- are being snapped up by "Seattleites coming over here and investing ... (and) a lot of retirees moving here."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Situated about two hours southeast of Seattle, houses in Yakima remain affordable for many second-home buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of weather, the Yakima Valley enjoys four distinct seasons, and the 233,000 residents see little traffic.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green Bay, Wis., is best known for cheese and the Packers professional football team.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a long time, however, the city and surrounding Brown County have relied on paper mills. Unfortunately, in recent years the paper- products industry has been deteriorating, mostly because of competition from less developed countries. Tattered paper mills, such as Georgia-Pacific, have cut thousands of jobs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over the last three years, it got to a point when it seemed like there would be 50, 60, 100 or 150 job layoffs at various companies," says Mark Olejniczak, a Green Bay real estate broker. "You would pick up the paper and read about it once or twice a month."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green Bay is the largest city in Brown County, which has a population of about 240,000 in 13 townships. The county's largest employer is the business-development corporation of Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although papermaking is still the principal industry in Green Bay, other businesses, including health care, data processing and computer software companies, are growing. And the Oneida Tribe is thriving.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than a year, Brown County Realtors have been dealing with slumping home sales that followed job losses. But the area has largely escaped the subprime mortgage collapse.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with other areas, it has not had a huge number of home foreclosures. In the first nine months of 2007, there were 277 foreclosures in Brown County, up from 240 a year earlier, according to the Green Bay Press-Gazette.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as the market slowed, home builders continued to build houses. That has led to price depreciation. It is now a buyers' market in Green Bay. "We have low interest rates with a great supply at rock-bottom prices," Olejniczak says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers are taking advantage of the low prices, while existing homeowners are finding it hard to sell their properties and move up to bigger homes, brokers say. The upper price range of homes, those over $300,000, is slow to move, Olejniczak says. Sales of homes priced at $70,000 to $150,000 are on the rise, however. While it may take two months to sell them, prices aren't going down.   </p>

</div><div class="author">Noelle Knox   </div><div>626 words</div><div>15 February 2008</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2008 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underscoring the breadth of the real estate recession, sales of existing homes fell in 45 states and Washington, D.C., in the last quarter of 2007, and prices dropped in more than half the metro areas it tracks, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slide in sales is projected to persist through the first half of this year, and prices will likely fall throughout 2008, according to a majority of economists surveyed last month by USA TODAY. The figures reflect job losses in the Rust Belt states, sinking affordability in the Sunshine states and stricter lending rules nationwide.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, home sales fell nearly 21% from October through December, compared with the same period the year before. At the same time, the median price plunged by a record 5.8%, to $206,200.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Dakota was the only state where sales rose -- at an impressive 8.9%. Sales were flat in North Dakota, and no figures were available for Idaho, Indiana and New Hampshire. John Gustafson of the South Dakota Association of Realtors credits that state's strong industrial base, low crime rate and affordable home prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state with the sharpest quarterly sales drop -- a stunning 44% -- was Nevada, which was one of the most overheated markets during the real estate boom. In Las Vegas, the median single-family home dropped about 13% in price. That means thousands of people who bought homes during the past couple of years with little or no money down now owe more than their homes are worth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury condos on the Las Vegas Strip are still faring well, but the single-family home market is "definitely treading water," says Bruce Hiatt, owner of Luxury Realty Group, and he projects it will take up to 18 months to recover.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Bargain hunters are out there, but the foreclosure issue is presenting its challenges," he says. "Buyers are reluctant to buy in neighborhoods that have high foreclosures. They don't want empty houses next to them."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price -- at which point half the homes cost more, half less -- fell in 77 of the metro areas the NAR surveys, with at least 15 areas suffering double-digit drops. They included Sacramento, Jackson, Miss., and the Riverside-San Bernardino area of Southern California.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rich Cosner of  <span class="companylink">Prudential California Realty</span>, which has offices in Riverside, San Bernardino and Orange counties, says foreclosures are driving down prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The lenders have so many foreclosures, they need to get them sold and will take a much lower price than a normal home seller," Cosner explains, adding, "I don't see any change in the market happening in 2008."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all real estate is local, and prices rose in 73 other metro areas, including 11 that enjoyed double-digit gains. Atop the list: the Cumberland area of Maryland and West Virginia, followed by Yakima, Wash., and Binghamton, N.Y.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Explaining buyers' attraction to Cumberland, Melanie Prattdimaio, a local real estate agent, says: "People are relocating here. We have a very low crime rate. We don't have rush-hour traffic."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As more people struggle to pay their mortgage and fewer take out home-equity loans, many homeowners have cut back their spending on remodeling kitchens, replacing windows and other improvement projects.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two out of three homeowners who had planned an improvement project this year said they would wait until the market stabilizes, and about 11% said they were abandoning the idea of a project this year, according to an e-mail survey with 2,100 responses from homeowners in 11 metro areas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey by the Zoomerang research firm, while not a random sample of homeowners, offers anecdotal evidence of the jitters about the housing recession. And it matches industry figures. The remodeling industry, with annual sales of about $280 billion, is expected to see a 2.6% annual rate of decline through autumn, the Joint Center for Housing Studies says.  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> says Americans pulled out only $38 billion in cash from their homes in the fourth quarter last year, about half the amount for that period in 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As property values drop in many areas, some homeowners are finding it harder to refinance their mortgages and take out cash to finish the basement. Falling home prices can also reduce the money that a homeowner stands to recoup on a project.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are telling homeowners who want to sell in the next couple of years to do repairs or improvements to make the house look good, but not to spend a lot of money on a bathroom or kitchen," said Ron Phipps of Phipps Realty in Warwick, R.I.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A swimming pool can cost $50,000 to put in, for example, but it may add only $10,000 to the property's value even in a normal market, Phipps says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, homeowners with access to cash have bargaining power. With construction plunging in many parts of the country, contractors are "hungry right now," Phipps says, and will do remodeling at cut-rate prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower interest rates are also easing the strain on homeowners who can afford a project, says Craig Smith of ServiceMagic.com, which screens remodeling contractors. He says traffic on the site was down in January, especially for big-ticket jobs, but rose about 10% after the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dean Herriges of Urban Herriges &amp; Sons, a Milwaukee remodeling firm, says his business is "a little weaker" than last year "but healthy." He says he's still getting calls from baby boomers who have the money and the home equity for a new kitchen, although even they are asking more questions about prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One trend Herriges sees: "We are not finding as many younger people," who often don't have much home equity or savings.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it's the state capital of Kentucky, Frankfort is a small city. Subtle changes can thus have a big effect on monthly home- sales data.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 9% increase in existing home sales in December -- just three more homes sold than in December 2006 -- could have been a result simply of November's gubernatorial election, which brought in Gov. Steve Beshear, says Judy Craft, president of the Lexington- Bluegrass Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2007, sales of existing homes were down about 10%, Craft says, while sales of newly built homes were down more -- nearly 23%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for an existing single-family home edged up 1.4% last year, nowhere near the 23% increase reported for December.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Franklin County, which includes Frankfort, has a population of about 48,000, many of them employees with stable jobs in the government or at the University of Kentucky in Lexington.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Craft says she expects the area's real estate market (particularly commercial property), which didn't see much of a run- up during the national real estate boom, to get a big kick from preparations and hosting of the All-Tech FEI World Equestrian Games. The games will be held in 2010 for the first time in the USA, in nearby Lexington, about 20 miles west of Frankfort.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices fell by a record 4% in Chicago in November -- but not low enough to help Megan and Ryan Webber afford a home.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The idea was to move to Chicago, but it would just be impossible to buy a decent house on the money we make," says Megan, 25, a nurse at a clinic in Rockford, Ill. Ryan Webber is a high school basketball coach, and they have a baby.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Megan searches the listings of homes for sale in surrounding suburbs, but the only ones that seem affordable are one- or two- bedroom condos starting at $180,000, and even that "would be a stretch for us."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The harsh reality for millions of families is that despite declining prices in many cities, homeownership remains unaffordable in a majority of cities for service workers in the fastest-growing occupations: nurses, retail salespeople, customer-service representatives, food-preparation workers and office clerks, according to research released Tuesday by the Center for Housing Policy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Because housing prices are so far out of reach for ordinary working families, the modest decline in home prices really hasn't made a big difference," says Jeffrey Lubell, who is executive director of the center.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study reviewed average pay for people in 60 occupations in 2007 and their ability to afford the median-priced home in about 200 metro areas. Researchers found, among other things, that:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Registered nurses are unable to afford a home in 108 markets, a slight improvement from 114 unaffordable markets in 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Customer-service employees can't afford a home in 185 metro areas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Retail salespeople and food-preparation workers were priced out of all the markets studied, as they were in 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Wages in retail sales declined by 10% or more across the board" last year, Lubell says. Such workers "couldn't afford a home in any market, and they couldn't afford a two-bedroom apartment in 162 markets."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Diego, where the median-priced home costs about $500,000, prices fell by a record 13% in November, compared with November 2006, according to  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But renters and would-be buyers there still face an affordability crisis, says Carroll Vaughan, interim CEO of the San Diego Housing Commission, which provides financial aid to 13,500 renting families. There are 30,000 families on a waiting list. And the rising foreclosure rate is forcing more troubled homeowners into the rental market, pushing up rents.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency gave financial assistance to about 100 first-time home buyers last year -- only about one-third as many as it helped before the housing boom, because prices have outstripped what aid the agency can offer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with financial help, "There just hasn't been any inventory (of homes for sale) that they can afford to buy," Vaughan says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-cost cities such as San Diego, Chicago and New York have been trying to create programs to ease the affordability squeeze on working families, but their measures fall short, says Rachel Drew, a research analyst at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are efforts out there that are well-intentioned; they are just not big enough," she says.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A series of reports out Tuesday sketched a bleak picture of the nation's residential real estate, with nearly 1.3 million homeowners in some state of foreclosure last year, 13 metro areas posting record price drops and a record number of vacant homes for sale.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, about 1% of homeowners were facing foreclosure during 2007 -- a 79% jump from 2006 -- according to RealtyTrac. And the number of homeowners entering foreclosure is expected to rise sharply this year, despite efforts by lenders to renegotiate mortgages.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders have pledged to help some of the hundreds of thousands of homeowners who are struggling with subprime adjustable-rate mortgages. But so far, they're "at best having a marginal effect on (foreclosure) rates, because of the sheer volume of properties we're talking about," says Rick Sharga of RealtyTrac. In fact, Sharga says, the rate of homes entering foreclosure accelerated at the end of 2007.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compounding the misery for many homeowners are falling home prices, which erase equity and in the worst cases can leave a homeowner with a mortgage that exceeds the value of the home itself. Prices in November fell in 17 of the 20 metro areas tracked by  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worst hit: Miami, where prices plunged 15% from November 2006, followed by double-digit declines in Las Vegas, Detroit, Phoenix, Tampa, Los Angeles and San Diego.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We reached another grim milestone in the housing market in November," says Robert Shiller, chief economist at MacroMarkets and co-developer of the index.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recession has also battered companies tied to the real estate industry.  <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span>, the nation's largest mortgage lender, reported Tuesday a $422 million loss for the October-December period, compared with a $622 million profit in the fourth quarter of 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the U.S. Census said Tuesday that about 2.18 million vacant homes were for sale in the fourth quarter. That's 2.8% of all homes, up slightly from the third quarter, and it ties the record- high percentage at the start of last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Newport, U.S. economist for Global Insight, says he's concerned that about 800,000 more vacant homes are for sale than would be the case in a normal market. That extra supply weighs down home builders and squeezes homeowners who want to sell.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction permits to build homes are off 56% from their peak two years ago, and Newport says they'll have to fall further.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for home prices, he says, "I see prices dropping 10% from where they are now, and it could be a lot more because the inventory figure hasn't budged."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes sank last year at the steepest pace since record-keeping began in 1963 -- and home builders expect their worst recession in decades to persist until at least the middle of this year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales totaled 774,000 in 2007, off a staggering 26% from 2006, the Commerce Department said Monday. And the drop could turn out to be even more dismal: Last year's figures are expected to be revised down next month after contract cancellations are counted. The median price was nearly flat at $246,900.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The situation seems to be getting worse," says Jerry Howard, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders, who expects the market to bottom in the spring. The 9.6-month supply of new homes for sale - - a record -- is "really distressing," he adds.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since peaking in July 2005, new home sales have plunged nearly 57%, and construction permits have fallen to half the level they were then.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home builders are cutting production, but with sales still collapsing they have to run to stand still," says Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics. "There is no sign of a bottom in any of these data."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For December, new home sales fell nearly 5% from November, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 604,000, down close to 41% from the previous December. For the month, the median price -- at which point half the homes cost more, half less -- was $219,200, a stunning 10% decline from the year before and the largest drop in 37 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kim Shelpman, CEO of Holiday Builders based in Melbourne, Fla., says she's cut prices back to 2003 levels. "Obviously, in the short term, the outlook is quite bleak," she says. Still, she adds that the recent drop in mortgage interest rates has led to more potential buyers visiting Holiday's communities and its website.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In markets where prices are sliding fast, there are deals aplenty for buyers like Jennifer Tischafer and her boyfriend, Brian Ignacio, who bought a home last month from  <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> in Gilbert, Ariz.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the price of their $215,000 home drops in value before all the lots in the development are sold,  <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> says it will pay them the difference.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We decided after a couple years of renting together, we wanted to buy a house," says Tischafer, 29.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAHB says about 4% of builders were guaranteeing home values, 58% were offering price cuts, more than half were paying some buyers' closing costs and 61% were offering free upgrades, according to its November survey of about 400 builders nationwide.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most striking trend in the San Bernardino real estate market is the surge in foreclosures. Lenders filed close to 24,000 notices of default last year, up nearly 150% from 2006, to alert delinquent borrowers that the foreclosure clock was ticking. And 7,727 homeowners lost their homes through foreclosure -- roughly one in 20 sales and up nearly 720% from the previous year, according to  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Foreclosures have been growing at a rapid pace for all of 2007, and we anticipate almost an avalanche in 2008," says Rich Cosner, president of  <span class="companylink">Prudential California Realty.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His agents are telling owners who need to sell within the next five years to put it on the market now because prices are projected to fall further. For buyers, though, interest rates are the lowest in years, and there's a 15-month supply of homes to choose from.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price declines are hitting every neighborhood, Cosner says, though the Rancho Cucamonga area, on the western edge of the county, is holding up best because it's closer to the job markets of Los Angeles and Orange counties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the real estate bubble, this market was on fire, with prices of resale homes soaring more than 167% from 2000 to 2005, according to  <span class="companylink">DataQuick.</span> But affordability problems, overbuilding and the mortgage meltdown have forced the housing market into a full correction. "I've been in this business for 35 years," Cosner says, "and I don't believe I've seen a more difficult market for homeowners."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He hopes the recent drop in interest rates, and the federal government's economic stimulus plan, will help stabilize real estate in San Bernardino, but, "We are not anticipating any significant turnaround until mid-2009."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most severe real estate recession in a generation sent sales of existing homes plunging 13% last year -- the steepest annual dive in 25 years -- and the median U.S. home price fell, probably for the first year since the Great Depression, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2008 outlook remains equally grim, though many experts expect the housing market to bottom out by the middle or end of the year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales could fall a further 13% this year, says Doug Duncan, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association -- and even more if the overall economy falls into recession. He puts those odds at 50- 50.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's going to be an intense and turbulent year," says Steve O'Connor, the MBA's senior vice president.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was, however, a glimmer of good news Thursday for buyers, sellers and homeowners, especially in such high-cost states as California and Florida, where home prices are falling and foreclosures are soaring. Congressional leaders struck an agreement on a stimulus package that includes a one-year rise in the loan limit for Fannie Mae and  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, to $729,750.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, Fannie and Freddie can buy only mortgages that are $417,000 or less. Larger loans, called jumbos, have higher rates because they're riskier for investors, and that's hurt borrowers in places like California, where the median home costs about $489,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The congressional package also raises the dollar limit on loans that can be insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which caters to first-time and working-income families, to $729,750 from $362,790. In today's market, most lenders require 10% down payments; the FHA loans need only 3%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stimulus plan will also help millions of homeowners refinance to take advantage of falling rates, which have hit their lowest point in nearly four years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But bigger loans and lower rates won't fix all the industry's problems. The real estate markets in Michigan and Ohio, for example, won't recover until residents stop moving away in search of jobs. And plenty of speculators on both coasts who bought homes with no money down might not qualify for new loans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, existing-home sales dipped 2.2% from November, to a seasonally adjusted pace of 4.89 million units. That pace was down 22% from December 2006. The median price fell a record 6% last month, to $208,400, reflecting trouble in the jumbo-loan market. "I keep thinking a bottom is near, but we haven't gotten there yet," says Joel Naroff, chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of last year, 5,652,000 existing houses and condos were sold. The median price was $218,900, down 1.4% from 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are closing the book on the worst year for housing possibly since the Depression," Naroff says.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market in Lincoln, Neb., is usually as good or as bad as the annual harvests of soybean, corn and other crops, which are big drivers of the local economy. Not last year, says Marcia Weddle, an agent at Century 21 Home &amp; Farm Realty.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Farmers had a great crop, it didn't get hailed out and real estate has gone to heck in a hand basket," she says. And now, foreclosures, though still relatively low, are popping up in a city that 30 years ago rarely saw one.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, the steady jobs provided by the state government and the University of Nebraska have kept a floor under existing-home sales. Those sales were down just 3.6% last year from the record set in 2005, according to the Lincoln Association of Realtors. The median price for the year was virtually flat compared with 2006, but still a record at $128,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes, on the other hand, have been falling since 2003, when it seemed every door framer had become a contractor and built homes on speculation, says Bob Moline, CEO and broker of Woods Bros. Realty.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those guys are gone," Moline says. Most of the excess inventory has been sold, he says, and the market for entry-level town houses was strong last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales last year of new homes fell 15% from 2006, and the median price dipped about 1% to $194,000 from the record set in 2006, according to the Lincoln Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of November, the most recent period for which Moline had figures, there was a 6.4-month supply of homes on the market, which is generally considered a balanced market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he says, many buyers assume they have the advantage. They're coming in with low-ball offers of 15% to 20% below the asking price, so sellers have to negotiate to get the deal done.   </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">As baby boomers retire, home markets will hurt ; As owners downsize, relocate, more houses will go up for sale   </span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next housing downturn is already on the horizon -- and it looks like it's going to be a long one.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the next two decades, as millions of aging baby boomers put their homes on the market, they'll put downward pressure on prices, and their exodus will reshape neighborhoods and cities coast to coast, according to research to be released today.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some states, the trend has already begun, making it harder for areas to recover from the real estate recession, which isn't expected to bottom out until the second half of this year at the earliest.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are already more sellers than buyers in six states: Connecticut, New York (excluding Manhattan), North Dakota, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Hawaii. The trend first hits areas with cold weather and traffic congestion, which tend to drive retirees away.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boomers were "an incoming tide for four decades. Now the tide's turned, and it's going to make it much harder for housing markets to rise," said Dowell Myers, professor of policy, planning and development at the University of Southern California and co-author of the study. The trend has long been anticipated, but Myers is the first to analyze buying and selling, state by state.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the ratio of seniors to working-age residents will increase by 67% in the next 20 years. As boomers age, more will move into assisted-living centers, apartments or relatives' houses. Those with two homes may sell one and retire to their vacation house. And when they pass on, many of their heirs will sell the properties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last hit should be warm-weather states, such as Florida, Arizona and Nevada, where retirees usually sell late in life. That's good news for homeowners in those states, where prices and sales are reeling from the collapse of the real estate bubble.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Myers' research, which included population and immigration projections from the U.S. Census, shows that the baby boom housing bubble will hit the Northeast and Midwest hard.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's most pertinent to declining parts of the country," said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution who agrees with Myers' conclusions. "The glut of homes on the market from baby boomers will depress the housing market and have an impact on some suburban neighborhoods that will come to look like older city neighborhoods that have undergone blight and disrepair."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The math is simple: 79 million boomers have driven up housing demand. That trend will reverse itself when boomers are age 65 to 75; there will be three sellers for each buyer, Myers says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and Frey say governments need to help create jobs so young adults and immigrants can buy homes.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marin County, the wealthy, picturesque area just north of San Francisco, with San Francisco Bay on one side and the Pacific on the other, is known for the enormous redwoods in the Muir Woods forest and the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed civic center.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even Marin hasn't escaped the meltdown in the credit markets. Sales of single-family homes priced under $1 million -- the market mainly for first-time home buyers, if you can believe it -- were off 21% last year compared with 2006. Meanwhile, condos below that price range plunged 32%, according to Valerie Castellana, president of the Marin Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The first-time home-buyer market has been most affected by changes in the banking structure," Castellana says. "There were products available to them with very little money down. Those products have mostly disappeared."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the luxury end of the market, where buyers tend to pay cash, remains robust. Sales of homes priced above $3 million soared 65% last year; condos over $1 million jumped by 32%. That explains why Marin's median home price rose 9% last year, to $1,025,700, even though overall single-family home sales declined 9%. At the same time, the median price for a condo edged up 4% to $570,000, even though sales tumbled 22%.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in 11 large metro areas posted record declines in October, according to data released Wednesday, more evidence that 2007 was one of the worst real estate markets since the year the United States entered World War II.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflecting tighter lending standards and a huge number of homes for sale, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 cities slid 6.1% compared with October of last year, led by Miami, Tampa, Detroit and San Diego.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Atlanta and Dallas dipped for the first time during the current downturn. This was the 10th month in a row that the index has shown negative annual price comparisons, and the results are getting worse. The index was down 1.4% from September to October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When was the last time we had a bigger drop than this? It looks like 1941," Robert Shiller, economics professor at Yale University and co-developer of the index, said in an interview.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Pearl Harbor was bombed on Dec. 7, "The U.S. wasn't in the war yet, but it sure looked bad. Hitler was raging in Europe. ... You didn't want to be buying a house then."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the primary force behind the real estate recession is the almost year's supply of homes for sale. Many are being heavily discounted by builders, speculators and lenders who have become owners through foreclosure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shiller said he expects prices to fall another 5% to 7% next year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it's clearly a buyers' market, demand is being constrained by mortgage lenders, who got burned by their own reckless lending of recent years. Now, home shoppers with a poor record for paying bills on time and little saved for a down payment are having serious difficulty getting a loan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of (buyers) haven't come to the realization that the subprime market no longer exists," said Ritch Workman of Workman Mortgage in Melbourne, Fla. "Mortgage brokers are turning away more and more borrowers."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone with a credit score below 620, which is subprime territory, he said, "will pay through the nose" to get a mortgage.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In areas where home prices are falling, it's impossible to get a loan for 100% of the purchase price, unless the buyer can qualify for a loan from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Most lenders now require at least a 5% down payment, Workman said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose in just three of the 20 cities in the Case- Shiller index in October: Charlotte; Portland, Ore.; and Seattle. But Patrick Newport, U.S. economist for Global Insight, said he expects prices in Seattle and Portland will turn down by the end of the year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, where prices fell 12.4%, Ron Shuffield advises sellers to wait if they don't have to sell now.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a lot of buyers in the market, said Shuffield, president of Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors, and with "a little extra research and effort, there are certainly some very, very good deals out there to be had today. You can find deals you could not have found a year ago, or even three months ago."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quaint old town square in Prescott, Ariz., is usually what hooks people who are thinking of moving to the area.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lined with boutiques and small restaurants, the center of Prescott attracts retirees looking to escape Phoenix's hotter weather and crowded roads about 100 miles to the south.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market in Prescott, with a population of about 42,000, also never got as overheated as some other parts of Arizona. But given the average home price of $384,400 and an economy built on service and retail companies, some working families are moving to nearby Prescott Valley, where the average home costs $238,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national real estate recession and mortgage crisis haven't been felt as hard in Prescott.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part, that's because retirees usually don't need to rely on mortgage financing as much as the typical home buyer does. From January through October, home sales in Prescott were off just 8%, according to Karen Winton, an agent at M3 Properties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the number of shoppers has dropped off in the past five months, Winton says, forcing sellers to slash prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's made buying an existing home more affordable than buying a vacant lot and building a home from scratch. Land sales from January through October were down 46% from the same period last year.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goodbye, home equity. The median price for an existing home plunged by a record 5.1% in October, shrinking values back to March 2005 levels, as many buyers struggled to get financing, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for an existing home now stands at $207,800. What's more, further declines probably lie ahead. So far this month, even more sellers have cut asking prices in cities including Miami, San Francisco, San Diego and Washington, according to an analysis for USA TODAY by ZipRealty.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes dipped 1.2% from September to October to a 4.97 million pace, driven by condo sales, which tanked 9.1%. Compared with October last year, sales of single-family homes and condos sank by nearly 21%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That light at the end of the housing-meltdown tunnel appears to be an oncoming train," says Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors. "With so many choices and so few buyers, the median sales price is cratering."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 11 months' worth of homes are crowding the market, and Adam York, economic analyst at  <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>, says he expects it'll take up to three years to work through that glut of homes, depending on how quickly prices continue to fall.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is twofold: Buyers with poor credit and little money for a down payment have fewer options now to get a mortgage. And many of those who need to borrow more than $417,000 -- a so-called jumbo loan -- are being squeezed out by higher interest rates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Southern California, sales financed with mortgages above $417,000 have dropped by 60% since the summer, according to  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven D'Antoni, 32, who was looking to buy a home last summer, made a $680,000 offer on a property in California's San Gabriel Valley in July.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By the time we got it to the lender, everything was in chaos," says D'Antoni, 32, a vice president of Origin Laboratories, which makes Purosol, an environmentally safe cleaner. "In order for me to qualify for the loan, I had to have put down a much larger down payment, which I didn't have."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lender, Countrywide, also raised the interest rate to about 7.5% from about 6%, and capped the amount it would lend on the property at $399,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That totally killed the deal," D'Antoni says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, there are areas where home sales and prices are holding steady, if not rising, including Champaign, Ill., Albuquerque and Green Bay, Wis. Even in areas where prices are falling, such as California, Florida and Arizona, there are good deals and a smorgasbord of choices for those with solid credit and money for at least a 10% down payment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victor Koenig began looking to buy his first home in South Florida in April. His agent at ZipRealty showed him 53 houses, condos and town homes before he found his "fantastic deal."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was and continues to be a buyer's market," says Koenig, 46, chief statistician for Playbook, a sports journalism company. He found a three-bedroom home with a swimming pool in the city of Sunrise listed for $299,000 at the end of August. A couple of weeks later, the seller cut the price to $289,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Koenig snapped up the home with a $265,000 bid. He moved in a few weeks ago.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in many college towns across the country, the real estate market in Champaign is sheltered from the highest peaks and lowest troughs of the national housing cycles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana lies about 140 miles south of Chicago, in a county with a population of about 185,000. There are roughly 43,000 students and 3,000 faculty members, so you don't have to do a lot of math to see how much stability the university provides to the local housing market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between July and September, sales of single-family homes were up 9.4% over a lackluster third quarter last year, while prices edged down slightly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any market, there are always strong and weak pockets, and in Champaign, condos have taken a beating.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 116 condos were sold in the third quarter, down from 141 in the year-ago period. Prices, meantime, plummeted 23%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo sales have been slow for the past two years, says Stefanie Pratt, an agent at Coldwell Banker Devonshire Realty.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the most recent quarter looks especially bleak in comparison, because several new developments were completed last fall and sold out within weeks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For new single-family homes, Pratt says, nine subdivisions are under construction. Sales are especially healthy in the price range for first-time buyers -- the low $100,000s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tighter lending standards have shut out some buyers, she says, but many of them have sought help through local grant programs designed to help home buyers.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a red-hot market during the housing boom, Jacksonville now faces tougher times. Still, even though foreclosures and a surplus of new houses and condominiums have dragged down sales, Jacksonville's housing market remains in better shape than the rest of Florida.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part, that's because the job market has remained fairly robust. "Jacksonville is a very business-oriented city," says Linda Sherrer, president of Prudential Network Realty.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor was Jacksonville flooded by the investors who swept into South Florida during the housing boom to buy and flip properties for a profit. "It didn't really catch on here, and so we were blessed," says Hank Oltmanns, president of the Northeast Florida Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite an unusually large inventory of homes for sale, overall prices are rising. That's not true, though, for newly built houses and condos that aren't on the waterfront, which have tended to fall in price this year, brokers say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has evolved considerably. At its peak, "People were fighting over properties before the 'for sale' sign got into the yard," says Janie Boyd, a broker associate at Norville Realty. "Today, a home may be on the market 90 days to six months or more."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the industry is trying to help stop foreclosures by training brokers about short sales, Oltmanns says. In a short sale, a lender lets a homeowner sell a property for less than the value of the mortgage and thereby avoid foreclosure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it will probably be awhile before the market can reverse course. "In 2008, we are anticipating a similar market to this year," Sherrer says. "But in the latter part of next year, it will start to pick up, and we're ready for it."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wallet-busting cost of home insurance, which has as much as tripled in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina, is one of the biggest weights on its housing market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a $175,000 home, a buyer will have to shell out $4,200 to $4,800 a year for insurance, says Lisa Heindel, an agent at Latter &amp; Blum Realtors. Before the hurricane, the cost was about $1,200 annually. That huge spike is pushing buyers into lower-priced housing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes are sitting on the market, on average, about 80 days -- a month longer than this time last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't have a lot of buyers," Heindel says. "We've got a reduced population."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers in New Orleans, especially minorities, were also highly dependent on subprime mortgages -- loans for those with damaged credit. The difficulty in obtaining those loans in the current credit crunch, Heindel says, has dampened sales.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Frank Trapani, president of the New Orleans Metropolitan Association of Realtors, says, "Every area is coming back.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The greatest struggle is in areas where the city got wet, simply because it is difficult to have any confidence in the area when you don't have confidence in the political structure yet," Trapani says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new governor, Bobby Jindal, should help restore the confidence that homeowners and companies need to rebuild in battered parts of the city such as the Lower 9th Ward, Trapani says. He predicts that sales should bounce back in the spring.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With signs of even darker days ahead, sales of existing homes collapsed in September, falling a far-worse-than-expected 8% from August -- the steepest dive since the National Association of Realtors began combining figures for single-family homes and condos in 1999.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For anyone who thinks the housing recession can't get any worse,  <span class="companylink">Re/Max International</span> issued figures Wednesday that suggested it can.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re/Max, which analyzed existing home sales in five cities for USA TODAY, says October totals so far are down sharply from last year. In Seattle and Baltimore, for example, sales in the first three weeks of this month are off more than 44%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For September, the NAR said, the seasonally adjusted sales rate of 5.04 million homes was the weakest in at least eight years and down 19% from September last year. After months of flat prices, the median price -- half the homes cost more, half less -- fell in September to $211,700, down 4.2% from a year earlier. It's expected to drop further because of the credit crisis.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mortgage finance is in a major depression," says Scott Anderson, senior economist at  <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo.</span> In states such as California and Florida that saw huge gains during the boom, "we're going to have price declines not seen since the Great Depression, through 2008."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing figures are so anemic that some economists say the Federal Reserve is all but sure to cut its target for short-term interest rates when it meets next week, to guard against recession.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect a cut of 1/4-point at the end of the month and maybe another cut in December," Anderson says. But "I'm not as optimistic (as some economists) that the Fed is going to be a major savior here."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A record number of homes for sale has been magnified by a crush of homes entering foreclosure. There were 4.4 million homes on the market in September -- a 10.5-month supply and the most since the NAR began tracking the data.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fundamental problem for the market is too much inventory," says Mark Zandi, chief economist for  <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales over the next few months, Zandi says, are "going to be so bad it will be hard to imagine worse," and that will be the bottom.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cities, home sales are suffering from the collapse of the subprime market and a wave of foreclosures. But Tacoma, Wash., is largely insulated from that turmoil.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part, that's because the area is home to two military installations: Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base. And it has a leading North American seaport that's a gateway to Asia and Alaska.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some new residents are drawn to the area for its proximity to three large national parks: Mount Rainier, Olympic and North Cascades.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have a real solid market year in and year out," says Patrick Maddock, president of the Tacoma-Pierce County Association of Realtors. "Foreclosure is not a big problem here."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean home sales in Tacoma are surging. In fact, they've taken a dip this year. And existing homes take longer to sell: 66 days this year, vs. 49 in 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason Tacoma's home sales have slowed, experts say, is that they're following record sales in 2004 and 2005. The downturn hasn't had an effect on prices, which are still rising.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pricing is a little bit ahead of the market," says Tom Hume, a real estate agent at Windermere Professional Partners. "Homeowners need to get more realistic before they find a buyer."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, because Tacoma has a solid economy based on strong employment: "If buyers are waiting for the bottom to fall out, it's not going to happen," Hume says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tacoma also attracts some homeowners who work in Seattle. "They prefer the less-urban locale, and they like to maintain their quality of life here because it's more affordable," Maddock says.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction ran 10/2/2007: The foreclosure report given to the Akron, Ohio, City Council last week contained inaccurate information, which was included in a story Friday. The corrected study, resubmitted to the city council Monday, said 51% of homes sold from February to August in the 10 worst-affected neighborhoods were sold by mortgage lenders for a fraction of their value.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest evidence of a decaying real estate market came in a government report Thursday that new home sales in August hit their lowest point in seven years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for a more vivid illustration, look at Akron, Ohio. In 10 of that city's hard-hit neighborhoods, a report given to the City Council this week said 79% of all homes sold from February to August this year were unloaded by lenders for a fraction of their value. In Akron, as elsewhere in the USA, the dumping of foreclosed homes on the market has squeezed both builders and sellers who must compete against additional properties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, as builders slashed prices and held "deal of the century"-style blowout sales to move unsold inventory, the median- price new home fell to $225,700, a 7.5% decline. That was the largest percentage drop in 37 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is just hideous," said Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics. "Housing is nowhere near bottom; neither is its wider impact."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a bloated eight-month supply of new homes for sale, it's clearly a buyer's market. Yet, many would-be buyers are having a harder time qualifying for a mortgage. The average rate on the 30- year fixed-rate mortgage crept up to 6.42% this week, according to  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loans for people with tarnished credit have virtually vanished. Lenders are demanding higher down payments and more proof of income and assets. And rates for "jumbo" loans -- those above $417,000 -- are hovering near 8%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From July to August, sales of newly built homes fell 8.3%, to a seasonally adjusted pace of 795,000, the Commerce Department said. That's down 21% from August of last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The big thing that's happened here is the progressive meltdown of the mortgage finance system," says David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). Seiders doesn't expect home sales to hit bottom before early next year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an NAHB survey this month, 62% of builders said the mortgage crisis was having some or a substantial impact on their business, up from 33% in March.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underscoring that point,  <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> said Thursday that it lost nearly $36 million in its fiscal third quarter, and that 58% of buyers canceled their contracts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We see no signs that the housing market is stabilizing and believe it will be some time before a recovery begins," says Jeffrey Mezger, CEO of  <span class="companylink">KB Home.</span> "Rising foreclosure rates are intensifying surplus inventory and will likely drive further home-price reductions."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors, which reported Tuesday that sales of existing homes fell last month to their lowest point in five years, expects more dismal figures for September, given the crisis in the mortgage industry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week,  <span class="companylink">Foxtons</span>, a real estate company in West Long Branch, N.J., said it will close because of the slumping housing market and lay off 350 of its 380 workers, The Asbury Park (N.J.) Press reported.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The end of the real estate recession seems nowhere in sight, in light of a slew of bleak news Tuesday of falling sales and prices, a severe decline in construction and deep losses and layoffs at one of the nation's largest builders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell last month to their lowest point in five years, the National Association of Realtors says. The NAR says it expects more dismal figures for September as the housing market reels from the crisis in the mortgage industry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the September figures might be much worse.  <span class="companylink">Re/Max International</span>, which analyzed existing-home sales in five major cities for USA TODAY, says September totals so far are down sharply from last year.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've given up forecasting how low housing sales will go," says Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Stuart Miller, CEO of Lennar, has given up forecasting the builder's profits after reporting a record loss of $514 million in its third fiscal quarter, as it laid off 35% of its employees and wrote down the value of real estate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar warned that more pink slips are on the way. The company began construction on 60% fewer homes in the June-through-August period compared with the same fiscal quarter last year. At the same time, nearly one-third of buyers canceled their contracts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"August seemed to be a melting pot of all things negative," Miller says. The declines were felt in every region of the country, he says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech Tuesday, Charles Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said there's growing evidence that "the recovery in residential construction is likely to be delayed until later in 2008 than many forecasters originally thought."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR says sales of existing homes fell about 4% from July to August, to a seasonally adjusted pace of 5.5 million, down 13% from August last year. At that rate, to sell the record number of homes for sale would take 10 months -- the longest backlog since the NAR began tracking it in 1999.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR says the median price -- where half the homes cost more, half cost less -- was all but flat at $224,500 in August. But a more widely followed gauge -- the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index -- showed prices in 20 large metro areas were off nearly 4% in July compared with July last year. It's the steepest drop since the index began falling in February.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, an NAR senior economist, says he can't predict when the housing market will hit bottom. Still, he says, the market should get a boost from the interest rate cuts last week by the Federal Reserve and from legislation in Congress to reform the Federal Housing Administration. The FHA provides mortgage insurance for low-income and first-time buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With sales falling for two years now, Yun says, "It's my firm view there is significant pent-up demand."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If your vision of domestic bliss is a single-family house with four bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths, 2,200 square feet of space and a two- car garage, you'll pay $2.1 million more to buy the house in Beverly Hills than in Killeen, Texas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those are the most-expensive and least-expensive U.S. real estate markets in Coldwell Banker's annual home price survey of nearly 400 cities, being released today. Beverly Hills is again No.1, and California has eight cities in the top 10. Jumping from seventh place to No.2 was Greenwich, Conn., where huge Wall Street bonuses have helped drive up property values. Boston also made this year's top 10 list.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas had three of the country's most-affordable cities, according to the Home Price Comparison index.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average U.S. home price was little changed from last year, in part because buyers of higher-priced homes have been less affected by the slowdown in housing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study isn't scientific: It uses only Coldwell Banker data and surveys only markets where the company has an office. But it gives a rough apples-to-apples comparison of what a single-family home, with the same dimensions and number of bedrooms and bathrooms, costs in different parts of the world.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Famously expensive Manhattan was excluded from the study because there aren't enough comparable single-family homes among its high- rise buildings. London, one of the world's priciest markets, isn't included because Coldwell Banker doesn't have a franchise there.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Dublin ranked as the most-expensive international market surveyed, up from fifth place last year, with a price this year of $2.1 million. The cheapest remains Bogota, where a similar home would fetch a mere $140,100.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At $417,760 for the average home, Warsaw is the foreign market closest to the $422,343 U.S. average for Coldwell Banker's hypothetical home.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans who are thinking of retiring or buying a vacation home overseas might be shocked to find how much less their dollars buy this year compared with just two years ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of the dollar has sunk against most major currencies. It's down more than 15% against the euro, which is the common currency used in 13 European countries, including Germany, France and Ireland.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 4 million Americans live abroad, the State Department says, with Mexico, Canada and the United Kingdom the most popular. In Mexico City, the average single-family house costs $277,213; in Montreal, a similar home would go for $252,350, on average.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the weak dollar has made U.S. properties more attractive to foreign buyers, says Jim Gillespie, CEO of Coldwell Banker. They're taking advantage of falling prices in Florida, California, Arizona and Las Vegas.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market in Madison, the capital of Wisconsin, is partially buffered from national housing trends because of the stability of its employment base, which is concentrated in government jobs, the state university, health care and insurance.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though home sales are down about 7% this year in Madison, prices are still slowly rising. About 5,400 houses and condos are on the market -- near a record. That's about a seven-month supply at the current sales pace. Many of the for-sale listings are condos, the result of overly optimistic construction during the real estate boom.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the sales decline, this year should be the fourth- highest on record. "You get spoiled when you have year after year of records," says John Deininger, executive vice president of the Realtors Association of South Central Wisconsin. He adds, "One area where we are doing better than much of the country: We are not seeing the deterioration of values. We have not had speculators in the market."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sellers, though, are having to lower their asking prices, says Kim Nemacheck, an agent with Restaino Bunbury &amp; Associates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But homes near the University of Wisconsin and those priced below $225,000 for first-time home buyers are still selling well. "The higher you go in price," she says, "the longer they're on the market."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive home   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas and Martha Carter are selling this house, designed by renowned local architect Frank Riley and built in 1926. The home has a panoramic view of the Madison skyline.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toledo is known as the Glass City, because it's produced everything from windows and windshields to bottles and glass art. But these days, the city in northwestern Ohio seems to be struggling to right its economic base.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toledo has been hit by job losses, home foreclosures and a housing market slowdown. Home prices and sales have continued to fall this year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes for sale has climbed to an unusually high 9,700 in the Toledo area, says Mark Kruse, a real estate agent at The Danberry Co.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no wonder that the inventory of homes for sale is rising. Last year, there were 4,000 homes in foreclosure in Lucas County, where Toledo is based. This year, it could exceed 5,000, Kruse says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now the collapse of the subprime mortgage market will make it harder for many first-time home buyers to obtain a mortgage, unless they can qualify for a conventional loan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents say the city is trying to turn around the economy and the housing market. At least Toledo, unlike some other cities, isn't faced with home prices that once skyrocketed and are now collapsing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home sales are not dropping so fast," says Ray Henderson, president of the Toledo Board of Realtors. "Home volume is down a little, but I think we're keeping an even keel."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news, Henderson says, is that the city is experiencing some new construction. There's a new open-air mall called Fallen Timbers. A sports arena is being built downtown. And new condos in the warehouse district are being sold for prices as high as $300,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the housing market is linked to the job market. Toledo is well-known for the auto industry, including Jeep and Chrysler, and there has been a loss of white-collar jobs in that industry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, young college graduates have been moving from Toledo to larger cities. So now, Henderson says, many local companies are making a more vigorous effort to attract and retain them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Toledo's horizon is a research and technology corridor, which would help create more jobs, Kruse says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive   </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Elmira, N.Y. ; Median price sinking, but all-cash deals up   </span>
</div><div class="author">Noelle Knox   </div><div>450 words</div><div>28 August 2007</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>English</div><div>© 2007 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's going on in Elmira? The median price for a single-family home there -- just $71,700 in the second quarter, lowest of any metro area -- slid nearly 18% compared with the April-June period last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. It's the second-consecutive quarter that Elmira has suffered the worst decline of the 149 metro areas the NAR tracks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vicki Schamel, associate broker at Prudential Ambrose &amp; Shoemaker, reviewed the data and found some striking trends. There were 354 single-family homes sold in the greater Elmira-Corning area in the second quarter of this year, 52 of them within the Elmira city limits. But here's a surprise: Nearly one-quarter of the purchases in the region were cash deals, an unusually high figure. "There seems to be (an increase) in investors buying fixer-uppers," Schamel says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Elmira, known as the city where Mark Twain wrote many of his most popular works and where he's buried, the homes sold on average for 91% of the asking price. The lowest price was $11,000, the highest, $169,000, and the average, $50,000. There were a lot more homes bought at the lower end of the scale, which pulled down the average and median prices. An average home sold in 144 days, a sign of a balanced market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In this area, we really don't deal in the hundreds of thousands of dollars," says Nikki Dye, president of the Elmira-Corning Regional Board of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price drop in the second quarter "sounds like a large number, but in reality, we're only talking about $10,000 fluctuations."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Elmira metro area, the population has gradually declined with the loss of manufacturing jobs, to about 30,000 from a peak of about 50,000 around 1950. But the employment base, supported by such companies as Corning and Sikorsky Aircraft, seems stable now, says Kevin Keeley, president of the Chemung County Chamber of Commerce, which includes Elmira.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like him, many residents are attracted by the low home prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeley, who moved to Elmira 10 years ago from Clifton, Va., says, "I sold a shack down there and moved up here and bought a nice little palace for one-third of the money that I sold my house in Clifton for, and I like this house better."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news Monday from the National Association of Realtors was bad enough: Sales of existing homes fell in July to their slowest pace in five years. The glut of homes for sale is at a 16-year high. The median price is down for a record 12th month in a row.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's really grim, though, is this: None of the figures reflect this month's turmoil in the mortgage market. Which is why the numbers will likely be even worse in coming months. And why the NAR doesn't expect the housing market to recover until early next year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unfortunately, worse news lies ahead," said Nigel Gault, U.S. economist for Global Insight. "That will mean more foreclosures and fewer qualified buyers, adding up to lower home sales and prices. It is hard to see a bottom before mid-2008."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes for sale is at its peak since the last housing recession, in 1991. There's a 9.2-month supply of single- family homes and nearly a year's worth of condos.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's pressuring sellers to cut prices. "Prices would be falling even if all was well in the mortgage market," says Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics. "So in today's troubled circumstances, we have to expect steep declines for the foreseeable future."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.75 million. That was 9% lower than in July last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, proving again that all real estate is local, sales in the West and the Northeast managed to rise from June to July and were flat in the South. It was the 2.2% drop in sales in the Midwest that weighed down the national numbers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Northeast saw price increases close to 6%" compared with a year ago, says Lawrence Yun, the NAR's senior economist. "That was the first region to undergo weakness, and they are now climbing out of it. That is implying other regions could follow a similar path."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any recovery might be brief. Mark Fleming, an economist at FirstAmerican CoreLogic, says high-cost areas will suffer from cutbacks in "jumbo" loans -- those over $417,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The increase in jumbo (interest) rates, if sustained for any length of time," he says, "will put further downward pressure on sales in those markets."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For evidence of what is spooking Wall Street and wreaking havoc on the mortgage industry, one need only look at the housing market in Stockton, Calif., 40 miles south of Sacramento.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the real estate boom, Stockton was a hotbed of speculation, bidding wars, and rocketing prices. Now, foreclosures are soaring, sales are plummeting, and there is more than a year's supply of homes and condos on the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market "is still sliding," said Larry Underhill, president of the Lodi Association of Realtors, which covers Stockton. "The buzz is there is just a ton of foreclosures, and banks are going to own a lot more property before it's over."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders filed 1,129 notices of default against borrowers who were behind on their mortgages in the second quarter, according to  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems, up 205% from the second quarter last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of the foreclosures, Underhill said, are homes purchased with subprime, adjustable-rate mortgages or exotic loans that allowed the buyer to pay only the interest, or less, for a set period of time. As their monthly payments reset to higher rates, some homeowners and investors are finding they can't afford them and can't refinance -- either because the property is worth less than they owe, or the mortgage they hoped to get no longer exists in today's risk-averse market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While economic growth in Stockton, heavily dependent on agriculture, will help turn this market around, the credit squeeze on Wall Street is making it harder for buyers to qualify for a loan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underhill says he's seeing homes go under contract two or three times, and each time, the deal falls apart because "buyers can't qualify, or buyers are understandably cautious. They see property values sliding and are saying, 'Why am I doing this?'"   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market blues showed no signs of lifting Wednesday as the National Association of Realtors warned that U.S. home sales in 2007 could fall to a five-year low, and major home builder  <span class="companylink">Toll Bros.</span> warned of a 21% drop in quarterly revenue.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It still looks pretty gruesome," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors. "The market has truly cratered, and it's not going to turn as quickly as people had hoped."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bloated home prices, feverish real estate speculation and widespread defaults of subprime mortgages have led to a housing slump that some economists fear could drag the U.S. economy into recession.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its monthly forecast, the NAR projects existing-home sales this year of 6 million -- the lowest since 2002 -- and sales of 6.4 million next year. It forecasts new-home sales of 852,000 this year and 848,000 in 2008. That's down from 1.1 million in 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, NAR senior economist, said that the inventory glut of unsold homes should be reduced by serious long-term home buyers, fewer speculative investors and fewer new homes under construction.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the population growing, the demand for homes isn't going away {ndash} it's just being delayed," Yun said in a statement.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile,  <span class="companylink">Toll Bros.</span>, the largest U.S. builder of luxury homes, said that its fiscal third-quarter revenue dropped 21% to $1.2 billion. Final results will be released Aug. 22. CEO Robert Toll cautioned the credit crisis could further hurt demand for homes, and he said the company would not provide earnings guidance because of the volatile market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Hesitant customers remain on the sidelines, unsure of whether home prices have bottomed," Toll said. "We caution that, with the uncertainties roiling the credit markets right now, the pace of home sales could slow further until the credit markets settle down."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other housing-industry companies are hurting, too. Home builders  <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> and  <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA</span> recently posted quarterly losses, while  <span class="companylink">American Home Mortgage</span> Investment filed for bankruptcy-court protection this week.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How long will the housing slump last? Many factors come into play, including job growth, interest rates, personal income levels and consumer sentiment. Perhaps the biggest unknown: whether the credit crisis and foreclosures in the subprime mortgage market will worsen or level off in the coming quarters.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, believes the housing market should bounce back next year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sales and housing starts should start to come together in 2008 and move into 2009 with pretty good momentum," Seiders said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Costello, CEO of Builder Homesite, a marketing group for home builders, says that home builders are taking a cautious view of the slump. They've seen several real estate boom-and-bust cycles, from the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1990s to the drop in home sales after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita two years ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a difficult time now," Costello said. "We haven't seen the market bottom out and rebound yet, and when that happens will vary from market to market."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Eagle County, Colo., is primarily a winter ski destination, the real estate market there has been relatively protected from the slowdown affecting many of the nation's coastal cities. That is especially true of the Vail and Beaver Creek areas, and for homes in Eagle County priced above $5 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales volume in the county started falling last October as higher prices and interest rates knocked more year-round residents out of the market, says Asher Maslan, chairman of the Vail Board of Realtors. During the real estate boom, condos that sold for $150,000 in 2004 doubled in price in 2005, creating an affordability crisis among the locals who tend to work in lower-paying service jobs in retail, hotel and food services. (Eagle County's population of about 70,000 swells to more than 200,000 during the ski season.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median single-family home in Eagle County peaked at $790,000 in March, according to  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems. It has come down to $582,000, but that's still a financial stretch for most families, Maslan says. "They are starting on thin margins to begin with. ... Most of our locals buy with the assistance of parents or family friends."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The county, which has only 25% of the affordably priced housing it needs, has an initiative to build 1,200 housing units that will have deed restrictions limiting price appreciation to 3% to 6% a year, Asher said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk about bucking the national trend. Home sales in Sioux Falls, the largest city in South Dakota, are on track to set a record this year. Prices are rising, too, yet remain affordable compared with most of the country.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our prices don't wildly fluctuate; we see instead 3% to 4% increases" annually, says Barton Hacker, CEO of the Realtor Association of the Sioux Empire.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another sign of strength in the market: The average home is selling in 88 days, down from 109 days last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales activity has really picked up in the past six weeks, after rainy and cool weather in the spring kept some home buyers indoors, says Jay Zea, an agent for HJN Team Real Estate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says homes priced for first-time buyers are selling well, as are those at the top end of the market, where prices range from $450,000 to $1 million-ish. But sales are "tough" in the midrange, from $200,000 to $350,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market has benefited as the economy in Sioux Falls has broadened from its traditional meat-packing and manufacturing roots. Hospitals and financial companies, particularly in credit card processing, have moved to South Dakota to take advantage of the state's absence of a corporate income tax. Sanford Health is the largest employer in Sioux Falls, and as Zea notes, "Physicians -- they've got the money to buy."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market was socked by bad news for a third consecutive day Thursday, with sales of new homes falling more than expected, two builders posting dismal results and a leading economist predicting that foreclosure losses will top $113 billion -- more than the Federal Reserve projected last week.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing signs that the housing slump will be deeper and longer than investors had expected jolted the financial markets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The probability of a global financial shock is low but now rising," says Mark Zandi, chief economist for  <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, who released a study Thursday with darker predictions for the real estate market. "The preconditions for a shock are in place."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zandi isn't projecting a recession but says, "We're now expecting the economy to grow measurably below what we thought it would be at the beginning of the year."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason is job losses in the housing industry. Planned job cuts in the real estate, construction and mortgage sectors reached 37,564 in the first half of the year. That's 65% more than all the job cuts announced in those businesses in 2006, according to a report Thursday by  <span class="companylink">Challenger Gray &amp; Christmas</span>, an outplacement firm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The impact of the housing market slump is probably even greater than these numbers indicate," says CEO John Challenger. "We are seeing job cuts in several other industries, including retail, consumer-products manufacturing and industrial-products manufacturing."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes slid 6.6% from May to June, the Commerce Department said -- and were down a sharp 22% from June of last year. That report follows Wednesday's news that sales of existing homes fell last month to their lowest point in nearly five years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home last month -- the point at which half the homes cost more and half cost less -- dropped 2.2% from June of last year, to $237,900.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market tried pulling the rip cord, but the parachute didn't open," Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors wrote to his clients Thursday. Sales of new homes, he says, are on track for their worst calendar-year showing in a decade.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are already bleeding red ink. D.R. Horton and  <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes</span> reported bleak quarterly results Thursday. D.R. Horton said its new orders were down 40%; Beazer's orders were off 30%. Those reports followed news Wednesday that  <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span> had posted a loss. And  <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span>'s market-shaking earnings report Tuesday showed spreading weakness in the mortgage industry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zandi says he expects about 2.5 million homeowners to default on primary mortgages over the next two years. He also forecasts that a record 10% of homeowners with subprime mortgages -- those with the weakest credit -- will be in foreclosure by the middle of next year, up from the current 4%. "The U.S. housing downturn has at least another year to run," he says.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence mounted Wednesday that the housing recession could worsen as sales of existing homes in June fell to a nearly five- year low, and a real estate outlook predicted that new-home construction might not fully recover for at least three years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department will release June figures today for sales of newly built homes, which are expected to be lower and to continue falling into 2008, says Dave Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The ball is still rolling down the hill," Seiders says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction, he says, probably won't rebound completely till 2010 or 2011. That means housing will continue to exert a drag on the overall economy. How badly depends, in part, on the deteriorating picture in the mortgage industry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span>, the nation's largest mortgage lender, stunned Wall Street on Tuesday with dismal results from delinquent loans and foreclosures -- even for "prime loans" to borrowers with good credit histories.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes fell nearly 4% from May to June, to the slowest pace since November 2002. Sales were off about 11% from June of last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes for sale fell a "surprising" 4%, says Lawrence Yun, the NAR's senior economist. But Yun says the lower supply likely reflects the frustration of sellers who have taken homes off the market or rented them out.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lupe Arroyo and her husband, Richard, for example, just took their Sacramento home off the market. Having tried to sell it since April, they cut their $369,000 asking price three times, to $329,500.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This last reduction was well below market value," Arroyo, 36, says. "It was a giveaway (price), and we still had a low-ball offer. We've frankly run out of time. We were planning to move to a different area, and we wanted to get our daughter enrolled in a new school. Now, it's one month before school starts."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their agent, Tracey Saizan, says five of her clients have taken their homes off the market in the past few days. "I've had heart-to- heart talks with sellers who refuse to keep reducing prices."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR said the median price for existing homes -- the point where half cost more, half less -- edged up 0.3% in June to $230,100. But Seiders says, "That has to be misleading," reflecting some strength at the market's high end.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He predicts that existing-home prices, which have dropped about 3% nationally since last autumn, according to the Case-Shiller Home Price index, will fall another 5% by year's end and slightly more in 2008.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to need something like that," Seiders says, "to get this market back in balance."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Scottsdale, one of the most affluent cities in Arizona, the upper end of the housing market is holding steady and propping up overall home prices, which are effectively flat, says Matt Deuitch, president of the Scottsdale Area Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The luxury-home market has fared a little better than the rest of the market over the last year or so," adds Mike Glover of Prudential Arizona Properties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sellers on Scottsdale's tony north side who have homes priced over $1 million are having to shave several hundred thousand dollars off their asking prices, but most are still selling in less than 40 days, says Karina Magana, an agent at Help-U-Sell Desert Vista Properties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's impressive, considering there's a record 45,175 single- family homes for sale in this bedroom community of Phoenix. When sales peaked in Scottsdale in March 2005, there were only about 2,900 homes on the market. "We've gone from an all-time low to an all-time high in supply," Deuitch says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the sales volume at the top end of the market isn't enough to make up for the skidding sales for homes priced below $700,000. Compared with May of last year, single-family-home sales in Scottsdale overall are down nearly 23%.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a year's supply of homes and condos sitting on the market, the West Palm Beach-Boca Raton area of Florida has a ways to go before it can recover from the excesses of the real estate boom. The feverish buying and building spree peaked in the summer of 2005, and the market is still cooling.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, however, some signs that the worst might be in the past. Condo sales, which make up about 45% of this market, rose 11% in May, while prices dipped just 1%, compared with May of last year. That's much better than condo activity for all of Florida; statewide, condo sales plunged by 28%, and prices fell 4% over the same period.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For single-family homes in the West Palm Beach-Boca Raton area, sales were down sharply and prices, slightly. But the Florida statewide numbers were even worse (see chart).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The inventories (in West Palm Beach-Boca Raton) are at an all- time high," says Clark Toole, CEO of Coldwell Banker's Florida operations. "Things are selling, but they have to be priced correctly, and that may be something that was a 2003 price."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, homes priced above $1 million in the area are "holding their own," he says. "People in that category may not be affected by, say, rising gas prices."   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Don't expect any quick rebound in housing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that its index of pending sales -- which tracks contracts that have been signed but not closed -- fell 3.5% in May to 97.7 from the previous month and was down more than 13% from year-ago levels.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' senior economist, attributed the continuing weakness to tighter lending standards following climbing foreclosures in the subprime mortgage sector, as well as lack of buyer confidence. Federal regulators last week announced tougher guidelines for subprime loans, targeted at consumers with poor credit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some transactions are being postponed from mortgage market disruptions," Yun said. "But better-supervised lending will put housing in a fundamentally healthier state over the long term."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' report is the latest bit of data -- following recent reports showing new home sales down 16% from last year and existing home sales also down by double digits -- that housing remains a drag on economic growth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told Reuters that the housing correction was "at or near the bottom," though it could be some time before an upturn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Vitner, senior economist at  <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>, does not expect sales to improve in the second half of the year, and doesn't expect construction and new permits to improve until into next year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vitner says the market may be close to bottoming out, but warns that at the bottom, "things are going to look their absolute worst."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You've hit bottom, but you're not out of the hole," Vitner says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' index of pending home sales rose in the West and Northeast in May, but fell in the South and Midwest. The base index reading of 100 is based on average activity in 2001, the first of five-straight years of record home sales.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market in Albany, the capital of New York, is sending mixed signals.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, for all residential sales, the volume is flat, and the median sales price is up 7%, according to the Greater Capital Association of Realtors (GCAR).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in May, the most recent month for which figures are available, sales of single-family homes fell, and prices tumbled compared with April and May of last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the recent price drops, it's still "extremely hard" to convince some sellers that they can't get last year's heyday prices in the current market, says Mary-Jo Pierpont, an agent at Coldwell Banker Prime Properties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's frustrating," Pierpont says, "because sellers feel they can still get the same price that their neighbors got in '05 and '06, and purchasers are getting the message from the media that there are still many bargains out there."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disconnect between the expectations of buyers and sellers is partly why the supply of homes on the market is up 13% from last year and why buyers are taking their time to choose.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter, the average home sat on the market for 80 days before it sold, up from 59 days, on average, for the first quarter of last year, according to GCAR.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strongest part of the market is among "move-up buyers," who are selling a home and using the equity to buy a larger home, say, in the $200,000-to-$250,000 range, Pierpont says.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With buyers jittery and mortgages harder to get, sales of existing homes fell in May to a four-year low, and the median price dipped for the 10th straight month, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no relief in sight for sellers for at least a few months, because the inventory of homes for sale has swollen to an 8.9-month supply, the highest in 15 years. Homeowners will likely have to cut prices further to entice buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market may not be in a free fall, but it has not hit bottom yet, either," says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The backlog of homes for sale is just one problem; another is psychology. As prices inch down, some would-be buyers typically become more reluctant to enter the market, figuring prices will fall further.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for an existing home -- half cost more, half, less -- fell 2.4% from a year ago, to $223,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People just don't have that confidence to enter the home-buying market, even though they have the financial capacity," says Lawrence Yun, the NAR's senior economist.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Yun also points to a surge in the number of rejected loan applications. Most major mortgage companies have raised their lending standards. They're demanding that buyers show higher credit scores, solid jobs, bigger down payments and reserves in the bank.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stricter loan rules have followed a record number of loans entering foreclosure, a result of loose lending standards during the real estate boom.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Yun still thinks the housing market will rebound by year's end, much will depend on mortgage rates, which have crept up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Federal Reserve policymakers meet this week, they're expected to hold interest rates steady, partly because real estate continues to be a drag on the economy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Fed changes rates, the ripple effect can affect mortgages.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales last month eked out a seasonally adjusted pace of 5.99 million, nearly flat from April and off about 10% from May of last year. For single-family homes, sales fell 11% from a year ago; condo sales were off about 7%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department will release new-home sales figures today, and Stuart Hoffman, chief economist for  <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services</span>, expects a "sharp decline."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey of home builders last week showed their confidence had plunged to its lowest since 1991. Buyers are still canceling orders, despite promises of free pools, landscaping and other upgrades.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't expect (the housing market) to hit bottom for at least another year," Hoffman says.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything is relative. Home sales this year in Olympia, the capital of Washington, don't look so hot compared with last year. But they're actually some of the best on record.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the local real estate market peaked in spring of 2006, the most recent figures present "an unfortunate comparison against an extremely robust year," says Jerry Wilkins, manager of the Olympic MLS, which maintains a property sales database that includes mostly existing homes but some newly built ones, too.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a six-month supply of homes now for sale, most agents would say it's a balanced market. The average home sells in 78 days. "Buyers that have sat on the sidelines," Wilkins says, "are starting to get into the market."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom years, prices in Olympia were rising an average of about 25% a year. But so far this year (January through May), the median single-family home price is up only about 5% compared with the first five months of last year, Wilkins says. Meantime, sales for that period have declined about 14%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The properties that are moving tend to be the properties that are priced well and show well," says Gregory Moe, an agent at  <span class="companylink">Windermere Real Estate</span> Olympia. "There is a lot of competition with new construction. Almost half of the listings are new construction."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though a rush-hour commute to Seattle can last up to two hours each way, Moe says, plenty of buyers who work in Seattle opt for Olympia because of the lower cost of living and more affordable homes.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction ran 6/13/2007: The population for the Kansas City metro region, which includes people living in both Kansas and Missouri, is about 1.97 million. The figure in Tuesday's Close to Home column was incorrect. On the map, the state of Missouri should also have been shaded.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kansas City real estate market is divided by the Kansas- Missouri state line, but it functions as a single housing market. So the figures here, from the Kansas City Regional Association of Realtors, include sales from both sides of the border.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market seems to be recovering from a bottom it hit in January. The Kansas City metro area, with a population of about 1.1 million, never experienced the torrid sales pace that much of the East and West Coasts did during the recent housing boom. Sales did hit a cyclical peak last June but then fell. Sales have risen for the past four months. And sales of existing homes were up 1% in April compared with April last year, though the average price fell about 1%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For newly built homes, sales were down 18% in April compared with April 2006, but the average price rose nearly 7% to $282,990.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had a little optimistic building" by developers, says Diane Ruggiero, CEO of the local association of Realtors. There was a 10.4- month supply of new homes on the market in April, down from the peak of 15.9 months at the start of the year. For existing homes, there was a 6.8-month supply, up from March but down from an 8.6-month inventory in January.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are two differences in our market than (five years ago)," Ruggiero says. "One is bigger inventory, two is more agents. In 2001, we had 6,500 agents in this region. Now, we have a little over 10,000. There's a huge growth in the number of people coming into the business."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "hippie invasion" of Taos occurred in the late 1960s, according to the timeline on the Taos County Historical Society's website. This small town, with a population of about 5,000, still has a funky edge and a relatively low bling factor, despite a few part-time residents like Julia Roberts and Lauren Hutton.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Taos began evolving about six years ago as condos sprang up and baby boomers (no longer in tie-dyed T-shirts) started buying second homes to enjoy the nearby skiing and outdoor lifestyle, says Harvey Blaustein, owner of a local realty firm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About one-third of home sales now are condos, Blaustein says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for single-family homes, meantime, has slowed considerably. Sales in the first quarter were down 15%, and in April they were off 50%. Prices held up in the first three months of the year, but in April the median price dipped 8.6%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes here are also taking longer to sell. Even last year, when the market was stronger, homes for sale sat on the market for an average 257 days before a buyer came along.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Monterey area is more developed and diverse now than when John Steinbeck wrote Cannery Row in 1945, and that's reflected in the changing real estate market. The traditional farming region of Salinas has exploded with new development, not only to keep up with the growing population but also to house middle-class families who can no longer afford the still-rising home prices in the coastal towns.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in Monterey are declining, though, as they are throughout California. Many of the new homes in Salinas are sitting vacant, and more homes are being seized by lenders through foreclosure, says Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the California Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't be fooled, she says, by the 12% increase in the median home price in April. In some areas, prices are falling, but the median price -- half the homes cost more, half cost less -- is rising because of strength in the top end of the market. Wealthy buyers, who are largely unaffected by interest rates, gas prices or rising property taxes, are continuing to purchase second and retirement homes in tony areas such as Carmel and Pebble Beach.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes soared to a seasonally adjusted rate of 981,000 last month -- up an eye-popping 16% from March -- the Commerce Department said Thursday. But don't release the balloons just yet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's too soon to celebrate a turnaround in the real estate market, despite news that new-home sales in April posted their biggest surge in 14 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers last month were buoyed by sunny weather in the South and aggressive price-cutting by builders. April's rosy results are expected to fade next month, when government number-crunchers revise the data. Though the price cuts should continue to help the new- home market, lots of new homes are still sitting empty. And whatever strength exists in the market is mainly in the low end, where homes remain more affordable for middle-class buyers. Heavy buying of modestly priced homes pulled the overall median price down 11% from April 2006, to $229,100.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The margin of error in these numbers is massive -- plus or minus 13 (percentage points)," says Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics. "One big monthly change in either direction does not make a trend."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The April figures also contradict the pessimistic mood and financial results of many big builders. The National Association of Home Builders' index of builder confidence fell in May to its lowest since September. Contract cancellations have been creeping back up as mortgage lenders tighten credit standards. As a result, buyers are having more trouble getting loans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The signals I'm getting from the big companies, from their experience in April, I'd say things are still moving downward," said David Seiders, chief economist for the NAHB.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Toll Bros. said Thursday that its profit plunged nearly 80% in its fiscal second quarter, largely because the luxury-home builder had to write down the value of its land holdings. The company also said it can't provide earnings estimates for the year because it's too difficult to predict the market right now.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, though, bright spots where there are "glimmers of strength," said Toll CEO Robert Toll, including the New York metro area, Philadelphia suburbs, Delaware, Austin and Dallas, and the Silicon Valley area of Northern California.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for the nation as a whole, most economists still don't expect the real estate market to recover until the end of the year, or later.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Baron, founder of the Baron Funds investment company, has paid a record $103 million for a residential property in East Hampton, N.Y. And get this: That price doesn't even include the cost of the house he wants to build.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price -- equal to what Texas plans to spend on border security this year -- tops a record set in 2004, when Revlon Chairman Ronald Perelman sold his estate in Palm Beach, Fla., for $70 million to Dwight Schar of builder NVR.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Baron's bragging rights might not last long. Three homes -- well, estates -- for sale are asking even dizzier prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, real estate baron (with a small b) Tim Blixseth boasted that he'd start building the world's most expensive house. His $155 million asking price tops the high of $149 million for Updown Court in Windlesham, England, still on the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's amazing how much growth there is in the very high end of the market in terms of wealth," says Rick Goodwin, publisher of Ultimate Homes magazine.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall in the USA, home sales slid 8.4% last year, in part because prices in many areas had climbed out of reach for the middle class. But for residences priced at $5 million or more, sales soared 18% for 2006 and 31% in the first quarter of this year -- both record highs, according to  <span class="companylink">DataQuick.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Properties over $10 million are becoming very commonplace," says Jonathan Miller of Miller Samuel, a Manhattan appraiser. "When you compare it to the national median, which is hovering around $215,000, there's a lot of disparity."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blixseth envisions his project, called The Pinnacle at Yellowstone Club, in Big Sky, Mont., as a 32,000-square-foot home on 160 acres. He says it will include an 8,000-bottle wine cellar, a 26- seat cinema, a hair and nail salon, a private gondola to ski lifts, a fleet of Suburban SUVs for the underground garage, and a helipad with pilot's quarters.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Baron, his 40 acres of oceanfront property are vacant. He bought the land from Adelaide de Menil, heiress to the Schlumberger oil fortune, and her husband, Ted Carpenter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four antique houses had stood on the property. But the sellers donated them to the town, which moved the buildings and plans to use them as a new town hall.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baron declined to comment on the deal, which was hush-hush and sold without a broker, says Judi Desiderio of Town &amp; Country Real Estate in East Hampton, who confirmed the sale and price.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices extended their decline in the first three months of the year, but the nation's housing market seems to be stabilizing and is likely to recover slowly in the second half of 2007, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of an existing single-family home was $212,300 in the first quarter, down 1.8% from the January-March period a year ago. It was the third quarter in a row in which prices fell. But the drop wasn't as severe as the one in the fourth quarter of 2006, when the median price fell 2.7%. (Median means half are higher and half are lower.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It appears the worst of the price correction is behind us," said Pat Combs, the NAR's president.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the first quarter was better than the end of 2006, the NAR said last month it was surprised by a sudden weakening in March.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales from February to March plunged 8.4%, the sharpest month-to- month fall in 18 years, causing the NAR to conclude that the correction had hit a new low.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the NAR's senior economist, says he's waiting to see how stricter lending rules, especially for those with weak, or subprime, credit, will hit the market. "We know it's going to make home buying softer, but how much?"   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot, home builders say. An index of builder confidence fell this month to the lowest level since September, the National Association of Home Builders said Tuesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're now projecting that home sales and housing production will not begin improving until late this year, and we're expecting the early stages of the subsequent recovery to be quite sluggish," David Seiders, the NAHB's chief economist, said in a statement.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, existing-home prices rose in 82 metro areas in the first quarter, better than in the final three months of last year, when 71 areas saw rising prices. Prices fell in 62 areas. The strongest gain was in the Cumberland area of Maryland and West Virginia, where the median price jumped 17% to $100,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next-biggest price gains were posted by the Beaumont-Port Arthur area of Texas, up 16.5%, and by Gulfport-Biloxi, Miss., where the median price surged 15.7%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The USA's least-expensive area remains Elmira, N.Y., which also suffered the steepest price drop in the quarter, down nearly 15% to $75,300. The next-sharpest price losers were the Sarasota-Bradenton area of Florida, with the median price off 12%, and New Orleans, where the median dropped 10.9%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Jose-Santa Clara-Sunnyvale area of California is still the costliest, with a median home price of $788,000, up 4.4% from the first quarter of 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With lots of high-paying tech jobs at such companies as  <span class="companylink">Google</span> and Yahoo, "There's just a lot of income there," says Paul Conti of Re/Max Valley Properties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEXT OF INFO BOX BEGINS HERE   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No region immune   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price fell in all four regions of the country:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USA $212,300 1.8%   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northeast $286,900 2.5%   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo sales have propped up residential real estate in the nation's capital this year. Fueled by new development, condo sales surged nearly 23% for the first four months of the year. Sales of condos accounted for a hefty 54% of the market, up from 46% in the first four months last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with so many condos flooding the market, prices have begun to drop. The median condo price in the District of Columbia in April was $350,000, 4% lower than last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers "built a lot of condos in a relatively short period of time," says Vanessa de Merode, an agent at  <span class="companylink">Long &amp; Foster.</span> "It slowed the market down. There were larger price adjustments."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, purchases of single-family homes dropped by about 11% through April, though the median home price posted a decent gain. That's thanks, in part, to one of the strongest segments: homes priced from $800,000 to $900,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring selling season, though, continues to look weaker than last year's. The inventory of homes for sale has swelled by about 8%, and homes and condos are taking longer to sell: 73 days, on average, vs. 53 days last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The length of days on market reflects that some things are still not priced correctly," says Brenda Small, president of the Greater Capital Area Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eunice Reddick and Marc Wall; Harvey Shulman and Eric Mugele; Robert Coonrod and Martha Johnston; and Chai and Kanitta Meesook are selling their four single-family homes as one property and plan to divide the sale price four ways. The original house (upper left corner) was built in the 1940s, the other homes in 1992. Combined, the four lots total about 1 acre in a cul-de-sac.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market in Cheyenne, the capital of Wyoming, took off during the real estate boom and is only now showing slight signs of slowing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales from January to March were up more than 6% compared with the first quarter of last year, and prices rose 4%. "We have not had a down year for the past five years," says Bill Lewis, an agent at #1 Properties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, though, Lewis says, homes for sale have been staying on the market a little longer, and some sellers are having to cut their asking prices a bit. The average single-family home that sold in March had been on the market just over three months, about a month longer than last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheyenne's real estate market is insulated from most national trends in part because the local economy enjoys a stable employment base. The F.E. Warren Air Force Base is the largest employer, followed by the state and local governments. Union Pacific railroad is the largest private employer in the city.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area also tends to attract new businesses with its favorable tax structure: Property taxes in Cheyenne are among the lowest of metro areas nationwide. And Wyoming has no state or local corporate tax or personal income tax.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new cars and trucks skidded last month as would-be buyers were hit by increases in variable-rate mortgages and falling home values, leaving them nowhere to go for cheap car-buying cash.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gasoline prices that jumped an average 29 cents a gallon nationwide last month chilled some of the remaining buying enthusiasm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, automakers sold 7.6% fewer new vehicles in April than they did a year earlier. There were two fewer business days this April, however. Adjusted for that, sales were up a minuscule 0.1%, Autodata says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Pipas, sales analyst at  <span class="companylink">Ford Motor</span>, says the industrywide sales sag "raises a level of concern about whether consumers will be as resilient as they have been in the past." More income "is being tapped by higher and higher gas prices and weaker housing prices."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There definitely is a connection," says Rajeev Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at the Robinson College of Business at Georgia State University. "As the housing market is softening up, home-equity loan growth has slowed."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-equity loan or credit-line payments are lower than most auto- loan payments due to longer payback times and, often, lower rates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Biggest surprises:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*DaimlerChrysler, alone among major automakers, reported a sales increase: up 1.2%, as sales of Chrysler's heavily discounted minivans and redesigned Jeep Wrangler line made up for a decline in Mercedes-Benz sales.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The van deals "were pretty strong," and early spring is "van season," says Keith Kampen, sales manager at Dave Mungenast's Alton Dodge in Alton, Ill.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*The three big Japanese automakers all had lower sales. It was the first time highflying Toyota had a sales drop-off since May 2005, when the entire industry looked bad in comparison with a strong month in 2004.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toyota sales, including Lexus and Scion, were off 4.3%. But adjusted for fewer selling days this April, Toyota was up 3.7%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of its Prius hybrid jumped 58.6%, fueled by gasoline- price increases and good inventory.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has hit a new bottom, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday after reporting that sales of existing homes fell 8.4% in March from February, the sharpest drop in 18 years and an alarming sign for the spring season.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This was very disappointing," said David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist, who said the new figures have led him to revise his outlook downward. "There's no way you can spin this news." Lereah had previously said the housing market bottomed out in September and was starting to recover. Now, he says he expects "sluggish" sales in April, May and June. And he projects that the market won't recover until the third quarter of the year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are not even that optimistic.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect home sales to drop nearly 10% in the coming months, before turning around in the first half of 2008," said Patrick Newport, chief U.S. economist for Global Insight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harsh winter weather kept some home shoppers indoors. But the bigger problem for many potential buyers is that they couldn't get a loan. Lenders, startled by the many people with adjustable-rate mortgages who have defaulted, have been tightening the standards to qualify for a loan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worst hit are buyers with little cash for a down payment, or with low, or "subprime," credit scores.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've got at least one or two home buyers a week who can't get a loan but would have had one six months ago," says Pava Leyrer of Heritage National Mortgage in Grandville, Mich.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mequon, Wis., "at least 30% of the subprime people I'm dealing with who want to buy a home, I can't help," says John Stearns of Robbins and Lloyd Mortgage. "I'm telling them to build their credit up."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With fewer buyers qualifying, homes are sitting longer. At the current sales rate, there's a 7.3-month supply -- the most since October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales last month fell to a seasonally adjusted pace of 6.12 million, the largest decline since January 1989. The weakness came from sales of single-family homes, which dropped 9.5% from February.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price (half sold for more, half less) edged down for the eighth-consecutive month, to $217,000, off 0.3% from March of last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slower home sales, higher gas prices and consumer pessimism, pose threats to the overall economy, warns Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. "We don't have a bottom in housing; we don't have a top in gas prices," Naroff says. "That doesn't bode well for growth going forward."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property taxes will keep rising nearly everywhere for homeowners even as house prices are falling in many parts of the country, according to a USA TODAY analysis of government data.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key reason: Despite the downturn, the market value of millions of homes still exceeds their assessed value used for tax purposes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some people are irritated to learn the news," says Jim Todora, a property tax assessor in Sarasota County, Fla. "Their home's value may have gone down, but their property tax is still going up."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresh evidence of the slumping real estate market came Tuesday when the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes dropped in March at the highest rate in 18 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property tax limits were passed to prevent big increases during times of soaring home values. Those laws let assessments rise, slowly but steadily, until they reach market value.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property taxes from homeowners and businesses go mostly to local governments, paying for schools, roads, police and other services. Collections rose 7% last year to a record $377 billion, although the median home price climbed just 1% nationwide and fell in many places. The disconnect is likely to continue.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All but five states limit how quickly property taxes can rise. After a decade of soaring housing prices, it can take years for a home's tax value to catch up to its market value, even with the current dip.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the long run, property tax limits save homeowners money. Clark County, Nev., Treasurer Laura Fitzpatrick would owe $4,781 in taxes on her Las Vegas house if it were assessed at market value. Instead, she'll pay $3,036. "Those are big savings, even if this year my taxes went up more than the value of my house," she says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reasons few tax bills will shrink:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Higher tax rates. Many local governments where home values have softened -- including the Washington, D.C., suburbs of Northern Virginia -- are increasing tax rates to offset lower assessments. The city of Fairfax, Va., for example, plans to raise its tax rate by 4.5% to offset a 3% decline in house values.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Delayed assessments. Property taxes often are based on market values that are several years old. New Hampshire revalues property once every five years, most recently in 2006 when prices peaked.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People read about how the market has crashed," says Polk County Assessor Jim Maloney in Des Moines. "But that change doesn't show up for a long time."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the few who may benefit from falling values: people who bought recently at the market peak, only to see prices drop.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ventura County, Calif., is looking at 20,000 home sales since the end of 2005 to see whether any owners deserve a tax cut. The median home price in Ventura County is $567,000, down 5% from its peak in March 2006, according to  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, which tracks prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To get a tax cut, you have to buy a home at the peak and have it lose value quickly," says Ventura County Assessor Dan Goodwin. "You can't enjoy double-digit increases in your home value and then expect a tax cut when the market dips."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in Windsor County, Vt., which is best known for the affluent town of Woodstock, got off to a slow start this year. The winter ski season, which often attracts vacation-home buyers, was a bust until snow finally covered the mountains in mid-February, says Phil Dodd, publisher of the Vermont Property Owners Report newsletter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in the first three months of the year were off more than 20%, but that was probably in part because second-home buyers -- who generally don't have to buy or sell -- tend to be more sensitive to uncertainties in the real estate market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though prices are still rising slightly, buyers in the market now are being "very aggressive," says Joanne Kent, an agent at Lang McLaughry Spera. They are making low offers and asking for a lot of concessions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a house is priced right, though, "We are getting multiple offers," Kent says.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market in Sarasota, Fla., had a huge growth spurt during the real estate boom, but it hit the brakes in spring of last year. The median price for a single-family home was down 18% in the fourth quarter compared with the same quarter of 2005, the biggest drop of any metro area, according to the National Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of the boom, "People were buying sight unseen," says Russ Marquardt, an agent at Re/Max Properties in Sarasota. "It's not similar to that now by any means, but I would say our marketing is more attuned to what it was before the land rush. I'm thinking that we're getting closer and closer to normal."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sarasota's main attractions, of course, are the warm weather and white sandy beaches. The city, on the southwest coast of Florida about 50 miles south of Tampa, has a population of about 55,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though home sales are not on par with recent years, the market is still growing. These days, Marquardt says, home sellers are more willing to negotiate, and buyers are out shopping for homes in good neighborhoods that might have been unaffordable before. On a recent weekend, he says, he held an open house, and 21 people came - - a good sign for this year's spring selling season.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built on the Mississippi River, Vicksburg is known for its casino gambling boats and its rich Civil War history. The housing market, which was solid the past two years, seems to have stalled since the start of the year, says George McMillin, owner of McMillin Real Estate &amp; Appraisals.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's little sign of a spring selling season, and the supply of homes on the market is thin, McMillin says. "People are just not moving right now."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He describes this city of about 26,000 residents as "a stable market, not much growth in it. No new industries coming in to speak of ... no great influx of new buyers or building of new homes, because there's no demand for it."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it's an affordable place to live; the median home price is about half the national median. Homes priced from $120,000 to $160,000 move the fastest, McMillin says. On average, a home for sale stays on the market just over five months.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's home builders are scaling back their construction plans for the year, and a report Monday provided the clearest sign to date why: Sales of new homes plunged in February to their lowest point in nearly seven years, the Commerce Department said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Snow and frigid weather kept some buyers indoors last month. But builders are growing more pessimistic about the spring selling season, the National Association of Home Builders says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for their grim outlook: Mortgage lenders, shaken by the rising number of loan defaults, are making it harder for potential buyers with tarnished, or "subprime," credit to qualify.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downward sales trend "is pretty serious stuff," David Seiders, chief economist for the home builders association, said in an interview Monday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seiders said he was surprised by the fall in sales and by a downward revision in January's sales numbers. "The weakening pattern (in new home sales) is convincing, meaning it's not special factors like the weather; it's something fundamental," he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One in three builders said tighter loan standards have already hurt sales this year, a NAHB survey this month showed. (Half those builders said stricter rules had eroded sales by up to 10%.) When the NAHB questioned a sample of large builders, Seiders said, it found "unambiguous signals that this is something serious."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes, which fell 21% last year, could take another pounding this year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've been sitting here with a pencil and eraser working on our forecast," Seiders said. "I started out two weeks ago expecting about a 2% decline for new-home sales this year. Now, I've got them down 8%, and I'm not sure that's enough" of a cut.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes last month fell to a seasonally adjusted pace of 848,000, down nearly 4% from January and about 18% from February 2006. Business was off drastically in all regions except the West, where sales rose nearly 25%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anxious about how the slowdown will affect the industry and the broader economy, investors dumped shares of builders and lenders Monday.  <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, Centex, Lennar and Countrywide Financial all took a hit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One group of observers may be pleased, though, by the sputtering new home market: would-be buyers. They can now choose from an 8.1- month supply of new homes -- the highest level since 1991. Many builders aren't just cutting prices; they're also throwing in free granite countertops and swimming pools to entice buyers. The median new home price in February was $250,000, down 0.3% from a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The backlog of homes for sale is troubling to economists, such as Phillip Neuhart at Wachovia. "Inventory continues to be a serious risk to the market," he says.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With only about 60,000 residents on the island of Kauai, the direction of its housing market can seem to change with the tropical winds. Take January, when the sale of just a few high-end homes boosted the median price by 31%. By comparison, the median home price last year was up 5.6% from 2005. And home sales, which fell 8.3% in January, were off 29% last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo sales were down 67% in January, the most recent month for which figures are available. Yet the median price of $455,000 was up nearly 6%. Condos account for about one-third of the housing market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the middle of last year, there was a very big slowdown," says Neal Norman, owner of Koa Properties. "Everyone started panicking. But by the end of the year, things started turning around."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With little land available for new development, real estate in Kauai may well be a good long-term investment. Last year, the housing market near the commercial center of Koloa fared the best, but the Hanalei north coast is the "hip place" to buy if you can afford it, Norman says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy is deeply dependent on the 1 million tourists who visit each year. But the filming of a big-budget movie can also make a difference. This summer, film crews will arrive for the making of Tropic Thunder, a war movie being directed by Ben Stiller and starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kauai is also popular with movie stars looking for vacation homes. Bette Midler and Pierce Brosnan are among the part-time residents. And veteran Hollywood producer Peter Guber (whose credits include Rain Man and The Color Purple) is selling his estate -- currently the most expensive on the market.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 10% drop in home sales in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area at the start of the year was actually good news. The area's housing market looked even worse at the end of 2006, according to the Minnesota Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in 2007 are expected to be "pretty much on par with last year, maybe starting to recover at the end of the year, meaning (sales) will be up a little bit," says Chris Galler, senior vice president of the association.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Twin Cities area enjoyed double-digit price appreciation from 2000 to 2002, after which price increases slowed to the single digits. Last year, home prices rose about 4.5%, Galler said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes priced below $250,000 are selling well; the market in the southwest suburbs is the healthiest in the area. But those who expect to sell need to keep their homes well-maintained.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People aren't willing to spend that much money anymore for properties that need work," Galler notes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents are concerned, though, about the many homes in foreclosure, as well as investor-owned homes that are sitting vacant and for sale. Not only are homes in foreclosure often in disrepair, which depresses property prices, they're also typically sold below market prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are working with a group to try to track the problem," Galler says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the homeowners in default appear to have low incomes and carry high-interest loans geared toward borrowers with shaky credit.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just an hour's train ride to Grand Central Station in New York City makes New Canaan, Conn., effectively a wealthy suburb for Manhattan's moneyed class, including JetBlue CEO David Neeleman. There were only six home sales in January, but the median price was - - cha-ching! -- $2 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, even this area was not completely immune to the slump in residential real estate. Sales last year were down nearly 16%, and prices slipped 3%, according to the Connecticut Multiple Listing Service.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condominium market was hit even harder. Condo sales were down 30%, and the average sales price dropped 12% to $675,033.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rebounded in January, reaching the highest level in seven months, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The warm winter weather helped boost sales, which rose 3%. And single-family homes showed the biggest sales increase, rising 3.5%. But existing condominiums and cooperative housing sales slipped 0.1%. Those sales are stagnant because many more condos and co-ops are available, the NAR says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the dramatic rise in home sales in January, no one should overreact to the gain, analysts say. "I'm trying to be careful because we could see the next month down a little," says David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason: February winter storms disrupted much of the country, which could cause a near-term home sales dip.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales jumped in January, there was still a downturn in existing home prices. Last month, prices fell 3.1% from January 2006 to $210,600. And the price softness is expected to continue until spring, Lereah says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But that may not be that bad," says Joel Naroff, chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors. "The decline in prices is helping sales, but we still have too many homes for sale."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes for sale rose 2.9% at the end of January to 3.55 million. That represents a 6.6-month supply. Still, that's down from the 7.4-month peak in October.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some owners may remove their homes from the market because of the additional decline in home prices , Naroff says. It also may spur more offers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the USA, existing home sales in January improved the most in the West, while sales in the Northwest were unchanged.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And among states and cities, recent sales have varied. For example, in Florida, sales fell 27% in January. But Long Island, N.Y., Boston, Pittsburgh and most of New Jersey had solid gains in home sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many experts hope that home sales will continue to improve.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"First-time home buyers are now in a position that they can take their time, and they're being able to purchase homes," says Bill Hanley, president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors. Instead of 10 buyers for every home, there are now 10 homes for every buyer, he says. At Hanley's firm, Weichert Realtors in Metuchen N.J., January home sales more than doubled the sales in January a year ago.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market in Annapolis seems to be recovering from last year's slump, though it's still too early to say for sure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales and prices both fell in December, but Lee Hatfield of Coldwell Banker Annapolis Plaza says, "We've seen a turnaround the last two to three weeks," with more showings and offers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, Hatfield recalls, last year "started great and really fizzled in the second half."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One sign that the market is strengthening is the shrinking inventory of homes for sale. About 3,080 homes are on the market in the capital of Maryland. That's about a 4.8-month supply based on the current sales rate and is an improvement over last summer's seven-month backlog.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength of the sales, though, depends on the price range. Homes priced under $200,000 are going fast; there's only a three- month supply on the market. By contrast, if you're looking for an estate above $2.5 million, there's 20 months' worth of inventory.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Micki Kirk, an agent at Re/Max Leading Edge, says some sellers are "definitely still in denial" about what their homes are worth in today's market. But, she says, "Buyers are coming in and asking for enormous concessions from sellers."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kirk recently got a $275,000 bid on a home listed at $319,000; the sellers accepted with no negotiation. "Two years ago," she says, sellers "would have laughed at you if you tried to do that."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's an alarming fact about Sacramento's housing market: About one of every five existing homes on the market is a "short sale." That means the home is worth less than the value of the mortgage, and the lender is willing to accept less than full repayment of the loan to avoid foreclosure, says Tracey Saizan, president of the Sacramento Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, in turn, puts pressure on the remaining 80% of sellers, who have equity in their homes, to cut prices. The median price in the state capital, one of the most overheated metro areas during the real estate boom, fell 4.3% in December compared with December 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sellers are having to give concessions and cut prices," Saizan says. "It's all about making the house show the best it can and aggressive pricing."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though there's only a 4.3-month supply of homes for sale -- a bit lower than the long-term average -- that figure doesn't include the 3.5-month stock of unsold new homes that are also on the market, especially in some suburbs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales in the fourth quarter were up nearly 57%, but that was compared with a dismal quarter at the end of 2005, according to The Gregory Group, a new home information and consulting firm. The median new home price fell 4.7% to $434,990, which doesn't take account of all the free goodies that builders are giving away, such as kitchen upgrades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, builders are now seeing a decline in the number of buyers who are canceling their purchase contracts. "There is a sense that we are going through the tunnel, and the light at the other end is sunshine, not another train heading at us," says Greg Paquin of The Gregory Group.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are likely to spring back in the coming months, the National Association of Realtors predicted Thursday after reporting that median prices fell in 73 metro areas in the final three months of 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year "was the year of contraction," said David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist. "When we get the figures for this spring, I expect to see a discernible improvement in both sales and prices."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in an overall sluggish fourth quarter, 71 areas had price gains, the NAR said. And 14 of those areas saw double-digit year- over-year percentage gains.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At least the bottom appears to have already occurred," says Lawrence Yun, an NAR economist. "It looks like the figures will be improving. Whether or not that will be sustainable is a different question."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the median sales price for an existing single-family home fell to $219,300 in the fourth quarter, down 2.7% from the same period in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several once-sizzling markets in Florida continued to see price declines. The Sarasota-Bradenton-Venice area was worst hit; prices fell 18% in the fourth quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the NAR pointed out that despite the recent downturn in prices, gains for typical single-family homes the past five years have been robust in many metro areas -- and explosive in others. In Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif., for example, prices have soared 155.3% in the past five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other parts of California have yet to benefit. In the inland areas, many builders who are struggling to move new-home inventory have caused prices to fall sharply, says Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist of the California Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such price drops, though, are starting to lure buyers, a trend that could help lift the overall housing market. "Buyers are responding to seller pricing and incentives, and there's pent-up demand as a result of buyer hesitation in the second half of 2006," says Pat Vredevoogd Combs, the NAR's president.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the areas that reported the biggest gains at the end of last year was Atlantic City, which saw a 25.9% jump in home prices in the fourth quarter, compared with the same period in 2005. And Trenton-Ewing, N.J., enjoyed an 18.9% rise in prices. It could post even better results this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Interest rates remain extremely reasonable, and the buyers are out there and they're buying; they're not just shopping," says Rosalie Daniels, broker-owner of RE/Max TriCounty in Hamilton Township, on the outskirts of Trenton. Written contracts for home sales in January 2007, Daniels says, are 35% ahead of the pace of January 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates should also help boost sales. The average 30- year fixed rate for 2006 was 6.40%; it's now 6.30%, Freddie Mac said Thursday.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta has a saturated 11.2-month supply of homes and condos for sale, up from a 7.2-month inventory in December last year. That's the main reason prices are flat and homes are taking longer to sell, says Mike Wright of the Atlanta Board of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homes are being sold by lenders who took over the properties because the owners couldn't or didn't pay their mortgages. "A lot of Atlanta's resale inventory is coming from foreclosures," Wright says. (The median-price home pictured this week, chosen at random, is one of them.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Atlanta, unfortunately, had been for a good number of years the No.1 mortgage fraud market in the U.S.," Wright says. Though lenders and regulators are now "getting a handle on it, we are suffering through foreclosures related to that."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta was No.3 on the list of mortgage fraud hot spots in 2005, the last year for which figures are available, according to the Mortgage Asset Research Institute.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For condos, whose average sale price exceeded $200,000 in December for the first time, there are worries that overbuilding could turn the market oatmeal-soft.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's certainly concern too much new condo product is coming on board," Wright says. "The good news is a lot of the projects, probably a dozen, announced in 2006 are now on hold."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point last year, developers collectively had plans for 100 condo units priced at more than $3 million.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After five years of blockbuster home sales, 2006 delivered a reality check for homeowners in Tucson. Sales of single-family homes skidded 33% from 2005, and price appreciation last year dropped to 8%, down from nearly 27% in 2005, according to DataQuick Information Systems.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a hefty 9.5-month supply of homes for sale, about 3,000 homeowners took their homes off the market last year. An additional 3,700 homes sat on the market so long that the listing agreements (which typically last three to six months) expired with the homes unsold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a sure indication that some sellers have unrealistic goals or have been given poor advice when bringing their property to market," according to a year-end report by Long Cos., a Tucson real estate firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"December was a little quiet, and 2006 was definitely a time of adjustment here," says Martha Briggs, an agent at Long Realty. But last year's sales figures were on par with the 2000-03 period; they "only look terrible in comparison with 2005."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Housing is proving to be one of the biggest wild cards in the economy in 2007 as analysts are deeply divided about whether the worst in the downturn is over or there is much more pain to go.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 9% of economists say the housing decline ended in 2006, according to a USA TODAY survey of 55 economists taken Jan. 18-24. Another 42% said the downturn will end in the first half of the year, and 45% said housing will bottom out in the second half.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is one of those hot-button issues," says Christopher Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. He estimates the downturn ended last year. "I don't know why people are so pessimistic."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When housing bottoms out is key for the economy. Thus far, the fallout has been small. The economy grew at a faster pace in 2006 than in 2005 even though sales of previously owned homes fell 8.2%, the biggest drop in 17 years, the National Association of Realtors says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the economy may not be able to shrug off further declines, A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons chief economist Gary Thayer says. Lower energy prices and a strong job market have thus far helped consumers weather the housing downturn. But going forward, those two factors may not be big enough to offset further weakening, Thayer says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Seeing things stabilize and hearing reports that housing is stabilizing is good for consumer confidence," he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's index of pending home sales, which is adjusted for seasonal variations, rose in December at the fastest pace since March 2004. The level of unsold homes on the market appeared to have peaked in July, the group says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Wachovia senior economist Mark Vitner says although recent housing data have been upbeat, they have been skewed by warmer-than- usual weather.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That brought out a few more buyers and allowed for more building in the Northeast," he says. Vitner says the warm weather "pulled sales forward." Come spring, housing activity will be slower than normal, he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I haven't met a home builder yet who thinks things have bottomed out," he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economist Tucker Hart Adams says the housing market won't stabilize in 2007. The combination of resetting adjustable-rate mortgages, homeowners unable to keep up with payments on so-called exotic mortgages such as interest-only loans, and other debt will lead to higher foreclosure rates and more homes on the market, she says. "It's really optimistic to think that it just took a little adjustment and everything is fine," she says. "It's one time I would like to be wrong."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes slid 8.4% last year, the steepest fall in 17 years, but the market probably hit bottom in September and is entering a slow recovery that will last until June, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One sign the market could revive this year is that the median home price, which had fallen for four months, was unchanged at $222,000 in December and was up 1.1% for all of 2006. And though it's still a buyer's market in most of the USA, the 7.3-month glut of homes for sale in November shrank to 6.8 months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It looks like we are on the bottom, and we will be scraping bottom as we move along," said David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist. "The worst is over for existing-home sales, but I'm still troubled about new homes."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department will release new-home sales today. Those sales are expected to be down 17% for 2006 and to fall a further 9.7% this year, Lereah says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone is ready to herald the end of the correction for existing homes. From November to December, they note, sales fell 0.8%, ending a two-month upward trend. December sales were off 7.9% from December 2005. "It's very premature at this point to jump to the conclusion that we've turned the corner," says Brian Bethune of Global Insight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are also facing rising interest rates, which make mortgages harder for some to afford. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan crept up to 6.25% last week, the highest since early November, Freddie Mac said. Each quarter-point increase makes homes unaffordable for about 50,000 more people, Lereah said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, most economists say the bottom has probably been reached.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Is the worst behind us? Most likely," says Joel Naroff, chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors. "Are better times here? Doubtful."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the last housing correction, in 1989, sales tumbled nearly 15%. This time, an overall healthy economy is cushioning the blow.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In areas that never overheated during the boom, such as parts of Texas and North Carolina, home sales are still setting modest records. The housing markets that were the hottest -- especially Florida and California -- are where the cooling-off will take the longest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Florida, sales in December plummeted 28% from the year before, and prices dropped in five metro areas. In California, sales skidded 15%; prices were down in 13 metro areas of the state.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales last year in California, where the median-priced home costs a gasp-inducing $567,690, were the lowest in a decade. They are projected to fall a further 7% this year. Robert Kleinhenz, an economist for the California Association of Realtors, said, "I'm hopeful we'll see the bottom soon."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction ran 1/19/2007: Spirit AeroSystems, a former division of Boeing, is adding jobs in Tulsa. Tuesday's Close to Home feature mistakenly said that Boeing is hiring in the area.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the current layer of ice covering Tulsa, the real estate market there shows no sign of frost.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it's not just the oil industry that's stoking home sales and prices. American Airlines, Boeing and Whirlpool are all adding jobs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're getting quite a few move-in buyers," says Debbie Shepler, a real estate agent at ERA John Hausam.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil industry is still a leading source of jobs -- and locals still recall the oil bust in the 1980s, when property values in Tulsa fell 20% -- but the economy is diversifying, says Ron Sumner, president of the Greater Tulsa Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2006 (excluding December sales, which are not yet available), home sales rose 4.3%, and the average price was up 4.6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes on the market in November was a stable six- month supply, the same as the year before. Nationally, there's a 7.3- month inventory, 46% higher than a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tulsa, the second-largest city in Oklahoma after Oklahoma City, didn't feel much of the 2000-2005 real estate boom. But now, investors in search of real estate areas with strong growth potential are buying properties in the area, Shepler says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors represented 7.5% of those who bought properties in Tulsa last year, up from 6.8% in 2005, and more than double the level of 2000, according to First American LoanPerformance. Nationally, by contrast, investor purchases fell to 8% in 2006 from 9.5% the year before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower home prices may be a major factor in the burst of investor interest in Tulsa, Shepler says, noting, "Investors can buy three homes here for the price of one in California."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, investors can buy 4 1/2 median-price homes in Tulsa for the price of one $555,290 median-price home in California.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The University of Virginia insulates the economy and the housing market in Charlottesville from many of the national trends. Home sales this year will be the second-best on record, though still down markedly from last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's missing this year is the "ton of investor money superheating sales volume and prices," says Dave Phillips, chief executive of the Charlottesville Area Association of Realtors. That's why second-home sales are weaker this year, he explains.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo sales fell 23%, and prices were off 15% in November, compared with a year ago, but condos only accounted for about 20% of the area's sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As single-family home prices continue to rise, more residents are moving to surrounding counties, such as Greene, Fluvanna and Louisa, in search of affordable housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Louisa is the current hot spot," Phillips says. "These small, rural markets are starting to feed Charlottesville's need for residents and workers."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about 2,600 homes and condos for sale -- about a nine- month supply -- and about 500 more homes are expected to start coming on the market this month in anticipation of the spring selling season.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median-price home  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This split-level home, built in 1968, is on the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price: $315,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bedrooms: 3.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bathrooms: 2.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Size: 1,568 square feet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Features: Split foyer, hardwood floors, fireplace.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local businessman Tom Sullivan is selling this 2,500-acre Mount Pleasant property. In addition to the main residence,  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">which was built circa 1830, there are five other houses on the property, including the farm manager's  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">house. The main house has a Thomas Jefferson-style hanging balcony.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price: $28 million.  </p>
