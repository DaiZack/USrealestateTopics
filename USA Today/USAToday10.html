<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Prices and sales of previously owned homes hit records last month, according to a report out Tuesday that heightened concerns the housing market is becoming dangerously overheated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a home sold in the USA was $206,000 in April, up 6.7% from March and 15.1% from April 2004, the National Association of Realtors said. It was the first time the median price was above $200,000 and was the biggest year-over-year price gain in nearly 25 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median is the point at which half of the homes sold above and half sold below.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, meanwhile, rose 4.5% from March on a seasonally adjusted, annual basis to 7.2 million, also a record. Activity was the strongest in the South but was also up in the Midwest and Northeast. Sales were flat in the West.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report confirms the housing market is on track for another record year, again defying expectations of a slowdown, Action Economics chief economist Mike Englund says. It also suggests buyers are ignoring talk that the housing market in some parts of the country is potentially forming a dangerous bubble, which could burst.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This discussion of a bubble really doesn't seem to be influencing decisions," Englund says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data came days after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the New York Economic Club Friday that he saw "froth" in some local housing markets but discounted the notion there was a nationwide housing bubble forming, according to Bloomberg News.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenspan predicted that the large increases in home prices would soon ease. He said that although some markets could see actual price declines, most homeowners who bought before the recent run-up in prices will still likely find their houses worth more than what they paid.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has been held up in large part by rock-bottom mortgage rates, which have stayed low despite a nearly yearlong effort at the Fed to raise its target for short-term interest rates. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed mortgage was 5.86% in April, down from 5.93% in March. In April 2004, the rate was 5.83%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates typically increase as Fed officials raise interest rates. But a number of factors, including long-term expectations for low inflation, are holding down long-term bond yields, which have a greater impact on mortgage rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also continuing to propel housing have been gains in job creation in recent months. "We see all the positive factors coming together to coincide with a powerful demographic demand for housing," NAR chief economist David Lereah said in a statement.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home prices keep going up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A record number of metro areas showed double-digit appreciation in median existing-home prices from the first quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, according to the National Association of Realtors. The group's list shows 65 of 136 cities had double-digit price increases; six had modest price declines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida was the most frenzied market, with Bradenton, Sarasota and West Palm Beach-Boca Raton leading the nation in price growth. In line with recent trends, the strongest price gains were on the East and West coasts. Overall, the median existing single-family home price rose 9.7% to $188,800 in the first quarter, from $172,100 in the first quarter of 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, chief economist for the NAR says that the price gains were driven in part by tight supplies in some markets, adding that the price situation could improve next year if interest rates rise. But several economists, including members of the Federal Reserve, say the record housing market can't be explained by such factors as a growing economy, tight supply or low interest rates. They're warning that some markets are ripe for a price slowdown or fall.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought the housing market was overdone two years ago, but I think it's through the roof now in many places," says Mark Zandi of Economy.com. "I said it with lots of caveats and I wasn't screaming very loudly, but now I scream loudly. Our clients are very concerned; they're looking carefully."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is evidence of speculative buying in hot markets. Real estate firm DataQuick Information Systems at the request of USA TODAY analyzed how often buyers are flipping houses -- reselling after owning for less than six months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flipping now makes up 11.5% of current home sales in Las Vegas, compared with 2.4% five years ago. In red-hot Phoenix, quick resales are 5.2% of sales, from 2.9% five years ago. In Los Angeles, however, such activity has decreased to 4.1% from 4.3%. For the nation as a whole, the flipping figure is 3.7%, compared with 2.4% five years ago, DataQuick says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the NAR report covered existing home sales, home builders also see rising sales and prices. They expect the trend to continue, given the difficulty of buying land and clearing zoning hurdles on the coasts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Business is just as good as it's ever been. I expect it to moderate over time, but I don't expect it to come crashing down," says Steve Hilton, co-CEO of Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Meritage Homes. "Housing is a basic need; its not necessarily an elective."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers who use lower-cost Internet sites could view as many home listings as those who use traditional brokers' websites, under a deal the National Association of Realtors says it's drafting to head off a federal antitrust lawsuit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laurie Janik, the Realtors' general counsel, said Thursday that the association would no longer let home sellers and their brokers "opt out" of listing their homes on the websites of Internet-based brokerages. Sellers could still choose not to display their listings on the Internet. But the decision would have to apply to all websites, including those of traditional brokerages.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' online rivals have been pushing for the change, arguing that it would boost competition and serve consumers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR and Justice Department officials met this week to discuss how to resolve the matter. NAR's amended policies still must be authorized by its board at a meeting Saturday and accepted by the Justice Department's antitrust chief, R. Hewitt Pate. Justice officials did not return calls seeking comment Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They wanted us to come up with a new rule," says NAR spokesman Steve Cook. "That's what we're doing."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, Justice officials had asked some online brokers if they'd testify against the traditional brokers in case a lawsuit was filed. The officials saw no choice but to sue if the association didn't come up with a solution that allowed for online competition, according to two lawyers involved in the investigation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR has argued that the Realtors own their listings and that Justice was forcing them to share this information. But Justice officials have expressed concern about the influence the Realtors have over the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The officials opposed any solution that stopped short of allowing the Internet-based brokers to compete on a level playing field, according to the attorneys involved in the discussions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Web-based brokers, who tend to charge less than the 5% to 6% commissions that traditional brokers do, have complained that they can't adequately compete with off-line brokers if buyers can't see all the homes available in an area. Many traditional real estate firms are adding "virtual office websites" so they can interact with customers online, rather than only on the phone or in person.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Butters, a Chicago-based attorney for several Internet brokers, acknowledges that most consumers who receive hundreds of listings online might not know they didn't get a few dozen more that were available only to off-line brokers. But Butters says NAR had no justification to withhold listings other than the argument that "it's my listing, and I can do anything I want with it."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Reddin, CEO of RealEstate.com, a sister company to LendingTree, says he hopes NAR's solution will "open the real estate market to all forms of competition." But he lamented that there are still "disturbing trends" in barriers to competition in real estate in several states.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Pamela Harness has never seen the market this hot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix-area real estate agent's clients include a couple who made a $150,000 profit by reselling a house they held for just six months, an investor who paid more than $300,000 for a home he plans to put back on the market by year's end, and buyers facing months- long waiting lists at area home builders -- if they can even get on a list.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market here is just absolutely nuts," says Harness at West USA Realty in Chandler, Ariz. "I get investors calling; they want to buy a home. I tell them they're a day late and a dollar short at this point."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was supposed to be the year the housing sector, which has expanded at a record-setting pace since 1998 (except in 2000), started to cool. Instead, existing-home prices rose in March at the fastest pace in two decades, and new-home sales hit another peak in the first three months of the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong housing sector has buoyed the economy and local governments, through construction payrolls, increased property tax revenue and consumer spending tied to high home equity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it also has economic downsides. High prices are keeping buyers out of the market, making it harder for firms to attract workers in pricey markets and breeding high consumer debt and speculative buying.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists warn a major swath of the market is at risk of a price correction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home buyers appear to be irrationally exuberant," Jan Hatzius, economist at Goldman Sachs, said in an April report to clients, recalling Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comment about stock market investors in the 1990s. Hatzius identified frenzied coastal markets, such as Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Washington, Miami and San Francisco, as especially hot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices double in California Nationally, home prices have jumped an average 50% in the past five years, doubling in California and rising about 80% in Nevada and Hawaii, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an April USA TODAY poll of 55 top economists, three-fourths called housing overheated, though they differed on whether they expect a gradual cool-down or a sharp drop in sales and prices. Forecasts for a soft landing expect robust job creation to offset the negative effects of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those forecasts were buoyed Friday, when the government's April jobs report showed stronger-than-expected job creation. But other recent data show a somewhat softer economy than forecast, with wages lagging behind inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few economists warn of a national housing bubble, but most say local housing and job markets vary so much that a countrywide downturn is unlikely. But price reductions in big urban markets could have a broad effect on the economy. That is why there is plenty of concern about signs of speculative buying: the fact that prices are rising faster than rents, when the two usually move more closely in tandem, and price inflation that can't be justified by low rates or supply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For their part, industry officials are irritated by "sky is falling" predictions. Home builders say the current, elevated level of about 2million housing starts a year is not enough to meet higher- than-predicted household growth, fueled by immigration. Supply is tight in some areas because it can now take years to get developments approved by zoning authorities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, affluent baby boomers, rather than selling homes as they near retirement, are buying second houses. Investment homes were nearly a quarter of all purchases in 2004, and vacation homes were an additional 13%, says the National Association of Realtors (NAR).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Rassman, chief financial officer of luxury home builder Toll Bros., a publicly traded firm based in Pennsylvania, reviews the finances of recent customers every few months to gauge how well the company could weather altered economic conditions, such as an interest-rate surge. At last check, his average buyer could pay at least 38% more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I still have so many people overqualified, I should be able to sell houses as long as I've got housing in the right location," Rassman says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, an NAR survey shows affordability still in a healthy range. But in a number of cities, soaring prices are pushing not just lower-income workers but middle-class families to the sidelines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, on average, only 18% of the population could afford a median-priced home in March, according to the California Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's down 3 percentage points from a year ago. The minimum household income needed for a median-priced home, at $495,400, was $115,910 based on a 5.81% interest rate and 20% down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Montgomery County, Md., a suburb of Washington, a report by planning officials says people making the county median income of $84,446 could still afford median-priced existing town houses and condos but won't be able to in a couple of years if current trends continue. New town houses and existing homes are out of reach.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Minneapolis, where appreciation is more modest, the non- profit Family Housing Fund says lower-paid employees such as cashiers and child care workers can't afford a typical $189,000 home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245 in Walnut Creek, Calif., about 30 miles northeast of San Francisco, housing is on the agenda in coming contract talks. Union officials will press for higher pay in cities with stratospheric prices, such as San Francisco. The plan is controversial with union members who have opposed wage differences based on geography, gender or other factors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IBEW Communications Director Eric Wolfe says there is no choice because high prices are distorting the local economy. Fewer workers want jobs in expensive cities. Experienced workers with seniority rights are claiming openings in cheaper rural locations. Mass migration from pricey areas to affordable ones, dubbed the "salmon run," creates its own problems.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Like the plague in the Middle Ages, real-estate-price inflation is being spread by the people who are fleeing it," Wolfe wrote recently about the bargaining stance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another telling sign There is another telling sign of consumer stress: the growing use of alternative financing. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which carry interest rates that rise in tandem with market rates after a set period, have been setting records and now account for more than a third of recent home lending, even though rates on 30-year fixed loans remain below 6% -- lowest in decades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the subprime market -- higher-priced loans for consumers with impaired credit -- more than 80% of purchase loans are adjustable rate. So-called 2/28 products, in which an interest rate is fixed for two years, then can rise annually or semiannually, is the main subprime-purchase loan, according to David Kogut, a senior economist at mortgage giant Fannie Mae.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the website LendingTree, which connects consumers with lenders, about half the customers in the past six to nine months have opted for adjustable-rate, zero-money-down, interest-only or similar mortgages.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As rates go up higher and as real estate prices continue to firm, people will look at alternatives, and a bigger percentage of consumers will get into these non-traditional loans," says Anthony Hsieh, president of LendingTree.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk of waiting Potential buyers see warning signs of a speculative market but worry they run a bigger risk if they wait and prices jump still higher. "People have been saying for years now, 'The bubble is going to burst.' It hasn't happened, and my friends who bought three years ago have tripled the value of their property," says Bridger McGaw, 30, seeking a Washington, D.C., condo.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McGaw has lost out on several properties, including one in a bidding war that pushed the cost $70,000 over the $319,000 listing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix's Harness and Bob Waldron, a real estate agent at Coldwell Banker in Los Angeles, say buyers trying to break into the market are being hurt by speculators snapping up lower-priced homes that have more appreciation potential.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are trying to tamp down speculative buying by writing contract clauses allowing them to cancel a sale if an owner does not live in a home or to take a share of the profit if a house is quickly resold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices don't always go up. In Boston, median home prices fell 6% in the early 1990s, and were down 13% in Worcester, Mass. In New Haven, Conn., prices dropped 21% from the late 1980s through the mid-1990s. Since the late 1990s, prices and volume have moved at a heady pace, lately fueled by Fed interest-rate cuts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, a typical existing home costs 3.5 times a median family income, compared with a longstanding 2.7 ratio, according to Goldman Sachs, which says affordability is still not too bad because interest rates are low. But in hot markets on the coasts, price ratios are near peak levels of 1981 and 1989, which were followed by some sharp corrections. The earlier price-ratio peaks occurred when interest rates were at highs, not lows, however. If the price gains continue, affordability could become the worst ever in those pricey areas within the next year, the firm says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices from late 2003 to late 2004 rose 32% in Nevada, 23% in California and 23% in Washington, D.C., but less than 4% in Indiana and Ohio, according to OFHEO.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like a cake when you open (the oven door), and it sinks in the middle and gets burned around the edges. There really is not a housing bubble in the middle of the country," says David Kelly, chief economist of Putnam Investments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Kuhlmann, a real estate agent at Woods Bros. in Lincoln, Neb., tells sellers it takes 45 to 60 days to move a home. The average price for a new starter home is $165,000 to $199,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the last four months, our homes probably have been lingering a little longer. We went through a downtime, unusually," she says, adding spring sales are heating up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research says the fact that prices haven't risen as fast in parts of the Midwest and South isn't much cause for solace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is an argument there is no national market. Fine. There are regional markets where prices are sufficiently overvalued. ... They are sufficiently large that it affects the national data," says Baker, adding he thought the real estate bubble would have popped by now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown that wasn't For a time late last year, it looked as though the long-predicted slowdown was arriving. Katherine Race Brin, 29, entered the Washington, D.C., market gingerly in November, but she and her husband, Lawrence, ended up getting the first house they went for.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our Realtor was saying all these people were talking about how the bubble may be bursting. ... For our house, in a pretty sought- after area, there was only one other bidder, and we only had to pay 1% above what they were asking," says Katherine Race Brin, adding that the sellers got 35% more than they paid for it two years earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the first of the year, the local market has heated up, with prices rising 10% to 15%. A friend of Brin's bid on, but didn't get, a house down the block, which went for $100,000 above the asking price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales and new-home sales both posted large gains in March, with existing-home prices up 11.4% on a year-over-year basis - - the biggest gain since 1980. Interest rates, which briefly rose to about 6% for a 30-year fixed mortgage are back to about 5.75%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR expects existing-home sales to decline about 1.2% this year and new-home sales to slip 2.5%. Prices are expected to rise 7%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most say after years of such predictions, who knows?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In 2004, the market had an adjustment during the last two quarters," says Waldron, the Los Angeles real estate agent. "Then in January, it started all over again. Boom. It's back into multiple offers."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past decade the Internet has changed many things. Consumers today are more likely to book domestic flights online than through a travel agent. And they are as likely to trade stocks with a click of a mouse as with a call to a broker.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New technology has led to lower fees and better informed consumers in many industries. But you won't find many of its benefits in the business of buying and selling homes. You'll generally pay 5% or more to sell, no matter the price of the house, the speed of the sale or the cost of the Realtor's time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents have zealously protected their role as matchmakers by fighting off low-cost Internet brokers trying to revolutionize the business. To keep things that way, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) has proposed a rule allowing members to withhold listings from these upstarts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR is a powerful lobby with influential members in every congressional district. President Bush is to address its convention on Friday. But storm clouds are looming in Washington: After two years of study, the Justice Department is eyeing a lawsuit to block the pending rule, as part of a broader effort to bring competition to the business, helping home buyers and sellers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By allowing agents to selectively withhold listings from whomever they want, the rule would transform the heart of their business -- the pools of listings known as multiple listing services (MLSs) -- into means of thwarting competition. This, in turn, would help preserve a system rigged to maintain high commissions and jobs for Realtors. Consider:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Commissions. The average percentage paid has drifted down in the past decade, from 6.1% to 5.1%. But soaring prices have led to larger dollar amounts, even as houses are selling at a rapid-fire pace. Commissions paid in 2004 averaged $9,500 on existing homes and $11,600 on new homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Jobs. While the Internet has brought reductions in service jobs in other industries, real estate employment is swelling. Since 1999, membership in the NAR has risen from 740,000 to more than 1.2 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many agents argue that they own their listings and they should be allowed to share them, or not, as they see fit. That argument would carry more weight if they weren't already sharing them. No one is suggesting that companies couldn't keep their listings to themselves. The problem comes when they share with companies that agree to their set of rules while withholding them from others.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the principle at issue: A multiple listing service is essentially a common marketplace created by companies and agents that otherwise compete. Antitrust law generally allows this kind of collaboration, but only if the market is open to all. Once certain companies are excluded, the collaborative effort is no longer a market but a joint venture of established players against newcomers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, five major airlines wouldn't have been allowed to create a travel website called Orbitz if the government thought that discount carriers would be excluded.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That type of exclusionary behavior is exactly what many Realtors believe is their right. It's time for someone to stand up to them -- and for the people who are buying and selling homes.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allegations that organized real estate is trying to "squash" low- fee Internet competition couldn't be more misleading. The industry is one of the most competitive (and cooperative) in the United States. And the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the industry's trade association, was established on the premise of increasing ethical behavior.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My company and others like it insist that U.S. franchisees be NAR members. For consumers, the benefit lies in knowing that their agents are NAR members (while a number of low-fee and limited- service providers are not) and are, therefore, held to higher ethical standards. In no way does NAR affect the fees charged to consumers. Each broker is responsible for establishing a fee structure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies within the industry have long had what is known as "menu pricing," or different fees for different levels of service. These are determined not by NAR but by a combination of the brokerage, consumers and market conditions.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low-fee providers typically surface in strong seller's markets. But, because these providers do not rely on customer service, they tend to disappear in weaker markets that require more work to sell properties.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice Department officials will meet today with the National Association of Realtors to discuss the department's antitrust investigation into the association's efforts to bar online brokerages from using the Realtors' home listings, a spokesman for the group says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meeting comes as the possibility of a Justice Department lawsuit against the association looms. At issue: a proposed Realtors' Association rule that would limit access to the multiple listing services that agents use to market and find homes for sale.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice officials worry that the rule would let Realtors choose who can and can't compete at a time when real estate prices are spiraling higher, say three attorneys involved in the discussions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both sides claim to be doing what's best for consumers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The online brokers who are the target of the rule have told Justice officials that the rule doesn't make sense for home buyers or sellers who would presumably want the broadest exposure to their listings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NAR spokesman Steve Cook says, "It's the right of a homeowner and their agent to decide what's the best way to market their house."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR rule is set to take effect in July; the matter is expected to be settled or to be on the way to court before then.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona confirmed that the investigation is looking into the "potential competitive impact of certain rules involving the display of residential real estate listings data over the Internet."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Existing home sales jumped more than expected last month, while the median price soared 11.4% from March 2004 -- the biggest year-over-year leap since 1980, a trade group said Monday in a report that belied predictions of a slowing market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes, town houses, condominiums and co-ops, which account for about 85% of all home sales, rose 1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.89 million in March. That's the third-highest sales figure on record, well above economists' predictions for an essentially flat sales month. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median U.S. existing home price rose to $195,000, in the third-consecutive month of double-digit price gains. The median price for an existing home rose 18.9%, year-over-year, in the West to $289,000; 14.7% in the Northeast to $242,000; 11.2% in the Midwest to $159,000; and 7% in the South to $169,000. Volume rose in all regions except the Northeast. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists for months have been expecting the housing market to slow from 2004's record pace. But in recent weeks, sales have heated up, buoyed by a generally strong economy and mortgage rates that remain below 6% for a 30-year fixed loan. Changing demographics, including higher immigration and the increased economic clout of baby boomers, are also underpinning the market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists warn markets are becoming seriously out of whack in some areas of the country, particularly on the East and West coasts. Federal Reserve Governor Don Kohn in a speech last week called housing prices "lofty," though expecting them to slowly correct rather than crash. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report Monday, the Census Bureau said Hispanic homeownership hit a peak of 49.7% in the first quarter of 2005. Overall homeownership stayed about constant at 69.1%, while African- American homeownership was 48.8%, compared with 49.1% in the fourth quarter of 2004. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors said the supply of homes for sale fell a bit in March, though inventory is higher than at the end of 2004. "We'd really like to see a bigger supply of homes so people don't feel pressured," says Al Mansell, CEO of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Salt Lake City and president of the Realtors group. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, says mortgage application data suggest sales could remain near the March level until interest rates rise significantly and stay high. Prices should continue to rise, "though we doubt the rate of increase can climb any further," Shepherdson said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The trend in sales remains remarkably steady at a very high level, though no further upward movement is likely," Shepherdson said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existing home sales data follow last week's report that new home construction dropped 17.6% in March, though some of the decline could reflect weather. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists will be closely watching today's report on new home sales for further clues as to the health of the market.  </p>

 </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In today's booming housing market, buyers are increasingly willing to fork over $1 million or more for their dream house. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, nearly 51,000 buyers -- 65% in California -- spent $1 million or more for a single-family home, says DataQuick Information Systems. That's a fivefold increase since 1999, when 10,000 homes fetched $1 million-plus. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Derek Walter, 43, is one buyer who views high-end real estate as a good investment. He paid $1.1 million in 2004 for a four-bedroom "second" home with ocean views on Bald Head Island off North Carolina. "There's no other houses between us and the beach," he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big demand for seven-figure homes is adding fuel to the current debate about whether the real estate market is overheating in the USA, or at least in certain ZIP codes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Shiller, a Yale University economist, says a bubble is forming and will end badly: "People have transferred their affections from the stock market to real estate." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But David Lereah, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors (NAR), counters that low interest rates, positive demographics and a strong economy will buoy real estate through the end of the decade. Driving megapricey buys: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Price appreciation. A home valued at $725,000 at the end of 1999 is now worth $1 million, based on the 6.7% median annual appreciation of homes since then. Hot markets have enjoyed double- digit annual price gains. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Low interest rates. Cheap loans make homes more affordable. A buyer borrowing $1 million now at 6% would spend $60,000 in interest in year one -- the same as it cost to finance $600,000 in 1990 when mortgage rates were 10%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Tight supply. "There are still more buyers than sellers," says John Karevoll, a DataQuick analyst. There's now a 4.2-month supply of homes for sale, NAR says. A six-month supply is deemed a fair balance between buyers and sellers. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Favorable tax treatments. After two years, a couple can sell a house and pay no taxes on up to $500,000 in gains. That's making it easier to move up to larger houses. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $1 million-plus market shows no sign of cooling. In Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., 59 homes priced above $1 million are currently under contract, and 171 more are for sale, says Roberta Murphy of Windermere Exclusive Properties. In Tucson, 33 home sales in 2005 broke the $1 million barrier, and another 31 are under contract, says Kandy Walsh at Long Realty. That's on track to beat the 93 $1 million-plus homes sold last year. "At our weekly sales meetings, there are always brokers who say, 'I need something between $1 million and $1.3 million,' " she says. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New home and apartment construction jumped nearly 5% in January to the highest level in nearly 21 years, bolstered by historically low mortgage rates, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts reached 2.16 million units on a seasonally adjusted annual basis in January. That's up from 2.06 million the previous month and is a nearly 12% increase from January 2004. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing permits, an indicator of future activity, rose nearly 2% to a 2.1 million seasonally adjusted annual rate. The housing- starts figure was the highest since February 1984. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The robust figures surprised economists. Many had predicted a dip in activity during January and expect the record-setting housing market -- one of the brightest spots in the economy -- to cool this year, partly in response to Federal Reserve interest rate increases. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is persuasive evidence that the U.S. economy came into 2005 with considerable momentum and that Fed (rate increases) so far (have) had little or no dampening effect on spending," says Roger Kubarych of HVB Group. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank has raised short-term rates six times since late June, from a four-decade low of 1% to the current 2.5%. Additional rate increases are expected. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders predict the market will maintain a healthy pace in 2005, pointing to low inventories and high demand in many areas. Further, long-term bond and mortgage rates have remained muted despite the central bank's moves. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday, said he did not fully understand what was happening in the bond market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the moment, the broadly unanticipated behavior of the world bond market remains a conundrum," Greenspan said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists said the housing-starts report underscored the need for further Fed action. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While we don't believe the housing market is in a so-called bubble, we are concerned that artificially low mortgage rates are causing excess risk-taking in real estate," the investment banking firm Griffin Kubik Stephens &amp; Thompson said in an advisory. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mortgage Bankers Association said the average rate for a 30- year fixed-rate mortgage was 5.5% in the week ended Feb. 11. Still, mortgage activity is down about 13% from last year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the strength in housing construction was in the South, with building starts up 18.8% in January. In the West, starts rose 1.9% during the month. But housing starts declined nearly 24% in the Northeast and 12.5% in the Midwest during the month.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Existing home sales set another record in 2004, though sales slowed in December, while consumer confidence jumped to a six-month high in January, according to Tuesday reports. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales, the bulk of all sales, hit an all-time high of 6.68 million units in 2004. It was the fourth record-setting year in a row and well above the 6.10 million sales logged in 2003. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are signs a long-expected cooling in the housing market may be underway. Existing home sales in December fell 3.3% below November's record pace, while price acceleration slowed. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our sense was that November sales were the peak for the current housing cycle, but activity remains strong," says David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. He expects 2005 to be the second-best year on record. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales fell 7.2% in the West in December from November, and 4.2% in the South, though rising 1.4% in the Midwest and Northeast. Median prices were down in the Northeast, which has seen some of the fastest increases. Overall, the median home price rose more than 8% in 2004 to $184,100, the fastest gain since 1980. But the pace of price rises slowed in December from the previous month. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates, which now average about 5.7% for a 30-year fixed mortgage, are expected to rise in 2005, but still remain under 7%. Some economists, including some at the Federal Reserve, warn that housing is overpriced in a number of cities and could face a correction if the economy falters. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many downplay worries of a national price bubble, the rapid price appreciation is making it tough for some potential buyers. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"First-time buyers, it's always a concern," says Tom Kunz, CEO of real estate company Century 21, saying prices have risen so fast in certain areas, some buyers "may have to buy a little bit less than what they originally intended." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the New York-based Conference Board said its consumer confidence index inched up to 103.4 in January from 102.7 in December. While consumers' perceptions of current conditions improved, their outlook for the coming six months slipped a bit in the survey of 5,000 households. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of consumers calling business conditions good rose to 26% from 24.4%. The share terming jobs plentiful rose slightly. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the percentage expecting business conditions to improve in the next six months inched down to 21.1% from 22.4%. The jobs outlook was basically unchanged, and the share of consumers who expect their incomes to grow dropped to 18% from 21%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Wood of Insight Economics says even with the improvement, confidence seemed fragile. "For there to be a sustained rise in confidence, job creation will have to accelerate," Wood says.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The housing market should slow next year from its recent, blistering pace, but don't expect homes to become more affordable. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists, builders and Realtors generally predict 2005 will be another historically strong sales year, though slightly below the record-setting pace of 2004. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new and existing homes could dip about 5%, according to Douglas Duncan, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. Price increases should moderate to 5% to 6% from their double-digit pace, including an average 13% price rise between the third quarters of 2003 and 2004 alone. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even at the slower rate, prices would rise faster than forecast inflation and wage growth. Interest rates are expected to rise, which could make it tougher for some to get into the market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, forecasts mortgage rates on 30-year, fixed-rate loans will rise to 6.75% from about 5.70% now by the end of 2005. Duncan expects rates to rise to 6.25% </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would not anticipate a decline in house prices or even a lot of slowing," Duncan says. "We don't think (any increase) will be double digit, but it might be 5% to 6% a year." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand to stay strong </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders and Realtors say demand is so strong -- due to tough zoning laws, higher-than-expected immigration, a firming economy and baby boomers' buying power -- that they don't see much moderation ahead. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Interest rates do not drive the home-building industry," says Donald Tomnitz, CEO of home builder D.R. Horton, one of the nation's largest, which reported record sales and earnings, including a 56% rise in net income, in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. He adds that builders have become much more careful not to carry large inventory, helping stabilize the market and prices. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite warnings from some economists that a dangerous home price "bubble" has developed, a number of builders and Realtors don't see rampant price speculation. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York this month did not see evidence of a bubble, pinning higher prices largely on market fundamentals. It did say an economic downturn could hurt pricey areas on the East and West coasts but added that such price declines in the past have not had devastating effects on the overall economy. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Eller, CEO of Centex, one of the nation's top home builders, expects his company to increase deliveries of homes by 15% to 20% next year. The company is also reporting record earnings and demand. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fundamental driver is the economic recovery," says Eller, who expects gains from job creation and economic growth to outweigh any impact from rising mortgage rates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lereah predicts existing-home sales -- the majority of all home sales -- will dip 3% below the expected total of 6.58 million in 2004. Sales of new homes, which tend to be more expensive, should decline about 4.5%. Still, his projections would make 2005 the second-strongest sales year on record. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said last week that new-home sales fell 12% in November from October. Economists said the numbers underscored their predictions for softer sales ahead, but they didn't expect continued sharp monthly drops. Existing-home-sales figures come out Wednesday. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some industry officials are seeing moderation in price increases - - especially in hot areas such as Las Vegas, where average prices have increased 40% in the past year -- but no declines. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Don't expect prices to go down, just a slowdown in prices going up," says Bob Toll, CEO of Toll Bros., the nation's largest luxury- home builder. Toll Bros.' revenue grew 40% in fiscal 2004. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Toll Bros. is doing especially well because of a polarization in our society that is creating so much wealth" among those on the upper end of the income scale, Toll says. He points out that wealth is increasing far faster among families making $100,000 a year or more -- the firm's target market -- than other segments of the population. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with the optimism, and the fact that homeownership has hit records, is rising concern that many households are being priced out of the market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is acute in areas of the East and West coasts with the fastest price appreciation. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The California Association of Realtors says just 19% of state households could afford a median-priced home in October, a 6- percentage-point decline since October 2003. Consumers in the state needed an income of $106,680 to buy a median-priced home of $460,370. Those figures are based on an average 5.7% mortgage rate and assume a 20% down payment. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), as part of a forum on housing affordability this month, released a study showing workers in four occupations -- teachers, police officers, nurses and retail sales workers -- were hard-pressed to find affordable housing in the 25 largest U.S. metro areas. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAHB says such workers had enough income to buy less than half the available housing stock. Retail workers, however, were able to buy in only about 3% of the areas surveyed. Overall, affordable housing tended to be older and either clustered in the center of a city where homes are less attractive or in poor condition or scattered on its fringes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I understand there's an increase in homeownership. But the options of where (it's possible to buy) are being reduced. . . . There are large segments of large cities where affordability is a big problem," says David Crowe, NAHB senior staff vice president. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bobby Rayburn, NAHB president and a home and apartment builder from Jackson, Miss., says that while the study focused on 25 cities, the problem is widespread. He cites government regulation and public opposition to affordable housing as part of the reason for the crunch. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability in comfort range </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lereah points out that even with double-digit appreciation over the past several years, the Realtors' overall housing affordability index is positive, especially compared with other periods when high interest rates and a slow economy crimped buying power. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He expects the affordability measure to erode a bit next year but to remain in the comfort range. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Affordability is very healthy right now, and that raises eyebrows. . . . Interest rates are near a cyclical low," Lereah says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average house prices rose at the fastest pace in a quarter century from September 2003 to September 2004 and have jumped nearly 50% in the past five years, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). Average home price appreciation of 13% from the third quarter of 2003 to 2004 was above the less-than-3% consumer inflation rise in that period. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, real wages have not been keeping pace with inflation. The Labor Department said weekly earnings, adjusted for inflation, fell 1.6% from November 2003 to November 2004. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National averages obscure regional differences, however. While prices rose 30% or more in seven metropolitan areas in California and Nevada in the past year, the OFHEO said other areas such as Montgomery, Ala., and Indianapolis saw price growth of 3% or less.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential and commercial development in the next quarter- century will eclipse anything seen in previous generations as the nation moves to accommodate rapid population growth, according to a Brookings Institution report today. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About half the homes, office buildings, stores and factories that will be needed by 2030 don't exist today, says Arthur C. Nelson, author of the report for the think tank in Washington, D.C. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. population is expected to increase 33% to 376 million by 2030, according to Nelson's analysis. That's 94 million more people than in 2000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To serve that population, almost 60 million housing units will have to be built. About 20 million of these units will replace destroyed or aging homes. In addition, half of the largest metropolitan areas will have to add as much or more commercial and industrial space as existed in 2000, the report says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The projections are startling for a nation already coping with sprawl, traffic congestion and the strains they put on the environment. Phenomenal growth in the South and West has turned deserts and soybean fields into cities. The report projects that these regions, which face water limitations, will experience the greatest surge in construction in the next 25 years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That kind of statistic is either terrifying or a wonderful opportunity," says David Goldberg, spokesman for Smart Growth America, a national coalition of groups that support managing growth. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If development patterns don't change, subdivisions will continue to sprout on farmland farther from metropolitan areas, requiring more roads and sewer lines. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to get this message out to planners so that they see the big numbers," says Nelson, director of urban affairs and planning at the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech. "There may be no better time than now to plan the shape of the landscape." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For generations, Americans favored single-family homes on larger lots. Development spread to where land was cheaper but within commuting distance to jobs. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Communities must decide whether they "want to develop policies consistent with those preferences or constrain them," says John Kasarda, director of the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. "Sprawl is a choice." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs that people want more choices. Frustration with long commutes is mounting. Downtown housing is enjoying a revival. Even suburbs are creating city-styled town centers that combine stores, offices, condos and townhouses in a walk able environment. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But change is coming slowly, says John McIlwain, senior housing fellow at the Urban Land Institute, a research group that works with developers: "We're going to wind up with anywhere between 60% and 70% of development occurring where it's always occurred since World War II: on the outer edge."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Existing-home sales surged 3.1% in September to the third-highest level on record, propelled by low interest rates, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.75 million units, a pace that would have been faster if hurricanes hadn't taken a bite out of activity in the Southeast. "If continued, this would be the fourth-consecutive year existing-home sales have set a new record," says Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin Kubik Stephens &amp; Thompson, a Chicago-based investment banking firm. But he added that the rise in home prices is not being fully captured in consumer inflation data. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase follows a couple of months of declining sales. Home sales were off 0.7% in the South in September, the only part of the country to show softening. Prices declined slightly from August, but were up 8.6% from a year ago. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling mortgage rates helped fuel the September bounce back. Average rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages dropped to 5.75% in September, from a high of 6.29% in May, according to mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the Federal Reserve has raised the target for short- term interest rates to 1.75% from 1% since June, bond traders have pushed longer-term rates down, betting inflation will remain under control. Slow job growth has also dampened rates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Census Bureau data Monday showed the U.S. home ownership rate at 69% in the third quarter of 2004, about even with the 69.2% record of the spring. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said he did not see a dangerous home price "bubble" developing. But Goldman Sachs this month estimated the housing market is 10% overvalued. The national median home price in September was $186,600. Inventories were a tight 4.4 months in relation to current sales. But inventories are large by historical standards and could become a drag if sales slow.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Due for a transfer? You could make a killing if your boss ships you from La Jolla, Calif., where a 2,200-square- foot house averages $1.7 million, to Minot, N.D., where a comparable house is just $130,300. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But moving from Knoxville, Tenn., to Beverly Hills, Calif., won't be such a pleasant a change from a housing price point of view. It costs $1.2 million more, on balance, for the same type home in Beverly Hills. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those are some of the findings of real estate giant Coldwell Banker's annual survey comparing average costs for "middle- management" houses -- defined as approximately 2,200 square feet with four bedrooms, two-and-a-half baths, a family room and two-car garage -- in 348 markets across the USA, Puerto Rico and Canada. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey in many ways reflects U.S. real estate trends, with high-priced homes clustered on the East and West coasts, and less expensive houses in the Midwest and South. Because of the type of homes selected, average prices are heftier than in other surveys. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are middle-management homes, it's going to be higher," says Jim Gillespie, CEO and president of Coldwell Banker Real Estate. But he adds that in more than 60% of the markets, the average price for the survey house is less than $300,000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a lot of money, don't get me wrong, but it's still reasonable for this type property," Gillespie says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cumulative, average sales price of the typical U.S. middle- management house was $354,372 in the areas surveyed, up 11.4% from 2003. The markets closest to average were Minneapolis and Leesburg/ Loudon County, Va. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">La Jolla was the priciest market for the second year in a row, while Minot was the most affordable. Seven of the top 10 most expensive markets were in California, with Montana and Texas each having two of the least pricey. Areas of Oklahoma, Tennessee, Kansas, West Virginia and Michigan were among the 10 most affordable. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Price appreciation in Texas has been modest compared to a lot of other states, even in the Midwest," says Mark Dotzour, chief economist with the Real Estate Center at Texas A&amp;M University. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In Texas, the economy is increasing, but at a very moderate rate. We're having increased demand, but we're also having an enormous increase in supply," Dotzour says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coldwell Banker's Gillespie says prospective buyers and sellers use the data and an index on the firm's Web site, to calculate how much they will pay or save if they move or buy a second investment home. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Federal Reserve starting to raise rates and homeowners sitting atop several years of double-digit appreciation in hot markets, some see this as a good time to think about cashing in. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We see a fair number of people that relocate from the Minnesota Twin Cities. They sell a $300,000 home and come down here and buy a $100,000 home, and they're very happy," says Bruce Walker, owner- broker of Coldwell Banker 1st Minot Realty in North Dakota. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses in Minot are on the market an average 112 days. Pricier homes, $200,000 or more, aren't selling as fast this year, though the area has had steady gains in overall sales and prices. Though a couple of houses have been listed for more than $1 million, they haven't sold for that amount. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For a million dollars you could have two square blocks, for sure," Walker jokes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In La Jolla, Jim Shultz, associate vice president of Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate Services, is having a hard time finding houses that fit the firm's "middle-manager" definition. That's because they're being torn down to make room for grander, 4,000-5,000-square-foot structures. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those houses are disappearing , and it's not slowly, it's quickly," Shultz says. "We're losing a couple of hundred houses a year. . . . La Jolla is no longer what I would call a middle- manager community." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">La Jolla has cooled from white hot to red hot, with houses remaining on the market for about two months, as compared with two weeks earlier this year. Properties are selling for about 5% below list price, as opposed to earlier this year when there were multiple offers for above asking. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market cooling a bit </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, recent data show existing home sales slowing from the torrid pace of the spring, when buyers jumped into the market, fearing Fed policy would quickly boost mortgage rates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said last week existing home sales declined in August to the slowest pace in five months, with price growth decelerating to a still-strong 7% year-over-year pace. New home sales jumped last month, however, after an earlier slowdown. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect steady, if slower sales growth ahead, or even another near-term uptick in sales. That's because interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, after rising this spring when the Fed signaled it would raise rates, have since dropped back below 6%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders, says the housing industry is getting a second wind, thanks to the fact that mortgage rates have stayed unexpectedly low while the economy has expanded. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some indications that existing home prices are starting to moderate in pricier areas, partly because more sellers are entering the market, hoping to take advantage of recent price gains. Over the longer run, some Federal Reserve officials say prices could fall in over-inflated areas if the economy stumbles. But they don't see a national "bubble" about to burst. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coldwell Banker found big price variations not just in different parts of the country, but within states. Moving from Bozeman, Mont., where the average middle-manger house is $256,499, to Great Falls, Mont., where prices run $130,525, could be a good deal. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alabama has the least price variation, with a less than $8,000 difference between Huntsville and Mobile. California, has the largest -- from the $1,708,333 average in La Jolla to the $348,600 price in Riverside/Ontario. In Canada, the priciest market was Vancouver, British Columbia, with an average sales price of $491,058. The most affordable was Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, at $104,958. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New home sales rebounded in August, posting their biggest one-month gain since late 2000 as low mortgage rates lured buyers into the market, the government said Monday. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said sales jumped 9.4% in August from July, hitting a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.184 million homes. That's up from the 1.082 million pace of July -- a number that was revised down from an initial, more robust estimate. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In dollar amounts, we're up 57% year-over-year. Our business continues to be pretty robust," says J. Larry Sorsby, CFO of Hovnanian Enterprises, a New-Jersey based firm that builds along much of the East Coast, and in California, Texas and other states. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has proved to be far more resilient than many economists had expected. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some predicted September could be another strong month, even with expected volatility in the hurricane-ravaged Southeast, because interest rates on 30-year mortgages are running below 6%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing demand should hold up quite well," says Steve Stanley of Greenwich Capital Markets. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We look for employment and income growth to pick up in the coming months, providing additional support, and the demographics are favorable over a longer time horizon," he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home sales in the past several months have settled down from the breakneck pace of spring. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry holds a 4.2-month inventory of unbuilt homes, not too out of line with the long-term average. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Steven Wood of Insight Economics points out that the number of available new homes, at 404,000, has risen 17.4% in the past year to the highest level since 1979. He calls it the most rapid rise in a decade. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, says he expected the Federal Reserve campaign to raise short-term interest rates to push mortgage rates higher. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While mortgage rates rose in the spring, they have fallen as the bond markets have decided that inflation is not a looming problem. Some economists call low rates with steady growth the perfect recipe for home sales. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders also have not been derailed by higher costs for everything from concrete to plywood. While new home prices dipped in August, the average price of $267,000 is up about 10% from a year ago. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices are still moving up pretty darn smartly. In that environment, cost increases basically get swallowed," Seiders said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said that sales were up 6.1% in the Northeast in August, 12.6% in the South and 19.5% in the West. Sales were down 8.3% in the Midwest, compared with July. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in all regions but the West were below year-ago levels.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring housing costs mean more workers are unable to afford homes in the areas where they work, a problem that has major repercussions for employers trying to recruit and retain workers in hot housing markets. So more employers are offering housing benefits such as grants and loans -- in some cases, even building homes their employees can afford. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Megan Banach, a housing benefit offered by her employer meant she could stop living with her parents and get a place of her own. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About three months ago, the registered nurse bought a two- bedroom condo a block from her employer, Northwest Community Hospital in Arlington Heights, Ill. She bought it through a program the hospital runs. It allows full-time employees who earn less than $70,000 a year to get $5,000 toward a down payment on a first home. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees must stay at the hospital five years or they have to repay all or part of the money. Homes must be within 10 miles of work. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's nice to know they're helping me out," says Banach, 23. "I can walk to work when I'm on call." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The perk is catching on as low interest rates push housing prices to new highs. In 2003, prices of existing homes appreciated at a rate of 7.5%, the largest increase in more than a decade, according to the National Association of Realtors. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means workers are putting up with longer commutes, quitting jobs to work closer to communities they can afford and refusing to relocate to cities where homeownership may be out of reach. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some occupations that are especially hard hit: teachers, police officers, firefighters, janitors, retail salespeople and nurses. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Teachers live with parents, roommates," says Jason Blum, 38, an elementary school teacher in San Francisco who has been trying to buy a home. "At my school, the longest commute is an hour away." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entire communities feel the pinch. The dearth of affordable housing inhibits economic growth, because access to labor is a top factor in business development. Areas also suffer when employees vital to a community, such as firefighters, police and teachers, can't afford to live there. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The term 'affordable housing' had traditionally been associated with low-income housing," says Cassandra Matthews, an associate legislative director for the National Association of Counties, which represents county governments. "But we're seeing that it's a middle- class problem." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers help on housing </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some employers have responded by relaxing rules that require workers to live close by. In Lake Forest, Ill., for example, police once had to live within 10 miles of work. As housing costs climbed, that requirement changed: Today, it's 25 miles. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other employers spend cash to offer a mix of housing benefits, a growing perk even amid the tepid job market and cost-cutting business climate. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty percent of employers helped workers with mortgages or down payments in 2004, up from 9% in 2000. And 19% offered rental assistance, up from 5% in 2002, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down-payment assistance can vary widely, with employers providing $1,000 to more than $10,000 per employee. Experts say mortgage assistance can include credit counseling, help finding real estate agents, financial help and partnerships with non-profits that help employees navigate the home-buying process. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A host of companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems, Intel and Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., are getting involved. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before 2000, Fannie Mae provided 10 to 15 employers a year of free guidance to set up housing assistance. In 2000, they set a goal to help 1,000 employers in 10 years. From 2000 to today, the mortgage investor has assisted almost 500. The number of employers helped in 2004 has outpaced any other year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'A bottom-line issue' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though such benefits aren't cheap for employers, the cost of turnover without such a program can be more painful. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Once upon a time, health care and child care weren't an employer issue, either," says Robin Snyderman of the Metropolitan Planning Council in Illinois, which has helped lead a homeownership program with local employers. "This is a bottom-line issue, and that's what's attracting employers to the table." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some employers are buying homes and renovating them for workers or creating their own housing, a throwback to turn-of-the-century company towns. For example: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* In San Diego, a school board proposal would develop affordable housing for teachers and other residents. (One idea involves converting land that houses a defunct elementary school into apartments.) The proposal could become reality: A non-profit foundation has been set up to study the concept. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Diego, the median home price in 2003 was $407,000, according to the Center for Housing Policy, the research affiliate of the National Housing Conference. The median annual salary needed to qualify for a mortgage that size was $126,851; the median salary for an elementary teacher in the city was $48,840. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* In Cincinnati, Jancoa Janitorial Services launched an independent organization to help employees reach dreams such as homeownership. They've purchased a home for $34,000 and are renovating it before reselling it to a worker. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional help comes in the form of guidance and pre-purchase counseling. A program walks employees through the process. An adviser works with buyers through closing day, even sitting beside them as final papers are signed. Employees celebrate with cake and balloons at work. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soraya Ardon, 27, of Cincinnati bought a home two years ago through the program. The mother of two is human resources manager for Jancoa; the guidance was key, she says, to understanding the process and moving out of her mother's house to her own. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The happiest moment of my life was the closing," Ardon says. "They take you through the whole process. I wouldn't have any idea what to do otherwise." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cincinnati, the median home price in 2003 was $140,000. The annual income needed to qualify for that size mortgage is $43,634; the median salary of janitors in Cincinnati was $20,020, according to the Center for Housing Policy. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Mayo Clinic pledged $4 million in 1998 for housing and an additional $1 million a year in grants to match money raised by the community. The partnership has paid off, with plans to build 600 single-family units and 275 multifamily units. About 533 units have been built. Housing is open to all residents in and around Rochester who qualify, based on income and credit rating; a third of the region's workforce is employed by Mayo. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can't treat patients if we don't have employees come in to work here," says Karel Weigel, administrator for community relations at Mayo. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Rochester's county, the median home price was $134,900 for 2001-02, according to HousingMinnesota, an organization focused on affordable housing in the state. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other employers are doling out forgivable loans, grants, credit counseling and other services. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies provide housing benefits for their workers only, while others provide funding that helps the community. Some companies are joining with other businesses to alleviate the housing crunch. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avoiding the real issue? </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some say the programs help only a few or miss the real issue. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to put more money into salaries," says Barbara Kerr, president of the California Teachers Association. "It's a serious problem." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New research shows that the housing crunch is escalating. Income growth lags dramatically behind housing costs nationwide, while elementary teachers, police officers, licensed practical nurses, retail salespeople and janitors in Southern metropolitan areas have been particularly affected, according to a study by the Center for Housing Policy. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing problem is very, very disturbing," says Bob Reid, president of the center in Washington, D.C. "The cost of homes is going up faster than incomes. This affects millions of people who can't afford to live where they work, and we don't see the problem getting any better." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why some employees say programs are critical to homeownership. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly three years ago, insurance provider Aflac partnered with a non-profit to help employees buy homes. The Columbus Housing Initiative, a non-profit housing development organization in Georgia, provides pre-purchase counseling. Aflac donated to CHI for the program; employees who participate get up to $5,000 toward a down payment. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dawn Brown, 40, bought a house through the program more than a year ago. The program taught her to save, budget and understand financing, and she got $1,000 toward a down payment. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I told my daughter, when we get a house, she can pick the color. She painted it pink with purple trim," says Brown, a claims adjuster at Aflac. Her daughter, Tori, is 10. "It's amazing that a company would do this." </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans' passion for living large is growing, even if their incomes aren't, a Census survey released Thursday indicates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the beginning of the decade, their homes have gotten substantially bigger and more expensive. Almost half of all homes, about 46%, have six or more rooms. More than 15% have eight rooms or more. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost one in five families have three or more cars. And more workers are opting out of carpools and mass transit to drive to work alone. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this lifestyle comes at a cost when incomes are stagnating and housing prices are soaring. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report on poverty and income, the Census Bureau reported that median household income, when adjusted for inflation, remained flat last year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the survey of how Americans live finds that more than 22% of homeowners spent at least 35% of their income on housing in 2003, up from 19% in 2000. And 38% of renters spent as much, up from 33% in 2000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our wages stopped growing, but our wants kept going," says Robert Lang, a demographer who heads the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People will just suffer a little and pay a bigger mortgage to hold on to their dreams," he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest snapshot of American life comes from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. The annual survey of 800,000 households asks the same questions as the Census that is taken every 10 years. The 2003 numbers offer a look at how the nation has changed in the wake of recession and terrorist attacks, and they hint at social trends shaping the decade. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even though the economy took a dive, the initial shock of 9/11 has worn off," says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "People are buying bigger homes, more cars." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riding record-low interest rates, housing prices have skyrocketed. The percentage of homeowners who live in houses valued at more than $500,000 doubled since 2000, to more than 6%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And one in eight homeowners live in homes valued at $300,000 to $499,999. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About half live in homes that cost less than $150,000, the typical price range for working-class families and young couples buying their first homes. But that number has dropped sharply from almost 64% in 2000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in North Dakota, which has the lowest housing value in the nation, prices rose. The median value of a house there went up 10% to $81,796 since 2000. Nationally, the median value rose 22% to $147,275. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey reflects other changes: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The percentage of homes without telephone service rose to 3.8%, from 3% in 2000, which reflects the increased dependence on cellular phones. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of dorms have no phone service now," Lang says. "Kids go to college, and not one of them has a real phone. They're all cells." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The educational level is on the rise. More than a quarter of the population has a bachelor's degree or higher. And the percentage of high school graduates continues to climb, up 2 percentage points to 83.6%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratio of college grads to high school dropouts has increased. There are 1.62 college grads for every dropout, up from 1.35 in 2000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This "brains-to-brawn" ratio reflects the shift from a blue- collar to a knowledge economy, Frey says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Americans are spending about the same 24 minutes commuting to work, but almost 78% are driving alone, up from 76.3% in 2000. The exception is so-called "exurban" counties across the USA, such as Pasco County, north of Tampa, and McHenry and Kane counties outside Chicago. They experienced significant increases in commuting times. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Use of other forms of transportation, from walking to riding a bus, dropped. But the percentage of people working from home increased slightly. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* All racial groups are growing, except for whites who are not Hispanic. Whites make up 76.1% of the population, down from 77.3% in 2000. They're expected to make up half of the population within 50 years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The foreign-born population continues to grow but so does the share of immigrants becoming citizens: 41.4%, up almost 1 percentage point since 2000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because naturalized citizens can vote, there has been a push to encourage naturalization before the upcoming presidential election. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Veterans, who have taken center stage in the race for the White House, make up a relatively large share of several battleground states such as Maine, New Mexico, Florida, Nevada and Arizona. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Although still in the minority at 48.9%, men make up a growing share of the population. Frey attributes the change to male- dominated immigration flows from Latin America.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you think home prices in your area are high, be glad you're not house-hunting in Orange County, Calif. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter, the median price for an existing home in Orange County was $655,300, up nearly 39% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. For the first time, median home prices in Orange County surpassed those in the San Francisco Bay Area, which had been the USA's highest-priced housing market since the late 1990s. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for homes in the San Francisco Bay Area was $647,300, up 15.5% from a year earlier. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the median home price was $183,800 in the second quarter, up 9.1% from a year earlier, according to the NAR. The association's survey of 128 metropolitan regions found a record 49 metro areas with double-digit annual increases. Tight housing supplies created a sellers' market in many parts of the country, the NAR said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orange County has a limited supply of land for new construction, which has driven up prices on existing homes, says Leslie Appleton- Young, chief economist for the California Association of Realtors. In addition, Southern California's economy is growing faster than Northern California's, she says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A limited supply of homes also helped the median home price in Las Vegas jump 52.4% to $269,900, the fastest growth in the nation. Las Vegas had a 1.7-month supply of homes on the market, vs. an average 4.2-month supply for the nation. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers could find some relief soon. The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that new home sales fell a sharper-than-expected 6.4% in July from June. And on Tuesday, the NAR reported that existing home sales fell 2.9% in July. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already in California, houses are staying on the market longer, causing inventories to rise, says Appleton-Young. But while prices will likely moderate, economic growth will prevent a sharp decline, she says.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The frenzied housing market could be cooling. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Wednesday that new home sales fell a sharper-than-expected 6.4% in July from June. That follows the National Association of Realtors' Tuesday report that existing home sales slid 2.9% in July. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The house party is over," Wachovia economist Jason Schenker said in an advisory to clients, noting June and May figures were also revised lower. New home sales are off 11.6% from May -- the worst performance in five years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some economists noted that the market has been volatile as the Federal Reserve has started to raise interest rates. Consumers may have jumped into the housing market this spring trying to beat anticipated higher mortgage rates, then backed out when the economy cooled and 30-year fixed rate mortgages fell back below 6%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had a bunch of people fall off the fence earlier this year, and now people are lined up again on the fence," said Mark Dotzour, chief economist at the Real Estate Center, at Texas A&amp;M University. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists expect a cooling in sales, though they expect 2004 will follow 2003 as a record year. They also expect moderation in prices, which have risen more than 20% a year in some areas, leading to fear of a housing price bubble. The Mortgage Bankers Association mortgage index fell 6% in the week ended Friday. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales in July declined to about 1.134 million units at an annual pace. Monthly sales were off about 24% in the Northeast, 16% in the South and 2% in the West. Sales rose 22% in the Midwest. The median price dipped 1.4% in July. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Toll, CEO of Toll Bros., a luxury home builder, said the drop in sales probably reflected the difficulty of acquiring land. "There is such a strong market in the Northeast, the only reason demand is down is that supply is down," he said. Wednesday, Toll reported third-quarter earnings up 56%.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Feng shui consultants are helping home builders connect with Asian clients. Home Depot has increased its Hispanic advertising budget. Real estate agents from Pennsylvania to rural Texas are enrolling in classes on cross-cultural marketing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're all reaching out to the more than 30 million immigrants in the USA who are an increasingly important factor in the housing market by revitalizing inner cities, changing the texture of suburbs and propelling subtle changes in home design. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher-than-expected immigration, both legal and illegal, is a major reason some economists expect the housing market to stay strong as mortgage rates rise from their lowest level in decades and the baby boomers begin retiring, putting homes on the market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign-born households bought nearly 8% of new homes and 11% of existing homes from 1998 to 2001. Immigrants were 12% of first-time home buyers in 2001 and buy more expensive homes on average than U.S.-born first-time owners, says the Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While immigrants are concentrated in about a dozen large cities, including New York, Miami and Los Angeles, they are spreading out. Thirteen states had more than a 100% rise in their foreign-born population in the 1990s. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's security for my daughter, the security of owning the roof over your head," says Mislanys Rodriguez, 34, of Spring Hill, Fla. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the help of Spanish-speaking mortgage brokers and real estate agents, Rodriguez and her husband, Angel, who came to the USA from Cuba in the mid-1990s, recently sold their starter house and moved to a larger home. Three of Angel's brothers own houses in the USA, as well. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While immigrants are a growing presence, they lag behind the U.S.- born population by large margins when it comes to homeownership. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About half of immigrants own homes, compared with 70% of those born in the USA, a gap that closes as immigrants become U.S. citizens. The difference is also reflected in minority and white realty rates. About 47% of Hispanic and 49.7% of African-American households own their homes, compared with about 76% of whites. About 58% of Asian, Native American and Pacific Islander households are owners, says the National Association of Realtors. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I'm paying rent, I don't get any equity, I don't have a tax deduction, and the rent in San Francisco is just so high," said Giri Sastromihardjo, 34, an accountant who came from Indonesia in 1993. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He worked with Asian Inc., a San Francisco non-profit, and used government and private programs this summer when buying his first home outside San Francisco. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A growing market </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate America sees huge potential in the immigrant market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former federal Housing and Urban Development secretary Henry Cisneros is now chairman and CEO of American CityVista, a joint venture with national builder KB Home, which constructs urban "villages" in big cities like Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have yet to build a community that doesn't sell as fast as it can," says Cisneros, adding that one development in California was sold out at its groundbreaking. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we have a gap in the homeownership rate, that's more than just a gap in the honor of buying a house. That's a gap in the access to wealth," Cisneros says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents around the country report strong demand from foreign-born clients who see homeownership as the American dream. Immigrants are three times as likely as other adults to rank home buying as their top priority, says Andrew Schoenholtz, deputy director of the Georgetown University Institute for the Study of International Migration. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They've struggled long enough. They have decent jobs. They want to leave a legacy for their kids," says Roberto Laureano, a real estate agent in Silver Spring, Md. "Go to settlement with a Hispanic family. You're not going to see just father and mom. You're going to see father and mom and the kids. They'll bring a camera. It means a lot." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The affordability barrier </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as prices rise, affordability is becoming a bigger barrier. Inability to speak English is a constant hurdle. Many foreign-born residents don't have credit histories. Discrimination is a factor. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immigrants, on average, earn less but are clustered in some of the highest-priced housing markets in the country. Asians, however, have higher incomes on average than other ethnic groups. Another hurdle: An estimated 8 million to 10 million foreign-born people are in the USA illegally, lacking documents to get a mortgage. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are not easy loans by any means . . . you need to have a really good heart, a social service attitude toward your buyers," says Yamila Ayad, president of Mission Home Loans in San Marcos, Calif. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some immigrants use backdoor methods to edge into the market, breaking the law and making them targets for exploitation. The Utah attorney general's office is investigating a scam involving up to 100 homes, many bought by illegal immigrants using stolen Social Security numbers. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent Census Bureau data show that Asian and Hispanic populations in the USA grew nearly four times as fast as the overall population from 2000 to 2003. There were about 39.9 million Hispanics in the USA in July 2003, nearly 14% of the population. Asians were the next-fastest-growing segment, at about 4.6% of the population. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Any demographer in the state of Texas would tell you that in just a few short years . . . whites, or Anglos, will be a minority. That's coming to a neighborhood near you," says Gary Maler, associate director of the Real Estate Center at Texas A&amp;M University. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new households, key to housing demand, could be about 10% higher in the next decade than predicted, largely due to immigration, says the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's had a very dramatic impact," says Eric Belsky, director of the Harvard Center. Housing experts had warned that the baby bust, a smaller generation after the baby boom population surge, would suppress household growth and demand for starter homes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That didn't really transpire," Belsky says. "While that baby bust (population) is still smaller than the baby boom, it's a lot less smaller than it would have been." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts point out that immigrant homeownership rates declined in the 1990s, probably due to the sheer size of immigration during the decade, the highest since the late 1800s. But homeownership rates typically rise after immigrants have been in the country a period of years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We will see an increase in homeownership rates for immigrants over time. . . . In a decade, I think we may see that it's a significant increase," Schoenholtz says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closing the housing gap </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the non-profit Center for Housing Policy points out that 14% of immigrant families pay half their incomes for housing, vs. about 8% of U.S.-born families. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politicians, sales agents, bankers and non-profit groups are trying to help close the housing gap, with everything from financial training to down-payment assistance. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, working with housing giant Fannie Mae and others, has created a housing program targeting congressional districts with large Hispanic concentrations. The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and GMAC Mortgage plan to provide more than $400 million in loans to Hispanic communities in the next four years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some banks are experimenting with loans using a federal tax identification number in lieu of a Social Security number. That could help immigrants who don't have legal documentation. The subprime market, loans to higher credit risks, is an important factor. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asha Abokor, 36, from Somalia, recently bought a house in Phoenix. She used her own money and a rebate from KB Home for a down payment. Because she does not have a credit history, she is paying an above-market interest rate. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I wanted it as an investment, to belong to a community with established roots. All those things were really important," Abokor says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals and other groups have stepped up cross-cultural marketing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas A&amp;M's Maler surveyed more than 4,000 Texas residents about housing preferences. He found Asians were willing to spend more for a house than other groups. Blacks were more apt to visit neighborhoods before buying. Hispanics had the least experience with home buying, were likely to seek family advice and wanted a sales agent who speaks Spanish. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Omar Garcia started Aventa Real Estate Services in Tampa last year, offering real estate, title insurance and mortgage service. He now has nearly 50 employees. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Why would I open up a real estate company (now)? Rates are at an all-time low, going to go up. Impacts of technology are starting to affect the general real estate market, margins are getting thinner," says Garcia, whose firm helped the Rodriguez family. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he says there are unmet needs in the Hispanic market, particularly in financing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Depot is accelerating its efforts to reach the multicultural market. The home-improvement chain hired a new ad agency and significantly increased its Hispanic marketing budget. It sponsors the Mexican national soccer team, supports the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and other groups. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saul Gitlin, executive vice president for strategic marketing at Kang &amp; Lee, a New York-based multicultural advertising firm, says participants at the National Hardware Show -- firms selling products for the home -- were intrigued this spring when he laid out statistics about market clout of Asians in the USA. Though less than 5% of the population, Asians have the highest median home value in 48 states. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The financial services industry . . . are all over the Asian- American market like a bee on a flower," Gitlin says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Asian Real Estate Association of America cautions that many Asian immigrants need home-buying help. The group is conducting a study of income and education trends and needs within the Asian community. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A house means the future of our family," Ayad says. "It's one of the greatest joys."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quest for affordable housing is fueling the explosive growth of suburban cities in the Sun Belt and even reviving some old industrial cities in the Northeast, according to population estimates out today. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Census numbers for 2003 show that cities grow when jobs are plentiful and housing costs are relatively low compared with the rest of their regions. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the scramble for value," says Robert Lang, urban expert at Virginia Tech and author of Boomburbs, an upcoming book on large, fast-growing suburbs. "People are finding back doors into the hot places." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hottest places are still concentrated in the Sun Belt. Since 2000, eight of the 10 fastest-growing cities with more than 100,000 people are suburbs of Phoenix, Los Angeles and Las Vegas: Gilbert, Chandler and Peoria, Ariz.; Rancho Cucamonga, Fontana and Irvine, Calif.; and Henderson and North Las Vegas, Nev. The other two are Port St. Lucie and Cape Coral, Fla. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hunt for affordable housing also has helped reverse declines in older cities within commuting range of strong job centers. Cities in New Jersey and Connecticut are enjoying some of the spillover from New York's prosperity. Immigrants who are first-time homebuyers often gravitate toward older areas that offer comparatively cheap housing and good transportation to major job markets. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same trend is unfolding in California, where most growth is away from cities along the coast where housing is expensive. Growth is sweeping inland cities such as Palmdale, Fresno and Bakersfield, where median home prices range from $200,000 to $260,000, compared with $423,000 in Los Angeles and $635,000 in the San Francisco Bay Area. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing affordability is having an incredible effect," says Peter Morrison, demographer at the RAND Corp. "It's driving growth outward." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers also show that: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Some of the nation's older big cities are losing population after gaining in the 1990s. Chicago, which gained more than 100,000 people in that decade, is now losing. So is Boston. But many of their suburbs are growing as families in search of good schools and cheaper and bigger homes move out. New York, while still growing, has slowed considerably. Cities whose losses slowed in the '90s now are losing at a faster pace, including Detroit, Philadelphia and St. Louis. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* San Antonio has replaced Dallas as the nation's eighth-largest city. "Big D" is landlocked; San Antonio keeps annexing land. "Our focus has not been, 'Let's pass Dallas,' but, 'Let's increase the quality of growth in our city,' " says San Antonio Mayor Ed Garza.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- For nearly 500,000 new entrepreneurs, there's no place like home -- especially when it has a "for sale" sign out front. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fueled by the sizzling real estate market, more entrepreneurs started real estate sales and rental firms from 1997 to 2002 than started ventures in any other industry, new Census data show. The 483,339 ventures are among the smallest start-ups. They have no paid employees and often are part-time ventures. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across all industries, the number of non-employer firms soared 14.3% from 1997 to 2002 to a record 17.6 million. That growth is crucial to economic recovery. As many take root and prosper, young start-ups create most innovations and as much as 80% of new jobs. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many new entrepreneurs are jumping into the real estate industry at a dicey time. Rising interest rates threaten the supply of cheap mortgages fueling home sales and higher prices. In a sign of a possible slowdown, average home prices rose 7.7% in the first quarter from a year ago. That was down from 8.1% growth in the fourth quarter, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said last week. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luis Nanez, 40, is undeterred. He became a self-employed Century 21 agent four years ago in Petaluma, north of San Francisco. The Peruvian immigrant is betting on a niche he's carved -- Spanish- speaking buyers and sellers. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nanez is getting referrals from his first customers and plans to build on that base even if sales slump. "It was a good run so far," he says of his first years in business. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other factors driving the trend: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Women. The number of women-led businesses is growing faster than all companies. That's reflected in industry leadership and real estate brokerage ownership. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 52% of brokers are now women, up from 44% in 1993. Ann Pettijohn, a broker in Orange, Calif., remembers when the industry was virtually all male. She's been in real estate since 1972. Now, more women with child-rearing duties seek self-employment because it gives them more flexibility. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You don't have to be somewhere from 9 to 5," says Pettijohn, president of the 135,000-member California Association of Realtors. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Technology. Cheaper computers and other technology cut start- up costs so entrepreneurs can easily build Web sites with digital photos of homes for sale. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, contrary to predictions, Web sites that cut out the middleman haven't caused the same havoc in real estate that they've caused for travel agencies, says the National Association of Realtors. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ventures like ForSaleByOwner.com are gaining ground. That site matches sellers and buyers, saving the 5% to 6% commissions typically charged by traditional real estate agents. The site lists 32,000 homes a month, up from as few as 2,000 a month three years ago.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Merrill Warschoff just paid far too much for a condo that's much too small. It was her only way to break into Washington's sizzling housing market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even a quarter-of-a-million-dollar, tiny, one-bedroom box is turning into a bidding war. It's ridiculous," says Warschoff, 34. The health care consultant is paying $275,000 for a 700-square-foot condominium -- and counting herself lucky after losing a previous bidding battle and seeing prices and mortgage interest rates climb. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has gotten crazier in recent weeks as buyers such as Warschoff try to beat rising rates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales jumped 2.5% in April to the second-highest on record. New home sales dropped nearly 12% in April from a record in March, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Overall, however, new home sales are 18% above last year, and prices rose. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists and agents call the surge a last hurrah as buyers, and sellers, rush into the market, convinced that 30-year mortgage rates, which jumped from under 5.5% in March to about 6.3% this month, will keep rising. Most predict a slowdown in prices and sales, but expect it to be gradual -- as long as interest rates don't suddenly spike -- given strong demand and tight supplies in hot markets. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are worries that prices have risen so high in select areas, particularly the East and West coasts, that "bubbles" could pop if the economy falters, or at least that prices could slow more sharply than expected. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're talking nosebleed heights here," says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors, calling the level of existing home sales "incomprehensible," with April 15% above last year's record. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers are feeling the pinch: Mortgage originations are declining and buyers are turning to adjustable-rate financing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Napoli, senior managing director at Wilshire Associates, points out that more than half of new mortgages in Los Angeles the past month have adjustable-rate features. When interest rates rise, many homeowners could find themselves with massive monthly payments they can't afford. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the market might be able to handle the gradual rise in rates that is widely expected, a big jump could be devastating. "If interest rates were to spike up and stay there, we're in trouble," Napoli says. "Look out." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington-area prices were up 19% in the first quarter vs. first- quarter 2003, hitting a median of about $300,000. In white-hot Southern California, the median price hit $386,000 in April, 26% above April 2003, according to research firm DataQuick Information Systems. In Orange County alone, the median is $523,000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas, Reno, Miami and Sarasota, Fla., had price gains of 20% to 31% in the first quarter of 2004 from a year earlier, and New York and New England are strong -- though much of the country has more normal appreciation. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer anxiety rising </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Thornberg, senior economist at the University of California, Los Angeles, Anderson Forecast, predicts a correction of at least 15% to 20%, given where prices should be based on economic fundamentals. While that would be a nasty drop, it's well below the 45% inflation-adjusted erosion Southern California housing suffered from 1989 to 1997. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others say hot areas should gradually slow, but not fall, as long as the economy is good. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Karevoll, analyst at DataQuick, wouldn't be surprised to see Southern California prices rise another 25% by autumn. He thinks the supply of houses on the market will increase then as homeowners, eager to "sell at what they perceive to be at or near the peak," list their houses for sale. "We knew (prices) would be strong, but we didn't know it would be (this) strong," Karevoll says. He says the market is fueled by former "fence sitters" grabbing low rates, population growth and immigrants. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs that inventories are starting to rise in California and other markets. That has yet to translate into big price slowdowns, leaving consumers anxious. Some fear paying too much by buying at the top, while others' biggest worry is hesitating too long -- missing low rates and facing higher prices </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Barnard, COO of a telecommunications firm, has been waiting in vain for the market to cool since 2001, when he moved to Menlo Park, Calif. Though he and his wife, a marketer, both have incomes, they can't compete in an area where 1,800-square-foot homes are about a million dollars. They've been renting a house. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I wish no bad luck on my neighbors, but I hope that the rates go up to such an extent that they push prices down," Barnard says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding frenzies in top markets </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others who have plunged into the market are resorting to desperation tactics to win a house: writing personal letters to sellers, offering complimentary musical performances and other services and waiving home inspections or other contract contingencies. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The person who bought my house wrote a letter saying how they envisioned having their children riding their bikes in the neighborhood . . . cooking nice dinners in our nice kitchen," says Caterina Tassone, who sold her Washington-area home in April. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tassone, a physicist, lost out in several bidding battles before landing a house last week for well above the asking price. She didn't write a letter, but made an implicit plea for sympathy -- attending an open house with her four children, mother and mother- in law. "The real estate agent felt sorry for me," Tassone says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though government figures show a drop in new homes sales in April, in Peoria, Ill., Blume Construction has a backlog of homes on order and says business has been hot since last fall. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've never seen it this busy," says Nancy Royce, partner and CFO at Blume, which has been in business since the 1930s. The company, which builds houses in the $200,000-$450,000 range, has customers who have been waiting since last fall to start a house. Those ordering now won't have their project started until August or September. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors says 80 cities reported above-normal price appreciation in the first quarter of 2004, with 35 showing double-digit price increases. Overall, the median price for existing homes (at $170,800) was up 6.5% in the first three months of 2004, compared with 2003. Prices rose 18.7% in the Northeast, 10.7% in the West, 1.9% in the Midwest and 3.8% in the South. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, D.C., proper, the number of houses selling for $1 million or more rose 84% in April 2004 compared with April 2003, to 92, according to the Greater Capital Area Association of Realtors. The number of new listings for $150,000 or less fell 57% during the same period. The median price in the city is $335,000, up from $175,600 in 2000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All my listings have sold within a couple of days. Two of my listings . . . for $699,000 . . . were bid up to over $800,000. One had over 15 offers," says Tom Williams, an agent with Long &amp; Foster in Washington, D.C. Melinda Estridge, another Washington- area agent, says homes are moving in days, and worries that out-of- town buyers, especially, are frustrated. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, Bob Waldron, an agent for Coldwell Banker, specializes in an area of Los Angeles near the airport where homes with three bedrooms and two baths average about $700,000. Buyers have become so frantic to get into the area, a few miles from the ocean, that 10 or so offers on a home are common. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To have a chance at a $650,000 home, buyers must top the asking price by roughly $50,000, Waldron says. Those who aren't comfortable at first lose bidding wars. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"How do the buyers react? They say, 'We lost this one, we don't want to lose again.' " So they go over asking prices by $50,000. " 'Let's blow people away and get this,' " clients tell Waldron. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some calmer markets </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are pockets of calm. The National Association of Realtors says 16 metropolitan areas had price declines in the first quarter of 2004. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Dove, an agent in Springfield, Ill., sees no signs of a bubble. Well-priced houses sell quickly, he says, and some have multiple bids. But costlier homes linger. The median price in the area is off 10% from last year, partly because fewer expensive homes have sold. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some of the homes that are $400,000-plus, it's not uncommon to stay on (the market) for a year . . . if they're over $600,000, they can stay on for two years," Dove says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices started moving up in the early 1990s and accelerated in the latter part of the decade. Analysts have been expecting a cool-down for years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, says prices in about 40 states have "pretty neatly" correlated with rising incomes. In some areas, the market is ahead of salaries. "Given that you're not going to have falling interest rates, clearly there has to be a reconciliation of income and price, but that's a long way from saying prices are going to reverse," he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has not been a national price decline since the Great Depression. The biggest threat to prices would be if the economy falters and laid-off workers were forced to sell. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has said markets in Northeast and Pacific states are vulnerable if local economies weaken. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage Bankers Association data show no spike in mortgage delinquencies. DataQuick doesn't see signs of market distress in Southern California, calling foreclosure rates low. The typical monthly payment for Southern California buyers in April was $1,755, up from $1,606 in March. But payments, as measured in today's dollars, were higher in 1989, at $2,077. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bargain rates and government programs have provided a rung up for lower-income buyers to get into the market. But as rates and prices rise, apartments are turned into condos and modest houses bulldozed for tract mansions, buyers of moderate means are being priced out of more markets. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocacy groups such as the National Low Income Housing Coalition say families are falling behind as rents rise in some of the hotter markets. The National Association of Realtors, which compiles an index of housing affordability, says that although home prices rose in the first quarter, the typical household had 144.1% of the income needed to purchase an existing home at the median price of $170,800. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara Ciment, a broker in the Washington region, hears from out- of-town buyers that the market is slowing in other areas. She hasn't seen any signs that buyers are backing off. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ciment sold a house Monday for more than the asking price of $550,000. The winning bidder agreed not to make the sale contingent on a home inspection or appraisal. "They took it as is," she says. "Things aren't slowing down."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Existing home sales jumped a surprisingly strong 2.5% in April to the second-highest monthly sales rate on record as consumers rushed to beat rising mortgage rates, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm very bullish," says Van Davis, CEO of Century 21 Real Estate, adding he expects sales to remain strong throughout the year, given high demand, a tight inventory-to-sales ratio and 30- year mortgage rates that, while up nearly a percentage point since March, are still historically modest at about 6.2%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report Tuesday, the New York-based Conference Board said consumer confidence has been virtually unchanged in May, rising to 93.2 from 93.0 in April. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said the number of consumers expecting business conditions to improve in the next six months rose to 22.9% from 20.8% in April. The percentage expecting more jobs to become available in the next six months rose to 19.2% from 18.3%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures are based on a monthly survey of 5,000 households. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center said federal reports showing strong employment gains in March and April helped lift consumers' spirits. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pickup in the job market is offsetting the impact of rising gas prices and escalating tensions overseas," Franco says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market once again exceeded expectations, as sales of previously owned homes in April hit a 6.64 million seasonally adjusted annual rate. Sales were up more than 15% from a year ago, and the median price, at $176,000, was 7.3% higher than in April 2003. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The April figure was close to the monthly record rate of 6.68 million in September 2003, surprising economists, who had expected a dip in sales. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Midwest and South showed the biggest sales gains during the month. But the greatest price appreciation was along the two coasts. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price in the Northeast was $214,100, up 19.3% from a year ago, while the West's median price of $257,300 was 11.5% above last year. In the Midwest, the median was $143,200, up 5.3% and the South's $162,900 median reflected a 7% price rise. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said many of the sales recorded in April took place earlier, before the full run-up in mortgage rates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But anecdotal evidence and the pace of mortgage applications in May suggest the market remains pretty strong. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It seems doubtful that rates have moved high enough yet to put a serious dent in home sales. That day may come, but only at substantially higher rate levels," says Steven Stanley of Greenwich Capital Markets.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When builder Bobby Rayburn came to tiny Walnut Grove, Miss., and proposed 28 apartments that workers at a youth correctional facility and a poultry plant could afford to live in, town officials seemed receptive. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the public hearing. Thirty homeowners in the town of 488 people showed up to protest. They expressed a common worry that the character of their community would be ruined. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"An hour and a half later, we're changing sites and moving to another community," says Rayburn, president of the National Association of Home Builders. As a result, guards at the correctional facility and managers of the hatchery in Walnut Grove will continue to live more than 50 miles away. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordable housing projects often encounter strident opposition across the USA. But a poll conducted for the National Association of Realtors and scheduled for release today suggests a wider public acceptance of such projects. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The survey shows an amazing level of support," says Steven Hornburg, a national housing strategist in Arlington, Va., who helped develop the Realtors' survey. "The folks who don't like it are the ones who show up and scream. They're a vocal minority." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A growing number of interest groups want to tap the silent majority that may embrace cheaper housing for workers who serve their communities. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of housing that people can buy with 30% of their income or less -- a common definition of affordability -- is shrinking as real estate prices rise steadily and interest rates nudge upward. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many metropolitan areas, full-time workers can't afford to buy or rent close to their jobs. As gas prices climb above $2 a gallon, long commutes eat up more household income. In some markets, many families are spending half of their incomes on housing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are beginning to understand that affordable housing is about having a place to live for people waiting on us in restaurants, behind the counter at the library, teaching our kids and even providing security," says Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordable housing is an issue for people such as Jonas and Carolina Ramirez and their son, Andrew, 5. Jonas is an executive chef for a food service company in Providence, Carolina a senior service representative at a bank. Together, they earn $70,000 a year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They moved from New York because housing was too expensive there. They heard from relatives that the Providence market was more affordable. But that was before high-speed train service to Boston began attracting commuters who can't afford the astronomical housing prices there. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I had no idea," Jonas says. "We thought in Rhode Island the houses were affordable." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took them four months to find a home they could afford -- a 1930s house in Pawtucket, R.I. -- although it cost more than they had hoped to pay. Six years ago, his cousin had paid $109,000 for a similar home two blocks away. The Ramirezes were happy to get their house for $291,000. Their monthly mortgage payment will be $2,400, but they hope to rent out the upstairs part of the house for $1,000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Six years ago, the average sale price was below $125,000," says Ron Phipps a Realtor in nearby Warwick. "Today, we're over $225,000." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several groups are promoting affordable housing: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The National Association of Counties is launching an initiative to increase the supply. "We at the local-elected-official level are the individuals who will allow or disallow the opportunity for affordable housing based on our zoning," says Angelo Kyle, a county board member in Lake County, Ill., near Chicago, and incoming president of the association. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The National Association of Home Builders is helping 30 communities through its Housing America's Working Families program. Builders say development-impact fees, zoning laws that restrict density and too many regulations make it hard to get projects off the ground. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Big-city mayors are becoming strong advocates. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino made affordable housing the centerpiece of his term as head of the U.S. Conference of Mayors last year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rybak, the Minneapolis mayor, was vocal about the issue during his campaign. One-fourth of 3,000 housing units built since he became mayor less than three years ago are affordable to people earning less than 50% of the metro area's median household income of $76,000 a year. Projects in which 20% of the units are that affordable get tax credits and can build more units than the zoning allows. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's both a carrot and a stick that government needs to use," Rybak says.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans are so worried about skyrocketing home prices that most say they would support more affordable housing in their neighborhoods -- and even next door, according to a survey to be released today. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings challenge conventional wisdom that neighborhood opposition is a barrier to cheaper housing. Builders, local officials and housing experts have long said that "not-in-my- backyard" opposition -- based on fear that affordable housing lowers property values -- is one of the main reasons apartments, town homes and small houses don't get built. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey "tells me that more people know about affordable housing problems than we might have thought," says Walt McDonald, president of the National Association of Realtors, which commissioned last month's poll of 1,000 adults in the 25 most populous metropolitan areas. Among the findings: 76% say they would support affordable housing in their community, and 63% would support it next door. This is the first time the Realtors' survey has asked where such housing would be acceptable. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results may be a sign that the high cost of housing is hitting closer to home for many Americans. In many communities, teachers, nurses, police officers and firefighters can't afford to live where they work. The survey also shows that more than half of Americans worry that their children, grandchildren and other relatives can't afford to live close to them. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the survey reflects political correctness rather than genuine attitudes, housing experts say it's a sign that the outcry over the lack of affordable homes is no longer coming only from advocates for the poor and unemployed. A recent study by one advocacy group shows that while homeownership has soared to record highs, the rate among working families with children has dropped. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're America's public servants," says Angelo Kyle, a county board member in Lake County, Ill., near Chicago, and incoming president of the National Association of Counties, which is launching a "Homeownership for Heroes" initiative to support cheaper housing. "It's also our seniors. It's also our soldiers. When they come back from Iraq, are they going to have the opportunity to own a home on military salaries?" </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large lobbying groups, including Realtors, builders and employers, are clamoring for government programs and changes in zoning and regulations to encourage construction of affordable housing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concern is no surprise to Susan Mekenney, who sells real estate in the Washington, D.C., area, where the median sales price of single-family homes exceeds $300,000. She tried to find a home for first-time buyers who earn about $50,000 a year. They wanted a condominium for no more than $200,000. They looked for six months. They're still renting. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's almost impossible," Mekenney says. "We have to come to terms with it." </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- With mortgage rates rising, the superheated housing market -- which set another record in March -- should finally cool down. After it soars even higher, that is. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and industry experts are preparing for a shakeout in the housing sector, which has outperformed the overall economy for several years. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise short-term interest rates as early as this summer to keep inflation in check. Mortgage rates have moved up since early April in anticipation of Fed action. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the short run, home sales and construction could rise even faster as consumers rush to buy. The Commerce Department said Monday that new home sales hit a record in March, jumping 8.9% from the previous month and 21.8% from a year ago. (Those numbers don't reflect the recent rise in mortgage rates.) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the longer term, prices and sales should rise more slowly. They could fall in some areas on the East and West coasts if rates rise faster than expected or the economy falters. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists and experts dispute the notion that a national home price "bubble" is about to burst, pointing to wide regional price and supply variations. Still, even optimists see turbulence ahead. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're going to have anybody and everybody who was ever interested in even thinking of buying a home jumping in" as rates rise, says Robert Toll, CEO of Toll Bros., a builder of luxury homes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Here's hoping it leads to a soft landing," says Toll, who expects home building to eventually slow for six months to a year, then pick up to roughly current levels. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices nationally have risen about 30% in the past four years, well above inflation. Sales have set records, and housing construction is more robust than it has been in decades. Still, the market varies around the country. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices vary by region </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home price appreciation from late-2002 to late-2003 was near 29% in Riverside/San Bernardino, Calif., where the median price hit $239,400, and 26% in Sarasota, Fla., where prices were $222,100, according to the National Association of Realtors. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, prices declined in cities such as Akron, Ohio, and Fort Wayne, Ind. Prices ranged from $83,800 in Buffalo/Niagara Falls to San Francisco, where the median price was $574,300. Overall, prices in metro areas rose 14.5% in the Northeast and 11.1% in the West, but just 2.3% in the Midwest and 4.8% in the South. The group expects national prices to gain 4.4% this year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Southern California, the median home price hit $371,000 in March, up 23.3% from a year ago -- the biggest jump in 15 years -- according to DataQuick Information Systems, which tracks real estate trends. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Two-thirds of the country has a normal real estate market right now," says Van Davis, CEO of Century 21 Real Estate. "Most of the craziness is limited to those areas where you can't create new supply." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dean Baker, co-director of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Economic and Policy Research, says even with regional differences, the nation has developed a threatening price bubble. "We haven't seen a nationwide decline in home prices before . . . but we've never seen this kind of run-up in home prices," Baker says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many others, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, discount that notion. Economists say that while rates are rising, the economy is expanding, not contracting, which will buoy markets; monthly mortgage payments are manageable; housing markets are local, not national; and there aren't broad signs of speculative buying. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean things won't cool off, or even fall in some places. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When the interest rate goes up, everything else being the same, prices have to come down," said Youguo Liang, managing director of research for Prudential Real Estate Investors. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at interest rates, income growth and other factors, Prudential expects median home price increases to slow to a 2.5% to 3% annual pace. But Liang cautions that the outlook hinges on how far, and fast, rates move. If 30-year mortgages, at 5.94% in the week ended Thursday, quickly shoot past 7%, high-priced areas on each coast could see stagnation or declines. Thirty-year mortgages went below 5.5% in March. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warning of 'bubblettes' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, warns of housing "bubblettes" that could pop in Southern California and Florida and on the East Coast, from Boston to Washington, D.C. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, while saying there is little risk of a national housing-price bubble, says markets are vulnerable in the Northeast and Pacific states, if local economies weaken. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with such predictions, consumers are unsure how to bet. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are seriously on the fence at this point about whether we should gamble and rent on the hope home prices will go down," said Lars Riishojgaard, who recently sold his house in a Washington, D.C., suburb for well above the asking price. Existing home prices in the area are up nearly 20% from last year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While low mortgage rates are a big factor, the housing market has been supported by population growth, including strong immigration, and short supply in some areas. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's no question low mortgage rates have been a factor. Thirty-year mortgage rates have been under 6% for most months since January 2003. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mortgage Bankers Association expects 30-year mortgage rates to rise to 6.9% in 2006, with new housing starts declining to 1.6 million annually from the nearly 2 million current pace. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane Saatchi, vice president of sales for the realty firm The Corcoran Group, predicts 30-year mortgage rates could reach 7% to 8% in the next 12 to 18 months. Toll also sees rates eventually rising to 8% or higher. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Saatchi sees continued strong demand in New York's Hamptons, the pricey section on Long Island where she concentrates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you look at the people buying second homes out there, it's largely people in their 50s and 60s who are probably the wealthiest they're ever going to be," Saatchi says.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOULDER, Colo. -- When Susan Whitehurst moved from Laramie, Wyo., to this university community at the height of the Vietnam War, she found a town with a counterculture feel and prices to match. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was trendy, hippie, much smaller, much cheaper," says Whitehurst, 57, a hospital admissions clerk. "You could get a house for $30,000 or $40,000. I didn't, but I should have." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many communities along Colorado's Rocky Mountain foothills, Boulder has boomed in the intervening decades. Drawing new residents with its scenic mountain backdrop, thousands of acres of protected open space, a vibrant cultural life and a quirky downtown centered on the University of Colorado, Boulder has become one of the state's most attractive, and most expensive, places to live. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of living </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a problem common to some of the West's most desirable places: The well-to-do are crowding out the middle and working classes, and the cost of living is becoming prohibitive for teachers, civil servants and others. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boulder has a median household income of nearly $74,000 and a median home cost that hit $500,000 early this year. Officials are struggling to keep their city of 94,673 -- in the news lately for a university football scandal -- from becoming an enclave of the affluent. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, they took the unusual step of adjusting the city's definition of "working poor" so more people qualify for subsidized housing. Begun in 1991, the city's affordable-housing program requires that 20% of new developments be set aside for low-income households. The goal is to have 10% of the housing stock be "permanently affordable." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applicants had to have an income equal to 30% to 60% of the city's median income. But with incomes at the top rising faster than those near the bottom, fewer people could participate. So Boulder cut the lower threshold to 15% of median income. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's supply and demand," says Jann Oldham, the city's program director for housing and community development. "Boulder has a very high quality of life, in a beautiful location, and that attracts folks." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Providing housing for the less affluent is also a struggle elsewhere in Colorado. The state gained a million residents during the 1990s (an increase of more than 30%) and saw home costs increase by 101% -- compared with wage increases of 56%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, communities as different as Aspen and Denver have had to bolster affordable-housing programs. Aspen, the state's premier ski resort, where the median home price approaches $3 million, has built more than 1,700 affordable units so workers and middle-class residents can remain. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver, a new "workforce housing" program requires developers of many projects to include low-cost housing and is expected to produce 800 units of affordable housing over three years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boulder's extensive system of open space, parks and trails -- about 40,000 acres in and around the city -- contribute both to its attractiveness and its housing problem. Also contributing to the housing squeeze is a local growth ordinance that caps new housing starts at 1% a year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whitehurst, the hospital clerk who has lived here since 1969, says that without the affordable-housing program "I'd have to live in Nebraska and commute in." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, she was able to buy her one-bedroom condominium for $83,000 through the program. At market rates in Boulder, "you can't buy a single-car garage for under $100,000," she says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one downside: her condo can appreciate only 3% a year under program rules. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sticker shock </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just the working poor who have a hard time finding housing in Boulder, but the middle class as well. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Derek Eilers, a mechanical engineer, moved to Colorado about 16 months ago from Michigan. He quickly encountered a double whammy: a 20% cut in pay and far higher housing costs. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drawn by the mountains and the close-in recreational opportunities, Eilers and his girlfriend, a chemist, rented in Boulder and began looking to buy their first home. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An avid outdoorsman and competitive cyclist who races with a Denver-area team, Eilers wanted to be in Boulder because "it's a great place for training for cycling, it's an active city, and we are two active people." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They quickly found that a two-bedroom home in one of Boulder's least-expensive neighborhoods, with no basement and no garage, would cost $300,000. They ended up buying closer to Denver. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth Hotard, vice president of the Boulder Area Realtor Association, says it's not uncommon for potential homeowners to start looking in Boulder but ultimately determine it's better to buy in other communities nearby. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But D.B. Wilson, a Realtor with Re/Max of Boulder, says there is still no shortage of buyers, particularly from the East and West coasts where real estate markets remain red hot. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Just the other day I had somebody from Boston, someone from New Jersey and a couple from California, and all three were saying how much house they can buy," Wilson says.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominiums, the long-suffering stepchild of the U.S. housing market, have come of age. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In big cities and across the Sun Belt, condo sales are booming, and prices are up smartly. For many, condos conjure an image of cramped living, high-priced parking and mettlesome building associations. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they're hot because they're still affordable, and they meet the demands of baby boomers and Generation X buyers for low maintenance and convenient, hip, urban locations. They've moved in the last few years from laggard to leader in a national housing market that took off a decade ago and has been kept strong by high demand and low mortgage rates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time, the price midpoint for condos in the final quarter of 2003 topped that of detached single-family homes -- $174,700 vs. $171,600, the National Association of Realtors has reported. Sales volume is growing faster than that of single-family homes and is closing in on 1 million units per year, NAR says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dawn Keer is among recent buyers fueling the condo boom in Philadelphia's Center City district. Age 32 and single, she sold her suburban townhouse last year and moved into a $262,000 downtown condo with about half the living space. The attraction: the neighborhood's night life, cultural amenities and walkability. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For me, it's where I had been spending my time anyway," says Keer, who works in radio sales and marketing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Genevieve Hanson, also 32, expresses similar motivation for her recent purchase of a $300,000, two-level loft in Logan Circle, a revitalized neighborhood in Washington, D.C. The neighborhood's diversity and proximity to cafes and culture attracted her. "I definitely like the feel of living in the city," says Hanson, who drives 30 minutes to her job as a management consultant in suburban Virginia. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women and first-timers </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos are the housing of choice for many single women, says research by the National Association of Realtors. About one-third of condo buyers are single women, vs. about one-fifth of single-family homebuyers, says NAR. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR research shows condos also are popular with first-time buyers seeking a foothold in the fast-appreciating residential real estate market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I tell all my first-time borrowers they need to get on the (real estate) merry-go-round," says zipRealty agent Helen Ross, who sells in the suburbs of Washington. As often as not, she says, that means a condo. Even then, condos aren't cheap -- just cheaper. In suburban Reston, Va., Ross says, condos can be found in the low $200,000 range, about half the entry price for a detached home. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ted and Naomi Bardacke are first-time home buyers who opted for a condo when they moved from New York to Southern California. Their 1,000-square-foot condo in Santa Monica cost $425,000, but Ted Bardacke says it's worth it. He can walk 10 minutes to his job as an urban planner for a non-profit environmental group. The beach and shopping are in walking distance, too, allowing them to get along with one vehicle in the USA's most auto-centric region. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As former renters, the couple are comfortable with apartment- style living, he says. And, he says, they are likely to do fine if and when they sell. "I don't know what's happening to the market for condos, but I do know they're not making any more beach," he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, Creed Pettit, 27, says his new $550,000 condo in nearby Marina del Rey is a bargain compared with single-family homes in the neighborhood. "You'd be looking at $1 million-plus," says Pettit, sales director at a technology company. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Easy upkeep </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos are popular with empty-nesters and retirees seeking a reprieve from the upkeep of a single-family home, says NAR research. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm done with yard work," says Tom Gorman, a Los Angeles Times editor who returned to Southern California last year after a stint as a Las Vegas-based correspondent. Their children now grown, Gorman and wife, Jeanne, both 52, bought their first condo. It's a $350,000 "fixer-upper" in Laguna Hills, where they could have expected to pay more than $400,000 for the cheapest single-family home. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ross, the Northern Virginia agent, says she frequently sells condos to baby boomers who are replacing big family homes with two residences. "They've already bought their beach house, and now they want a condo close to the city," she says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How vibrant is the condo market? Some indicators: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* More condos sold in 2003 than any other year. According to a report by NAR, 898,000 existing condos sold last year, up 9.5% from 2002, and the eighth-consecutive volume record. Condo resales have grown so much, they nearly match the number of new detached single- family homes that sell each year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite some year-end easing in sales, NAR chief economist David Lereah said volume remains "exceptionally high." Said Lereah: "There's a tremendous momentum that will be driving the condo market again this year." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Prices are surging. According to NAR, the median price -- the sales midpoint -- for condo resales last year rose to $163,800, a shade below the $169,900 median for single-family homes. The 15.2% annual rise in the median price for condos was about double the rate of increase for single-family homes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* It's not just resales. The market for new condos is strong. John Burns, an Irvine, Calif.-based home building industry consultant, estimates condos now represent 5% to 10% of the output of publicly traded building companies. Some are building to meet the incredible demand for housing at the low end of the price range, he said. Other builders are catering to an increasing demand for luxury condos. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high end is hot </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philadelphia real estate broker Allan Domb, who booked $207 million in condo sales in 2002, has seen the market for high-end condos explode. The Lippincott, a converted publishing building set to open this spring, has sold 25 of its 27 units without advertising, Domb says. Prices: $650,000 to $3.5 million. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas and Miami are seeing the boom in high-end condos, too. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury builders Toll Brothers and Pinnacle last month announced plans for a posh, 832-unit condominium development on the Hudson River in Hoboken, N.J. Plans call for a series of high- and midrise buildings across the river from Manhattan on the former Maxwell House Coffee site. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll Brothers Vice President Doug Yearley says condominiums -- both urban and suburban -- promise to make up an increasing share of the company's output. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The demographics are pointing that way," Yearley says. Also driving the trend, he says, is intensifying opposition from no- growth advocates on the fringes of many big cities. Condos, particularly in urban areas, carry land costs that are a fraction of what Toll pays for its traditional sprawling developments, Yearley says. Also, city governments welcome the developments as a way to renew their urban cores, he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A modern phenomenon </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominiums are a phenomenon of the last quarter-century. They began to stir in the late 1970s as the leading edge of the baby boom generation reached house-buying age. It helped that apartment developers had overbuilt in many cities and were eager to sell their units rather than endure high vacancy rates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During housing market downturns, condo values have been quicker to fall and slower to recover than single-family homes. Condos' traditional role as the entry point into the housing market made their market values more vulnerable to economic vagaries than traditional homes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen Freepartner, a veteran zipRealty broker-agent in Orange County, Calif., watched the cycle play out in Southern California through the last decade. The broad housing market started to recover from its notorious 1991 swoon about mid-decade. But condo sales didn't gain momentum until about 1999, she says. Now, she says, condo prices have nearly tripled since 1996. And in housing-short Orange County, condos sell as soon as they come on the market, she says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Karevoll, analyst at market tracker DataQuick, says condos are now seeing the boom that other segments of the housing market -- luxury and move-up homes, for example -- experienced earlier in the current housing cycle. For those just now buying into the market, the delayed rally in condos is a good thing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Condos probably have a little more upside in front of them than does the rest of the market," he says. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is a condo? </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most condos look like they could be rental apartments. But a condominium is a form of property ownership, not a style of architecture. A condo buyer takes ownership of a single unit in what typically is a multiunit building. The owners of the individual units jointly own the building exterior and common areas. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In tracking the condo market, the National Association of Realtors includes a similar form of ownership common in New York City -- the co-operative. Co-op buyers acquire a share of ownership in the building and grounds, entitling them to live in one of the units.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, the International Builders' Show, the annual gathering of construction industry professionals, is underway in Las Vegas, and the mood is festive. These guys have had a great run during the past half-dozen years, capped by 2003, when sales of new single- family homes reached a million for the first time and existing home sales surpassed the 6-million mark. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, those in the housing-construction and real estate industries have a right to boast that the sort-of recession we're sort of pulling out of would have been far more dismal without the robust growth in their sector. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a countercurrent beneath the elation, however. It's an old problem -- housing affordability -- with a dramatic new twist. This time, instead of a debate over how best to provide housing for the lowest-income earners, it will be about creating and preserving communities that have room for most of the rest of us. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I live in rural western North Carolina, not far from the Cold Mountain mythologized in the current movie. We've gotten a glimpse of the future with regard to housing affordability. Our county, Macon, with a year-round population of 30,000 and nearly half its land area given over to national forest, has done well by the building industry. People want to live in these mountains. And those with the means to transplant themselves, either for the summer or more permanently in retirement, have created a boom in real estate and construction. Between the 1990 and 2000 Censuses, Macon County's population grew by 27%. Thanks largely to the construction boom, unemployment is low: 3.6% for the first 11 months in 2003 compared with a national average of 6.05%. Per capita income has increased. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem: Demand is driving up the cost of housing much faster than incomes. In 2002, the average new construction cost of a Macon County home, as reported by contractors to the county, was $222,000. A conventional mortgage applicant with a 20% down payment needed an income 24% higher than Macon County's median to purchase a house at the price. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so it goes nationally. From 1990 to 2001, the median house price increased at almost double the rate of the median income. And the future looks ominous. An analysis by Fannie Mae Foundation's Zhong Yi Tong suggests that by 2007, a household earning the median income won't be able to qualify for a mortgage for the median- priced U.S. home. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Macon County, many workers cope with the affordability crunch by commuting, as many other Americans must. They go up the mountain to the county's most affluent community to build and remodel houses, then return home to affordable territory. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But higher housing costs are creeping down the mountain. Many workers who build those homes -- and their friends who are teachers, nurses and law enforcement officers -- worry they'll soon be squeezed out of the market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This experience is being replicated throughout the country. Cities sprawl into suburbs, which sprawl toward rural enclaves as people fight to balance lives that require them to go "up the mountain" for their jobs and down at night to neighborhoods where new demand is forcing housing prices up. People who consider themselves middle class suddenly find themselves talking about affordable housing without much hope that old ways of addressing affordability -- which relied on federal grants for new construction and subsidies -- will reach them. Even if federal and state agencies weren't strapped for funds, the numbers would overwhelm the top- down approach. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates 12 million renter and homeowner households spend more than half of their incomes on housing. Those will be the folks first in line for help. Millions more will need creative and collaborative programs to claim their place in communities. The alternative is gloomy: monocultures segregated by income and robbed of the vitality necessary for economic and cultural growth. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preventing this kind of devolution requires careful thought that results in affordable housing being interwoven into communities before they are developed. If the lack of affordable housing aggravates sprawl by pushing people out further in search of cheaper homes, anti-sprawl weapons -- increased density in urban centers and mixed-use neighborhoods with a variety of housing options, for instance -- may work. But this is a complicated, messy issue. Without an integrated plan for affordable housing, for example, anti- sprawl measures that reduce the amount of land available for development can make matters worse by escalating land values and, therefore, housing prices. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One community enthusiastic about new approaches to affordable housing is the host city for the builders' show, Las Vegas. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas is a boomtown. "When I got here in 1964," Mayor Oscar B. Goodman says, "the population was 70,000. Now it's 1.4 million. We're building a new home here every 23 minutes." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As housing costs rise with demand, "I want to make sure the average Joe can live in our community and make the most important purchase of his life," Goodman says. "And I'm not talking just about those at the lowest end of the income scale. I'm talking about the lawyer just starting out, the schoolteacher and the recent grad up to the hilt in debt because of student loans. They're the backbone of our community. If we lose them, we lose everything that galvanizes us as a society." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goodman hosted two symposia last year at which experts debated how to ensure housing affordability. The city is close, he says, to "cutting some dramatic deals" with developers to weave affordability into key projects. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They don't have a choice," the mayor says. "If they want to do business with our city, they'll do what we say." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's debate: Internet home sales </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our view: As Web changes the marketplace, buyers deserve to see benefits. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than a century, America's real estate agents have pooled the homes for sale in a specific area into a Multiple Listing Service (MLS). The listings, jointly owned by local realty firms, link buyers and sellers in a large, common marketplace. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now these same brokers have concluded that cooperation has its limits. Starting Jan. 1, a new rule by the National Association of Realtors will allow agents at traditional firms to deny listings to an innovative breed of discount Internet brokers who are slashing the average 5% to 7% commissions Realtors long have charged. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move rightly prompted an antitrust investigation last month by the U.S. Justice Department and threats of lawsuits by Net brokers. Limiting access to listings harms consumers by turning a competitive marketplace into an exclusive club rigged to preserve high fees. It also shows the failure of traditional brokers to adapt to new economic realities. Instead of learning from their upstart rivals how to harness the Internet to streamline their work and attract new clients, they are trying to erect a wall to protect an outmoded business model. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Internet brings undeniable efficiencies to commission-based industries. Web sites such as Expedia and Travelocity have slashed travel agent commissions on domestic travel from 10% to less than 1% in many cases. Similarly, stock brokerage commissions have dropped dramatically with the arrival of online firms such as Charles Schwab and E-Trade. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, traditional realty agents are doing all they can to prevent the efficiencies of the Internet from benefiting home buyers and sellers -- or undercutting their lock on the real estate business. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internet brokers have shown that some buyers are willing to do their initial home search online so agents can spend more time selling homes at smaller commissions. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Results include: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Lower fees. Detroit-based Home Quarters charges fees for listing homes that are as low as 3%, compared with a national average for traditional brokers of 5.12%. In less than 6 months, the business has grown to 60 full-time employees. Some of its top agents are selling 16 homes per month, according to CEO Kyle Hoylman. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* More Information. Houston-based eRealty uses the Internet not just to post listings but also to provide data that can be used to track the market. These include neighborhood trends in prices, the average periods homes stay on the market and up-to-the-minute listings. Five years in business, it is now in 13 markets and has sold more than 1,000 homes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditional brokers say their commissions are justified by the personal service they offer, along with their expertise and offices customers can visit. They also say the MLS lists are valuable private property that they have compiled to use as they see fit. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the value of the MLS lists stems from the fact that local realty firms band together to create a single database of properties in an area. Denying that list to upstart firms that pay appropriate dues and follow reasonable rules only hurts competition. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of whether the Realtors' effort to thwart online competitors survives a court challenge, traditional brokers have a tough fight justifying exorbitant charges in the Internet age. They would be well advised to take a cue from their rivals instead of pursuing an anti-consumer course. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's debate: Internet home sales </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opposing view: Real estate agents have right to control who has access to listings. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today more than 2 million homes are listed for sale on the nation's 900 Realtor-association-owned-and-operated Multiple Listing Services. The services help home sellers reach the largest possible markets and make the full range of properties for sale in a given marketplace easily available to homebuyers. They're one reason the U.S. residential property market is the most efficient in the world. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listings that comprise MLS databases are submitted by real estate professionals who work hard to obtain their clients and market their properties for them. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New rules recently approved by the National Association of Realtors (NAR) will allow real estate brokers who operate Web sites called VOWs -- or virtual office Web sites -- to make available on those Web sites not only their own property listings but also the listings of other brokers included in the MLS. The new rules will make it possible for consumers who register with the brokers of their choice to search and review online most of the same information that is available to real estate professionals. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR's policy incorporates the common-sense principle that the broker who worked hard to obtain listings ought to have, and does retain, the right to control on what other Web sites those listings will appear. This provision allows the broker to protect a seller's privacy. It also preserves the broker's right to market listings as he or she sees fit, so that, for example, those listings do not appear on Web sites the broker determines are inappropriate. In light of listing brokers' fiduciary responsibilities to their customers, it's likely this provision will be rarely exercised, if at all. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its birth in the 19th century, when real estate brokers traded listings on 3-by-5 cards, the MLS system has been built on trust. As the Information Age makes the real estate business even more efficient and transparent, trust among professionals and between Realtors and their clients remains the foundation of our business. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that reason, we believe that the MLS system will continue to serve real estate buyers and sellers as well in the future as it has in the past. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FONTANA, Calif. -- Stacey and Sean Castillo are part of a vanishing group in sky-high housing markets like Southern California: first-time buyers. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, in their early 30s, last February managed to buy a $221,000 starter house in this distant Los Angeles suburb, where home prices have been advancing 28% a year. Similar houses in the neighborhood now fetch close to $300,000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond their perfect timing, the Castillos represent much of what it takes these days to overcome barriers to homeownership: They're a two-income household with 100% financing for a house far outside the coastal counties of Orange and Los Angeles. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When home prices revved up in the nation's big-city markets in the mid-1990s, renters had to travel deeper into the suburbs to find an affordable house to buy or take a fixer-upper close in. Now, nothing's cheap. The result: Shoppers in high-priced markets who can't bring equity from a previous home to the closing table are increasingly being locked out of the market. Their choice: move to an affordable city or face a lifetime of renting. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unless you already have a house, it's hard to get a house," says Stacey Castillo, 33, a hospital department manager. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the affordability problem is most acute in California, strong price growth across the USA is creating similar situations elsewhere. First-time buyers in Boston, New York, Miami and Honolulu face similar barriers. Consulting firm Economy.com in West Chester, Pa., calculates that in 34 metropolitan areas, the typical household lacks sufficient income to buy the typical house. That's up from 14 metro areas in 1999. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet dire affordability problems are not the norm nationally. Ultralow mortgage rates -- less than 6% for most of the past year -- have trumped rising prices in most markets. First-time buyers represent 40% of the national market, down from 42% in 1999, reports the National Association of Realtors. And a Harvard University study issued in June said buyers nationally are committing 21% of their income to house payments, far below the peak of 36% in 1981. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tough choices </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Southern California, the rapid run-up in prices is forcing tough choices for close-in renters who aspire to own a home. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Martinez, 40, plans to give up his apartment in Orange County and buy a house in the next several months so his two children can have their own space. There's no way he can manage the $650,000 he estimates it would cost for a house nearby, he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martinez, who isn't married, will give up his three-block walk to the Pacific Ocean and 20-minute drive to work and move 60 miles out into Riverside County. Even there, Martinez says, he expects to pay more than $250,000. "I like it here (in Orange County) more, but not $400,000 more," he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victoria and Kris Nielsen, in their 40s and also from Orange County, have suspended their house search in the same distant area where Martinez has been looking. Family, church and Kris Nielsen's 10-minute commute have them deeply rooted in their community of Mission Viejo -- enough that they're willing to continue renting. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are likely to get back into the market in a year or so, Victoria Nielsen says, if prices in the distant communities remain within reach. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent study by the California Association of Realtors (CAR) finds that 31% of home buyers in the state are first-timers, down from 42% in 1999. The slide is not hard to explain. The statewide median price for single-family homes in August for the first time punched through $400,000, more than double the national figure. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To a large extent, they're going to be stuck as renters," economist John Husing says of the broad swath of young families struggling to get a house and build wealth. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAR Chief Economist Leslie Appleton-Young is equally dire: "I don't think we're going to pull out of our affordability dive." Appleton-Young projects that in 2004 just 19% of Californians will have sufficient income to buy an average house. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long way home </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But like the Castillos, some first-time buyers have taken the leap. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment dwellers for 33 years, Margo and Austin Culbert in July moved into a $200,000 new house. To get that price, the Culberts moved to Victorville, a Mojave Desert town long viewed by Angelinos as a gas stop on the way to Las Vegas, not a suburb. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victorville now is booming as builders find some of the last cheap land in Southern California, and buyers remain willing to drive as far as 75 miles to work. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 40-mile move from an apartment in Fontana added 15 minutes to Austin Culbert's 90-minute commute. And they drive two hours every Sunday to get to their Los Angeles church. But they have no regrets. "I can't tell you how happy I am," Margo Culbert says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Culberts combined savings and a large income-tax refund for a down payment. They financed 97% of the purchase. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ZipRealty agent Laszlo Gregor says just one of his past 20 sales involved a down payment of 20%. With first-time buyers, he says, it's rare to see more than 5% down. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregor and colleagues who work with first-time buyers agreed during an interview last week that increasing flexibility by mortgage lenders has at least permitted Southern Californians with strong work histories and good credit to get a first home. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agent Ingrid Nadon says, for example, that lenders no longer require that house-related debt consume no more than 33% of income and total debt, no more than 38%. Nadon says she has seen loans with payments as much as 50% of income if the borrower can show a history of setting that much aside for rent and savings. "They've had to be more creative," she says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Vice President Stuart Tyrie says his company has added more lending programs with low or no down payments. He says the company isn't taking inordinate risks. Home- buyer education and quick intervention when payments lag have made the programs successful, he says. "The less money someone has in the house, the more we want to make sure they understand the obligations and privileges they have," Tyrie says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giant mortgage investors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have encouraged higher leveraging of home purchases by implementing 100% financing for lower-income buyers with good credit. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Default rates are "just slightly above average," says Fannie Mae Vice President Julie Gould. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's not helping much in Southern California, the agents say, is the array of mortgage programs and down-payment subsidies from government and non-profit groups. Some programs have outdated limits on home values. Others have bureaucratic requirements that make them too slow to help buyers in a market where few properties remain for sale longer than two weeks. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim and Holly Murphy are scheduled to close this month on a $315,000 house in inland Temecula. They bought the house -- their first -- after concluding they could afford nothing suitable in their hometown of San Diego. The Murphys are borrowing 100% of the cost, an 80% first mortgage and a 20% second mortgage at a higher interest rate. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increasingly popular two-loan approach sidesteps costly insurance for single-mortgage debt greater than 80% of the home's value. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Murphy, 33, remembers the last time home prices crashed. Precipitated by defense layoffs, home values plummeted in the early 1990s and spent most of the decade regaining momentum. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Murphy, who sells artificial grass, doesn't think his 100% mortgage could leave him with more debt than his home is worth. "It's one of the fastest-growing areas in the state," he says of the Riverside County area where he's moving. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murphy's confidence probably isn't misplaced, builders and housing economists say. The surge in prices is a reflection of demand soaring above supply, which seems unlikely to change, most agree. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KB Home CEO Bruce Karatz, whose building company targets first- time buyers, says his industry each year has supplied Californians with 75,000 to 100,000 fewer homes than the market could absorb. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry, he says, is boxed in by high land costs, government building fees and political opposition to development by Californians who already own homes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has a major development in Victorville and another planned even farther outside Los Angeles. It also builds townhouses and condominiums, which bring prices down by amortizing land costs over more residences. But Karatz says high-density housing succeeds only in coastal counties. Elsewhere, he says, home buyers expect space. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But inland builder John Young says affordability problems have reached the point that he plans to diversify into multifamily homes. To buy and prepare land for construction on a single-family lot in Fontana, Young estimates he spends $67,000. Only by spreading that cost over several homes is there hope of returning new home sales to the sub-$200,000 range. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher-density building </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But higher density is no easy fix. CAR economist Appleton-Young says such development plans are frequently squelched by neighbors. And many builders are scared off by the threat of being sued for defective construction, lawsuits that are more easily brought by buyers of townhouses and condos. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Syphax, CEO at non-profit Nehemiah Corp. of California, a housing advocate, says higher-density home building will be necessary if California is to make housing affordable. And that, he says, means changing the prevailing notion that homeownership involves "a split-level ranch on a quarter-acre."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's finances are a mess. The governor faces a recall election Tuesday. The state's unemployment rate outstrips the nation's. People are leaving for other states. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But California's legendary steep housing prices keep rising. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of an existing single-family home will jump 13% from this year's $366,450 to a record $414,100 next year, the California Association of Realtors predicted last week. The U.S. median is $168,900. The median is the point at which half of homes cost more and half cost less. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hefty increases in housing prices in the nation's most populous state have a ripple effect. Californians who move to other states arrive cash-rich from the sale of their high-priced real estate and push prices up in more affordable markets. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you come from California, Phoenix looks like a bargain," says Robert Lang, director of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend also is playing out in the East. People leaving New York, Boston, Washington and other areas where housing is costly are fueling increases in Atlanta and other Southern cities. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a residence in a once-blighted section of Atlanta grew from $87,191 in 1996 to $183,251 in 2002, according to an analysis by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The newspaper reported that like Los Angeles, the city is becoming a place where only the wealthy and the very poor, who have subsidized housing, can afford to live. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say there's no end in sight to rising housing prices in California. Housing construction in the state is not keeping up with population growth. The California real estate group says that the state typically gains 250,000 households a year but will build only 190,000 housing units next year. The shortage and low mortgage rates are keeping sales brisk. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rapid escalation in prices is blocking many Californians from buying a home. The state real estate group estimates that the proportion of families that can afford a median-priced home will drop from 27% this year to 19% in 2004. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rest of the country ought to care," says Shekar Narasimhan, chairman of the Campaign for Affordable Housing, a non-profit advocacy group based in San Francisco. "It's the largest economy in the U.S. and the fifth largest in the world. It's not just a California problem. . . . This trend will spread out like tentacles." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing analysts say cities across the nation are struggling to meet housing demand while controlling sprawl. Anti-growth regulations and zoning limits are contributing to the housing shortage. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another key factor in California is Proposition 13. Approved by voters in 1978, it limits annual taxes to 1% of a property's value in 1975 or the most recent resale value, plus small increases for inflation. The law was designed to protect homeowners from high taxes when property values soar. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proposition 13 does not encourage cities and towns to approve more residential housing. They're more interested in commercial development that will create jobs and generate income tax revenue. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dowell Myers, a housing demographer at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, says "local observers tremble at the thought of what is going to happen to housing prices . . . when California's political and fiscal troubles begin to stabilize."  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Sales of existing homes soar 5.5% in August </span>
</div><div class="author">Sandra Block </div><div>443 words</div><div>26 September 2003</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.03</div><div>English</div><div>© 2003 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market surpassed expectations in August, and declining mortgage rates could fuel strong sales for the rest of the year, economists say. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing single-family homes rose 5.5% in August to a seasonally adjusted 6.47 million, eviscerating July's record of 6.13 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. In a separate report, the government said sales of new homes rose 3.4% to a seasonally adjusted 1.15 million, the second-highest rate on record. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, long-term mortgage rates slipped below 6% last week, assuaging fears that rising interest rates would stifle demand for homes. The average rate for a 30-year mortgage fell to 5.98%, down from 6.01% a week earlier and 5.99% a year ago, mortgage investor Freddie Mac said Thursday. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home sales probably peaked in August, economists aren't expecting a big drop-off any time soon. Existing home sales for September could top 6 million, says David Lereah, chief economist for the NAR. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contributing to the robust market: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Record low interest rates earlier this year. In June, long- term mortgage rates fell to 5.23%, an all-time low, prompting buyers of existing homes to negotiate contracts locking in those rates. Because home sales typically take 30 to 60 days to complete, many of those sales closed in August, pumping up the existing home sales numbers, says David Seiders, economist for the National Association of Home Builders. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Tight inventories. The number of new homes available for sale represents a 3.7-month supply, based on current sales, the lowest level in the last 40 years, according to the Census Bureau. Lean inventories stoke the housing market because they prevent the supply of homes from exceeding demand. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Stable monetary policy. The Federal Reserve Board signaled this week it doesn't plan to raise short-term rates this year, reassuring jittery bond investors, says Amy Crews Cutts, deputy chief economist for Freddie Mac. Interest rates on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell on the news, triggering the decline in mortgage rates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one potential pothole is housing prices, which continued to soar. The national median price for existing homes was $177,500 in August, up 9.8% from a year earlier, according to the NAR. In high- cost regions of the country, some buyers may be priced out of the market, Lereah says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rising home values can also stimulate sales. "We've had a real resurgence of the attitude toward homeownership as a great investment as well as a place to live," Seiders says.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high cost of housing is hitting close to home for many Americans, according to a survey to be released today. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two out of three Americans in major metropolitan areas worry that teachers, police officers and firefighters in their towns can't afford to live where they work. Half worry that their children and grandchildren won't be able to live near them. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poll, commissioned by the National Association of Realtors, shows that concern over affordable housing isn't limited to the poor and unemployed. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighty-two percent of those surveyed said they would support more affordable housing in their communities if the developments "fit with the area and were pleasant to look at." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sentiment could come as a surprise to planners and zoning officials who are often besieged by angry homeowners when they propose apartments and town houses near single-family homes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey results show that Americans are starting to see the social costs of escalating housing prices, says Cathy Whatley, a real estate agent from Jacksonville and president of the trade group. The survey is the association's first on affordable housing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People get it because they're beginning to see people they know, people they care about, have challenges when they go out in the housing market," she says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group is one of the nation's largest trade associations. It has 950,000 members who work in almost every community. For real estate agents who are in the business of selling, a bigger supply of affordable homes would mean more sales. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association is "trying to translate this out to their members and tell them that this is good business," says Steven Hornburg, a national housing strategist who helped design the survey. "They're getting in their members' faces and saying, 'Look, you really need to think about this.' " </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing costs are eating up a bigger share of household budgets, says Shekar Narasimhan, chairman of the Campaign for Affordable Housing, a non-profit advocacy group based in San Francisco. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing costs generally have taken a back seat to issues such as the economy, health care and education. But the survey shows that Americans now worry about housing as much as affordable health care and, in some metropolitan areas, more than unemployment. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The general rule of thumb for the last 40 years is that people can spend 30% on housing," he says. "Now, there are more than 1 million households paying more than 50% of their income on housing costs. It is becoming an issue for people making more than $50,000 a year." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people surveyed don't think government is doing a good job solving the affordable housing problem -- they gave elected officials a "C." But some communities are beginning to respond: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Cary, N.C., a suburb of booming Raleigh, permits "in-law" suites or "granny flats" above garages. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Virginia's Prince William County, a Washington suburb that had discouraged the construction of town houses in favor of expensive single-family homes, is considering building affordable housing for county employees. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* California voters approved $2.1 billion in bonds last year to help low- and moderate-income people rent apartments or buy their first homes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the San Francisco Bay Area, where housing prices are so exorbitant that many teachers and public safety workers must live two hours away, employers have been pushing for cheaper housing. The median price for a Bay Area home last month was $447,000, a new high. Half paid more and half paid less. The U.S. median price is $168,900. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a direct link between the economic prosperity of our county, region and state and whether or not people can afford to live here," says Shiloh Ballard, an associate director of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group. "Businesses recognize that link. If they're not able to recruit quality employees, that hurts the bottom line." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents are recognizing it, too. "If you want your schools to be quality schools with quality teachers, you need teachers to plant roots in that community," she says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those most likely to resist affordable housing are homeowners who fear it would lower their property values, says Robert Lang, director of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech. But studies have shown that cheaper units that are well designed and blend in with their surroundings don't affect values, he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lang points to the Old Town section of Alexandria, Va., where his office is. "There are million-dollar town houses, and you can turn a corner and be in subsidized housing," he says. "The presence of regular, middle-class people will not ruin house values." </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have been predicting wrongly for more than a year that the surge in home prices is about to moderate. The recent run-up in mortgage interest rates now gives everyone a reason to believe them. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a slowing market, home shoppers are at higher risk of buying at the top, taking on excessive monthly payments, and setting up for financial disaster when they go to sell for less than they paid. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have no surefire way to protect against paying a price today that will have them kicking themselves in a year or two. But in home buying, knowledge is power. And experts say a well-informed buyer can minimize the chance of diving into a frenzied market just ahead of a big crash. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence is growing that the housing market nationally has peaked. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is up by more than a full percentage point since June, and now stands at 6.44%. As a result, applications for purchase mortgages have softened. Industry forecasters generally agree that by the end of the year, the rate of sales will decline from its record, and home price growth, which has been running at 7%-plus, will slow by half. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the near future, price increases will stall, even decline, in some cities," economists Robert Shiller of Yale University and Karl Case of Wellesley College concluded in a report this week to the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. Most at risk, they say, are cities where home prices "have been frothy, notably cities on both coasts, and especially those cities that have weakening economies." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if your boss tells you that you're being transferred to suburban New York City -- which has been among the hottest markets in the country -- what do you do to reduce the possibility of overpaying for a house? </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Choosing an agent </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All real estate commissions come from the seller's proceeds when the sale is closed. So there's no good financial reason for a buyer not to sign on with an agent to guide the home search. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to making an offer on a house, a good agent should have two things you don't: The most current data from recent sales of comparable property through Realtor-controlled multiple listing services, and local knowledge. By going to work every day, a good agent develops a sense when a hot neighborhood is cooling. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Heagerty, general manager for eRealty in Austin, says buyers get better service when they work with a single agent rather than contacting different agents for each property on their shopping list. A written agreement between shopper and agent clarifies services that will be provided, she says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But be aware of your agent's potential conflicts. The same real estate brokerage may be representing both you and the seller. The brokerage's first allegiance is to the seller, who, after all, is paying everybody's commission. That can compromise the advice you get on deciding how much to bid. Such built-in conflicts have given rise to realty firms that take no property listings and instead represent buyers only. They're worth a look. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're dealing with an agent whose brokerage deals on both sides of the transaction, be careful. At the time you make an offer to buy, you're depending mainly on the integrity of your agent to make sure your interests are protected. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matters can get particularly difficult if you decide to make an offer on a house that your own agent has listed. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When that happens, Heagerty, whose firm represents both buyers and sellers, advises that an outside agent be brought into the deal. By having an outsider write and present your offer, your agent's conflict is minimized. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Find out about local markets </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In mid-2002, the median price for homes in Bergen and Passaic counties in New Jersey was growing at 24.7% annually. By mid-2003, annual price growth had slowed to 7.1%. It's a handy thing to know for a buyer coming into that suburban New York market. But who's the custodian of such information? </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, it's the National Association of Realtors, one of three key trackers of local market price trends. Here's what they tell you about local prices and how to find them on the Internet: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* NAR. NAR reports quarterly on changes in median prices -- the sales midpoint -- for more than 100 metro areas. The NAR data have weaknesses. Several big cities -- Detroit and Cleveland, for example -- don't report. And sometimes median prices shift because of the changing mix in the types of homes that are selling, not because prices are being bid up or down. Find the information at Realtor.org. Click "research," then "existing-home sales." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. The federal agency analyzes records of 23 million home sales over 28 years to plot average price changes in more than 300 markets. Among its weaknesses: It expresses average home price as an index value, not a dollar figure. And because its sale records are from mortgage investors Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the high end of local markets is excluded from the calculations. Find the House Price Index at www.ofheo.gov[http://www.ofheo.gov]. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Freddie Mac. Economists at Freddie Mac dip into the same data as OFHEO and produce slightly different results. Find the Conventional Mortgage Home Price Index at freddiemac.com. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Checking out the house </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you've decided to make an offer on a house, there are a variety of ways that you -- independent of your realty agent's recommendation -- can estimate its worth. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the more mind-boggling applications of computer technology is something called an automated valuation model -- AVM. They're a bit like the "blue book" for used cars, only for homes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AVMs crunch data from millions of electronic records on sales history and physical characteristics of specific houses, and of recent sales in a neighborhood. A good AVM with access to sufficient data can produce an amazingly accurate estimate of current value for a specific address. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because data for many properties are sketchy, AVMs express their degree of confidence -- high, medium or low -- for each estimate they spit out. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Free AVMs are available on the Internet, but the most reliable programs are marketed mainly to lenders and other real estate professionals. Subscription fees in many cases put them out of reach of one-time users like a home buyer. Ask your lender or realty agent to run a value check for you. Some of the good commercial-grade AVMs: Home Value Explorer, CASA, Home Price Analyzer or Home Value Calibrator. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reputable AVM priced for consumer use is ValueSure, the program developed by Santa Barbara, Calif.-based FNIS. For $10, you can buy an FNIS value estimate at LendingTree.com. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax records, which many counties make available online, can be a reliable guide to the relative values of property in a neighborhood, says Steven Kropper, founder of realty Web site Domania.com. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, when you're mulling an offer on a house, find five recent sales in the neighborhood. (Your realty agent, local newspaper listings or various Web sites, including Domania.com, can provide them.) Calculate the ratio of those recent sale prices to the properties' assessments for tax purposes. Then multiply the assessed value of the house you're bidding on by the ratio you've calculated for nearby houses. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Example: Five houses in the neighborhood sell for 1.2 times their assessed values. You're looking at a house with an assessed value of $200,000. Recent sales suggest a value of $240,000, or 1.2 times $200,000. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring expectations </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In polling conducted just before housing market crashes in the late 1980s and early 1990s, home buyers expressed inflated expectations for appreciating property values. Polling this year in selected markets found buyers' expectations continue to soar. A look at how buyers, on average, think their property value will grow annually over the next 10 years: </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jump in mortgage interest rates has jacked up costs for home buyers, but it hasn't punctured their spirit. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll shows 78% of American adults view this as a good time to buy a house. That's unchanged from a comparable poll in June, when interest rates were near their lowest point in about 45 years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public's view of investing in a home remains upbeat despite weeks of sharply rising mortgage interest rates. As housing bucks headwinds after a long, strong run, the steady sentiment suggests negative public psychology -- for now -- isn't among the market's problems. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reacting mainly to improving prospects for the U.S. economy, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage last week rose to 6.32%, according to mortgage investor Freddie Mac. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still low by historic standards, the rate is 1.11 percentage points higher than during the week ended June 20. The increase has snuffed out the boom in mortgage refinancing and has suppressed demand for home-purchase financing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Wilson, 42, a database administrator from Orlando, doesn't think the run-up in interest rates is too big a deal. "They've bumped up, but they're still low," Wilson says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allen Cruthirds, a mortgage lender from Dallas, rates this "a fabulous time to buy." Cruthirds says: "Why wouldn't people still go out and buy? They just missed out on the bottom of the market." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pam Gmelin, 27, of Port Jefferson, N.Y., is among the one-fifth of Americans who rate this as a bad time to buy a house. Gmelin and her husband, homeowners on Long Island, have abandoned for now plans to buy a bigger place for their young family. But it wasn't the interest rates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices have gone so incredibly high, you couldn't afford to buy a house around here," she says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing economists generally agree that the rise in interest rates is enough to slow sales and moderate price increases. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, says if the 30-year mortgage rate stays below 6.7% through the end of 2003, the drop in the home sale rate should be minor -- 5% or less. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's rate is still in a household's normal, expected range of low-cost financing," he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celia Chen, housing economist at Economy.com, says the positive view in the new poll may be based on different reasoning -- more people thinking it's a good time to buy before rates rise even higher. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, she says, higher interest rates will erode the favorable public view of home buying. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes sold at the second-fastest pace ever last month, but a decline from the June peak offers more evidence of a slowing national housing market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes sold in July at an annualized rate of 1.165 million, down 2.9% from a record 1.2 million in June, the government reported Tuesday. The report comes a day after the National Association of Realtors said existing homes sold at a 6.12 million annualized rate in July, the strongest month ever. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken together, the July housing reports are widely viewed as measuring a market at or just past its peak. Mortgage interest rates began a sharp rise in late June, and the negative effects aren't expected to show up in monthly sales reports for a few more months. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the interest rate spike probably pumped up July numbers, economists say, as procrastinating home shoppers were forced to act by the likelihood of higher financing costs to come. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising interest rates are pushing marginal buyers out of the market and that will be reflected in future sales reports, says Celia Chen, housing economist at Economy.com. "The party is over," she said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics says a recent decline in purchase mortgage applications portends a slowdown. "By autumn, housing will clearly be slowing," he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.28%, up 1.07 percentage points over a nine-week period, says mortgage investor Freddie Mac. Rates have risen as bond investors, who originate capital for home finance, adjust expectations to what appears to be an improving economy. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kent Conine, president of the National Association of Home Builders, said June "may have been the high-water mark" for new home sales. But he said demand remains high and inventories tight. Even with a sales drop-off in coming months, new homes sales may for the first time exceed 1 million in 2003, he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At current sales rates, the supply of available new homes for sale would last 3 1/2 months, the government says. That's slim by historical standards and serves as a prop for prices. The sales midpoint for new home prices in July was $191,500, up 9.1% from a year earlier.  </p>

</div><div class="author">Thomas A. Fogarty </div><div>1488 words</div><div>26 August 2003</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.01</div><div>English</div><div>© 2003 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales surged in July to a record, but economists increasingly are concerned that housing's decade-long bull market may be cresting. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing homes sold at an annualized rate of 6.12 million last month, eclipsing the previous record of 5.94 million in December and January, the National Association of Realtors reported Monday. Median price -- the sales midpoint -- skyrocketed to $182,100, up 12.1% from a year earlier and the largest jump since 1980. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But higher interest rates, an uncertain labor market, easy mortgage credit and the long period of hyperactivity have many alarmed about where the market may head. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the glitzy July numbers may be explained by "fence jumpers" -- procrastinating shoppers pushed to action by a sharp increase in interest rates since June, says NAR chief economist David Lereah. The better explanation, he says, is a fundamentally sound market fueled by a lean inventory of homes for sale and strong demand from a growing number of households. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are less certain. "Numbers for July represent kind of a last hurrah," says Ken Goldstein, economist at the New York-based Conference Board. He foresees a cooling market but says, "Unless someone can demonstrate investing in one's home is suddenly unattractive, housing is not going down for the count." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis is bleaker at money manager Bridgewater Associates. The firm last week told clients to expect a 10% decline in home sales and prices. Higher interest rates and surging prices are putting homes out of the reach of some buyers, the company says. According to Bridgewater, rising interest rates are already undermining housing. But damage won't be apparent in backward- looking monthly housing statistics for a few months. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caution ahead </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new NAR report is the latest in a series of indicators suggesting remarkable strength in the housing market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the government said the annualized rate of housing starts in July rose to 1.87 million units, the strongest number in 17 years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, NAR reported that all 126 local markets it tracks showed year-over-year increases during the April-June quarter. It's the first time that's happened since surveying began in 1982. In addition, nearly one-third of the metro areas experienced double-digit price growth, NAR said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those readings measure the market as it existed when mortgage rates were at or near 40-year lows. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forward-looking indicators show cause for concern. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes have fallen 15% over the last two weeks, says the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. And building permits for new homes dipped slightly last month, the Census Bureau reported. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, some of the markets where housing sizzled most are cooling. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Kropper, housing analyst and founder of realty Web site Domania, found that in shopping for his own house in suburban Boston, actual prices have dropped to about 98% of the seller's asking price. At the market's most frenzied, actual prices in the red-hot Boston area typically exceeded what the owner was asking by 3% or more. " 'Crazy' ended here nine months ago," he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere in Massachusetts, Worcester realty broker William Kelleher says average time on the market for a house has increased to 63 days from 57 days a year ago. Prices continue to rise on declining sales volume, he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The seller's reign has weakened slightly, but there's not been a dramatic shift in market conditions," says Kelleher. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's what's worrying analysts: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Interest rates. Since June, the average interest rate on a 30- year fixed-rate mortgage has jumped 1.07 percentage points to 6.28%, says mortgage investor Freddie Mac. Still low by historical standards, the latest interest rate spike is the sharpest over a nine-week period since spring 1994. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interest rate increase knocks some potential buyers out of the market and reins in the bidding of others. As a result, housing industry economists are lowering their expectations for the rate of price growth later this year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say damage to the housing market, if any, will depend on whether rates stall or continue higher. Economic consultant John Tuccillo of Arlington, Va., looks for another full-point rise. As a result, he says, "Housing will slow dramatically and stop dead in some markets." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Cagan, research director at First American Real Estate in Anaheim, Calif., sees only a slight impact from rising interest rates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Interest rates are still at historic lows -- just 25-year lows instead of 45-year lows," says Cagan. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And innovations by mortgage lenders give borrowers greater ability to minimize the impact of an interest rate spike through adjustable-rate mortgages and other new products. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen Davis, a sales manager from Novi, Mich., is buying a place near her current home. The availability of the right house on a quieter street prompted the decision to act despite rising interest rates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Davis says she was able to blunt the effect of rising rates by taking a mortgage that permits interest-only payments for the first five years. Her savings over a standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage: $675 a month. Some of that savings will go to monthly payments against the loan principal, even though the lender doesn't require it, Davis says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Forward buying. Thirty million homes have sold in the past five years, vs. 20 million in the five years ended in 1994. Total home sales have set records in nine of the past 11 years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conditions have been so conducive to home buying, says University of North Texas finance professor Randy Guttery, that buyers who prefer to wait buy now instead to head off higher costs in the future. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By "borrowing" against future sales, some analysts say that the housing market may be setting up for a sharper correction. Instead of pent-up demand, says Economy.com chief economist Mark Zandi, "We'll be having spent-up demand." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Jobs. The economy appears to be improving. In fact, that perception is forcing the rise in mortgage interest rates as bond investors, who supply the capital for home finance, adjust expectations. But against the backdrop of general growth, the economy continues to shed jobs. The 44,000 jobs lost in July marked the sixth consecutive month of declining employment. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Sklarz, chief valuation officer at Santa Barbara, Calif.- based FNIS, says continued softness in the labor market could undercut housing by diminishing consumer confidence. Says Sklarz: "Potential home buyers need to feel secure. The job market, rather than mortgage rates, may be the most important factor to watch." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Credit standards. Credit standards have eased over the past decade, as lenders permit smaller down payments and easier terms, such as interest-only monthly payments. And millions of homeowners have tapped into their growing home equity through second mortgages or by taking extra cash when refinancing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuccillo, the Virginia consultant, says years of homeowners supporting themselves "by looting the equity in their homes" puts many in financial peril. That, he and others say, could unleash a flood of market-depressing foreclosures. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Burns, an Anaheim consultant to home builders, says aggressive lending practices "are creating homeowners who can't afford to pay the mortgage." Damage, he says, is likely to be the worst in neighborhoods where highly leveraged buyers begin losing their homes to foreclosure. Even a slight decline in home values could prompt such a wave, he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zandi of Economy.com also sees a threat from changing credit standards but not the same one. Zandi says he is more concerned about the possibility of a severe constriction of lending requirements if home prices stall or decline. Severely restricted credit could lead to a downward spiral in home values, he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even now, Zandi says, lenders' concerns about inflated home prices have prompted a slight throttling back on mortgage credit. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market watchers don't have long to wait for new grist for analysis. The Census Bureau is scheduled this morning to release its report on the sale of new homes in July. July sales are expected to roughly match the record-high annualized 1.16 million pace of June, according to Thomson Financial.Cover storyCover story  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A USA TODAY analysis looked at areas that had lost housing that the U.S. Census describes as "seasonal" from 1990 to 2000. Seasonal or recreational homes can include anything from a hunting lodge in the mountains to a winter condo on Miami Beach. They are used occasionally or at certain times of the year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer than 10% of the nation's 116 million housing units were vacant in 2000 on April 1 -- Census Day. Of the vacant homes, 3.6 million were classified as seasonal. The greatest number of vacant units -- 3.8 million -- were categorized as homes for sale or rent. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis compared the share of housing the Census deemed seasonal in 1990 and 2000, and ranked spots by their percentage- point drop. In most cases, the seasonal share declined while housing numbers in general increased. That suggests a community's shift to more full-time residents, though other factors may be involved. Part- time residents may have changed their visiting season, or towns could have shifted boundaries.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in home prices would slow to below 4% later this year -- down from about a 7% annualized pace now -- if the housing market responds to the spike in mortgage rates as it has in the past. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is up a full percentage point since the end of June, to 6.24%. A USA TODAY analysis of housing finance data since 1979 shows that price growth slowed by an average of more than 40% following similar rate spikes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate industry economists have cut forecasts for growth as mortgage rates have jumped. Mortgage investor Freddie Mac, for example, now foresees an annualized growth rate for the October- December quarter of just 3.1%, revised from 4.4%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than a year, economists have predicted strong deceleration in home prices, but persistently low mortgage rates kept price growth strong. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rising rates will be the catalyst," says Lawrence Yun, forecast economist at the National Association of Realtors. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yun has cut his forecast for price growth. He now expects a 5.9% increase in median home prices this year; 4.2% next. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharply higher mortgage interest rates push some home shoppers out of the market and inhibit others from bidding up prices. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key findings in the USA TODAY analysis: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Not since 1987 have average rates jumped more than 1 percentage point in a quarter. If the current quarter ends on Sept. 30 with an average rate at or above the current 6.24%, this would be among the seven largest quarterly increases since 1979. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The effect on home prices can be dramatic. When rates leaped by a point or more, growth in home prices slowed by 44% on average in the following quarter. If prices are growing now by about 7%, as recent estimates suggest, that would mean a slowing to 3.9%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* In the 1990s, less dramatic interest rate increases had a smaller effect on prices. Mortgage rates climbed between a half and three-quarters percentage point in six quarters during the '90s. The pace of growth slowed in only three of the following quarters. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last several years, home prices have been on a tear. Historically, economists expect home prices to rise just a point or two more than general inflation. Under that formula, prices should be growing at well under 4%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norm Miller, a real estate expert at the University of Cincinnati, says the interest rate increase will have the biggest impact in markets with the highest prices. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says higher rates are unlikely to force a widespread decline in prices. Homeowners typically respond to a thinner pool of shoppers by postponing a decision to sell, and waiting for the market to improve. "I expect a lot of markets are going to flatten," Miller says.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions of Americans are trekking to the beach this month, where they'll find cool ocean breezes and hot, hot home prices. Coastal housing markets are booming -- typically registering double-digit annual price increases as baby boomers and Gen Xers bid for their little piece of the coast. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Todd and Angela Rossi, both in their 30s, are among buyers near Daytona Beach, Fla., part of a three-year boom for the beach town, known best for stock cars and spring break. The Rossis, who live in central Florida, view the three-bedroom beach house as a weekend getaway and a solid investment. "Like most people, we don't have faith in the stock market anymore," says Todd Rossi, a trainer for auto dealership staffs. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local realty agent Greg Antonich describes "a constant flow" of customers. "Some of us longtime Realtors can't understand where all the money is coming from," he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a 30% increase in median sales prices this summer over last, Daytona Beach remains a so-called affordable market. Oceanfront condos start at about $200,000. But prices are up in more expensive markets, too. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten of the 20 real estate markets with the fastest price appreciation in the January-March quarter were on a coast, according to the latest data from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. San Diego, Cape Cod, Mass., and South Florida are among the leaders. Double-digit price growth is the norm for beach communities, while annual appreciation in the broader real estate market is running about 7%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage interest rates and a still-iffy economy are raising concern about possible cooling in the USA's hot housing market. Coastal markets, where price run-ups generally have been the fastest, could get dragged down too, some analysts say. "If you go into it now," economist Mark Zandi says of vacation homes, "you're probably going in at the top of the market." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Carolina's Outer Banks region is on a tear. The average selling price for a home is $457,000, up a staggering 78% from 2000. The average sales price in June was up 19% from a year earlier. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oceanfront lots that 10 years ago would fetch $250,000 now go for three to four times that, says real estate agent Rick Drumm. Census data indicate vacation units in the Outer Banks more than doubled during the 1990s. Developers are tearing down older units to build grander homes that will generate more rent for owners. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Whitman, 45, an engineer from Albany, N.Y., is among those who have tied their fortunes to Outer Banks real estate. For the past 15 years, Whitman and his wife have vacationed in the Outer Banks, most of that time as renters. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after a succession of deals over the last three years, Whitman is buying his eighth Nags Head area property and selling his sixth. Rapid appreciation has allowed acquisition of the next more expensive property. It started with his purchase of a single home that was four lots from the Atlantic Ocean for $350,000. With the completion of his planned deals, Whitman will own two $1-million- plus oceanfront homes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rent collections as high as $6,000 a week have exceeded mortgage payments on each property, Whitman says. He says he's completed the deals with nearly perfect tax efficiency. With the exception of one sale from which he paid taxes on a capital gain, he's exploited the IRS rule permitting real estate investors to defer taxes by immediately committing gains to acquisition of the next property. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whitman, an experienced real estate investor in Albany, calls his Outer Banks deals a hobby that has built wealth while giving his family a place to escape for a few weeks every year. "To me, it's like found money; it's like the boom times in the stock market," he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drumm, the real estate agent, says Whitman's experience with positive cash flow from rents isn't typical. Drumm advises clients to expect that rent will only partially cover costs. Rental income is important to about 80% of his clients, Drumm estimates. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drumm says he expects Outer Banks prices to continue to rise, largely because other Atlantic beach areas continue to be more expensive. But sustainability of prices, he acknowledges, "is the million-dollar question." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald Jud, finance professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, sees threats beyond rising mortgage interest rates that could puncture Outer Banks home values. Among them: a hurricane that trashes buildings and accelerates beach erosion, a government decision to stop subsidizing flood insurance, or a reversal in the recent flow of capital from stocks to real estate. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Says Jud: "I'm advising people not to buy there now." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Basnight, 55, agrees. A native North Carolinian, Basnight recently cashed in his stake in the Outer Banks. He's watched the region develop from a sleepy rural backwater to a vacationland phenomenon. Until recently, he and his wife, Jane, owned a vacant lot there where they planned to build a second home. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Persuaded by a real estate investor offering top dollar, the Basnights, who live 200 miles away in central North Carolina, sold their lot. The 0.8 acre lot fetched nearly $600,000, or 65% more than they bought it for four years ago. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basnight says his enthusiasm for the Outer Banks has been tempered by overdevelopment. And, he says, property prices have soared to irrational heights. "In 18 months to two years, there's going to be a huge correction," says Basnight, who runs a playground equipment distributorship. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local conditions drive real estate markets, so not all beach towns are seeing double-digit price growth. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In South Carolina, exclusive Hilton Head Island saw 27% growth in median sales prices in the April-June quarter from a year earlier. Meanwhile, middle-class getaway Myrtle Beach saw its median sales price increase just 1.4%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Hilton Head, as with many exclusive communities, big price increases are built on flat or declining sales volume -- a sign that few owners want to sell. In the Hamptons area of Long Island, N.Y., "We just don't have enough homes to sell -- it's a constant battle," says realty agent Bill Carroll. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy area or not, strong price growth near the coasts is certainly the norm. The median selling price in the two-county market comprising the New Jersey shore surged 23.4% in the January- March quarter from a year earlier. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zudi Karagjozi, whose Kara Homes builds high-end homes, says the market should stay strong partly because investors are more intent on staying diversified. "Real estate is back in vogue; people have confidence in it again," he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for coastal properties in California are up smartly, too. But John Karevoll at realty tracker DataQuick estimates they're appreciating only at half the 17% rate for homes statewide. But that's because beach home prices are years into their growth cycle and prices already are $1 million and up. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike along the East and Gulf coasts, where larger scale development is still possible, coastal building in California now is lot-by-lot, frequently where a home has been torn down. And, Karevoll says, only the very wealthy use the property just for vacation. "It's just too expensive to buy that stuff and use it only as a second home," he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's ahead </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com, says he's concerned that the broad housing market is losing steam. Lenders are tightening standards. The three-year flow of money from stocks to real estate has flattened. As a result, the housing market is vulnerable even to small upticks in interest rates. Zandi says the vacation market won't be immune, and markets that have experienced price speculation may be particularly vulnerable. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some beach areas, analysts are seeing a pause in frantic price growth. Woody Hanson, a veteran appraiser from Fort Myers, Fla., says prices in several neighborhoods seem to have topped. Hanson says buyers are beginning to balk at asking prices, and softness in the economy is taking its toll. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many in the real estate industry -- and some outsiders -- argue that prices in beach markets are poised to rise strongly for many years to come. Clark Thompson, CEO at Internet realty firm EscapeHomes.com, argues that older boomers are driving up prices as they look for homes for their retirement. The 78 million Americans ages 39 to 57 will bid up prices for years, he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further forcing up prices, analysts say, are growing governmental restrictions on beach development resulting from environmental concerns and local anti-growth movements. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such arguments find unlikely support from John Talbott, a former Wall Streeter who recently wrote a book called The Coming Crash in the Housing Market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talbott, who says loose credit and inflated prices have set up the broad housing market for a correction of 20%-plus, says beach communities are likely to be somewhat insulated. "Florida, specifically, has been tremendously undervalued," Talbott says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida condo shopper Bill King, 48, an appraiser from Seattle, says he's not concerned about a downturn in prices. For the past year, he's been looking in the Venice area to give family members a place to hang their hats when visiting nearby parents. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">King says home values in beach towns like Venice tend to be resilient. Many buyers bring wealth acquired elsewhere, so the local job market is less of a factor. And because cash deals are more common, rising mortgage interest rates have less impact. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither is Whitman, the Outer Banks investor, concerned about being left out to dry by a big price drop. His two oceanfront houses will be mortgaged at just 60% of current value. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more to the point, Whitman says, "They aren't making any more beach, but they are making a whole lot more people who want to live on the beach." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacation home factors </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacation property is a small but important segment of the housing market, typically comprising less than 5% of sales. In some ways the vacation market is more vulnerable to price swings, and in some ways less: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Necessity vs. discretion. Necessity drives the broader housing market. With vacation homes, neither side of the deal is normally under pressure to act. Potential beach buyers can decide to rent for another year of vacation if they don't find a bargain. Sellers can usually wait for their price. "It's a fickle market; people make decisions based on emotion and passion," says Clark Thompson, CEO of Internet realty firm EscapeHomes.com. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Cash deals. Research by the National Association of Realtors in 2002 suggests that the vacation market is less dependent on mortgage financing, and therefore more insulated from interest rate increases. Just 52% of vacation home sales involve a mortgage, vs. 94% of the housing market generally. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Older, wealthier buyers. The typical vacation home buyer is age 61, vs. 51 for home buyers generally. Household income for vacation home buyers averages $76,900, or 80% higher than for the typical American household. Most buyers of vacation homes don't plan to rent them, NAR research says.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors fleeing to the perceived safety of real estate are flipping the second-home market upside down. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey by the National Association of Realtors, taken last winter and being released today, suggests rental houses in the city are hot. Beach vacation condos and getaway cabins in the mountains are not. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR survey found that 66% of residences purchased as second homes during the January-March quarter were located in cities or suburbs, a market share vastly greater than the 16% of second homes normally found in those locations. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the same quarter, property purchased in resort or recreational areas accounted for 12% of second home purchases, vs. the 56% of the second-home market normally found there. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further evidence of a surge in investment-motivated purchasing: The median price for second homes was $150,000, a relatively low figure suggesting sales were dominated by city rentals rather than high-priced vacation properties. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR spokesman Walter Molony says some of the surge in home buying for investments might be seasonal. Not until now has NAR studied the second-home buying patterns during a single quarter. At the same time, Molony says, the finding builds on earlier NAR research charting growing interest in realty investment since the bear market for stocks began in 2000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An NAR study last year of the second-home market found that 37% of buyers said they were motivated mainly by investment, up from 20% in 1999. Home values have grown consistently in almost every metro market, NAR data show. Nationally, the median sales price grew 7.0% in 2002, while some of the strongest markets -- suburban New York City and areas of Southern California, for example -- saw price growth of 20% or more. Most broad stock indexes have gained in recent months but remain far below their peaks of 2000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Raddatz, a certified financial planner in Clearwater, Fla., calls the move to investment real estate "an ominous trend." Raddatz says speculation has driven home prices up too far and too fast in many cities. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Sklarz, chief valuation officer at real estate tracker FNIS in Santa Barbara, Calif., says a typical urban condo can be expected to yield about 6% in rental income regardless of future changes in market value. "These days, that's a darn good rate" of return, says Sklarz. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sklarz says second-home purchases almost always involve an investment element, even when they're purchased for part-time personal use. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors' trauma in the stock market in recent years has made investment more of a factor," he says.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent bad news on mortgage rates, foreclosures and job losses won't push the USA's housing market from boom to bust anytime soon, five housing industry economists agreed Wednesday. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're looking at pretty flat in the second half (of 2003), and down only modestly next year," David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said in a conference call sponsored by industry group Homeownership Alliance. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie Mae chief economist David Berson said the market is likely to remain strong regardless of the direction of mortgage interest rates. Lower rates would keep homeownership affordable, he said. Higher rates would signal a strengthening economy, more personal income and more potential home buyers. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not only housing economists who are bullish. According to a recent USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll, 78% of Americans consider this a good time to buy a house, vs. 67% during the 1991 recession. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales, Seiders said, should set a record for 2003, despite an expected cooling in the second half. National Association of Realtors economist Lawrence Yun projected prices of existing homes rising 6.1% in 2003, vs. a 7.0% annual increase last year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bright forecasts come despite recent developments that could portend a housing slowdown: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Interest rates. The Mortgage Bankers Association of America said Wednesday that the average interest rate on 30-year fixed mortgages jumped to 5.37%, the third weekly increase in a row. The economists said rates are still near 45-year lows, and the 30-year rate is likely to stay below 6% through year's end. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Foreclosures. The Mortgage Bankers last month reported a record high 1.2% of mortgages in foreclosure in the January-March quarter. Freddie Mac chief economist Frank Nothaft said the number of distressed loans typically peaks about a year after an economic recovery begins. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Labor market. The Labor Department last week said unemployment in June jumped to 6.4%, the highest in nine years. Economists say the labor market is likely to improve with an ongoing economic recovery. </p>

</div><div class="author">Jim Hopkins </div><div>515 words</div><div>9 April 2003</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.02</div><div>English</div><div>© 2003 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.
 </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Signs are growing that Silicon Valley's housing boom may be ending its sizzling run amid the Internet bust and technology slump. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes sold in February skidded 33.5% from a year ago in Santa Clara County -- the fourth consecutive month of declining sales in the heart of Silicon Valley. Nationally, volume rose 1.2% during the month. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices, still the USA's highest, also are getting squeezed. February's median was $535,000 -- up 1.9% from a year ago vs. an 8.2% rise in the U.S. median, $161,600. The area's increase was the smallest since after the Sept. 11 attacks, when prices fell before rebounding. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact is likely to be felt well beyond tech-focused Silicon Valley. Many valley entrepreneurs finance start-ups, and the innovations they produce, with home-equity loans, says Andrew Leigh, a researcher at Harvard University. If home prices stagnate, entrepreneurs cannot raise as much for their start-ups. Fewer may blossom or survive to the point where employees are needed, Leigh says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The valley's real estate strength has held up despite huge job losses. Santa Clara County, home to tech giants such as Hewlett- Packard, Intel and Cisco Systems, has lost 16% of its jobs since employment peaked at more than 1 million at the end of 2000. The jobless rate soared to 8.5% in February from 1.3% in December 2000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet median home prices, driven partly by low interest rates, hit a record $578,000 last May. Recently, they've been sliding because of: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* More supply. There are about 3,600 homes for sale in Santa Clara County -- double the number a year ago, Creekside Realty says. Three years ago, when prices were "on fire," there were just 915 homes for sale, says Creekside owner Richard Calhoun. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Fears. Some would-be buyers are on the sidelines because they worry prices are too lofty or may fall in the county and the broader San Francisco Bay Area, real estate experts say. "Sticker shock is a huge, huge issue," says John Karevoll at researcher DataQuick. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jill Lublin, 41, a publicist in Novato near San Francisco, gave up a yearlong hunt for a single-family home as an investment. She's now looking north, near Sacramento, where prices are lower. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Economic woes. Job losses continue to pile up in the valley. Since May, area companies have shed 25,600 jobs. "And the layoffs are continuing," says Stephen Levy, head of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calhoun says April's figures could be even weaker, showing a year- over-year decline -- the first since the months after Sept. 11. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales volume throughout the seven-county Bay Area was down 22% in February compared with a year ago. The median price rose 4.3% -- the fourth consecutive month of lower annual growth.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes surged in December, bringing a record- setting 2002 to a torrid end. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, 5.563 million existing homes changed ownership, 5% more than the sales record set in 2001, the National Association of Realtors reported Monday. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December alone, existing homes sold at an annualized pace of 5.86 million -- up 5.2% from November. It was the third-strongest monthly number in the 35 years NAR has tracked sales volume nationally. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are up, too. The sales midpoint for the year -- $158,300 - - rose 7.1% from 2001. That's the strongest annual increase since 1980, when hyperinflation helped drive home prices up 11.7%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the surge suggests that rock-bottom mortgage rates have trumped flagging consumer confidence and a sluggish economy. Interest rates, at about 6% for a 30-year mortgage, are as low as they've been in 40 years, experts say. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, NAR chief economist, said first-time and move-up buyers are driving the market. Most analysts say sales are likely to cool as more Americans get into homes they've been seeking and interest rates tick up. The Census Bureau on Monday reported the USA's highest homeownership rate ever in the October-December quarter: 68.3% </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lereah projects sales this year of 5.34 million, which would be the second-strongest year on record. Celia Chen, housing economist at Economy.com, sees a tapering off rather than a crash. Prices should continue to increase, she says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government said last week that housing starts jumped to a 1.835 million annual rate in December, the highest in 16 years. The government today is scheduled to report new home sales for December. The November total of 1.07 million was a record.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned homes jumped to their highest level in six months in October, the National Association of Realtors said Monday in a report that suggests housing, a driving force for economic growth, remains strong. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boosted by extremely low interest rates, purchases of existing homes rose 6.1% to 5.77 million, on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, in October. That was up nearly 10% from October 2001 and was the highest since April, the NAR said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates for 30-year fixed mortgages were below 6.5% from July through October, the lowest in at least 31 years. Rates have dipped more this month. Last week, the average 30-year rate was 6.03%. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The strength in home sales is encouraging," Economy.com housing analyst Celia Chen says. "Housing will hold up long enough for other drivers of economic activity to kick in." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the economy appeared to have slowed abruptly and consumer confidence tumbled in October, last month's sales reflect closings of contracts that likely were drawn up in earlier months. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only do home sales directly contribute to economic activity, but housing purchases also lead to increases in consumer spending as homeowners spruce up their new residences with new furniture, appliances and decorations. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In more good news for the soft economy, the NAR said the median price of previously owned homes hit $159,600 in October, up 10% from a year ago. Increases in home values not only give sellers a bigger profit, they also increase household net worth, a trend that is believed to boost spending. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The continued rise in home prices may inspire consumers to spend during the forthcoming Christmas period, stimulating the economy and driving economic growth in the New Year," says Matthew Ellis, an economist with Wachovia in Charlotte. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the sharp gains, most economists dismiss fears of a housing bubble in the USA, which would precede a large decline in prices, much like the stock market fall that began in early 2000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-sector economists do expect, however, that the housing market will soften slightly next year but will remain strong, just down from elevated levels.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Builders broke ground on homes at the fastest pace in 16 years last month, but other data Thursday showed a weak job market and declining manufacturing output, suggesting the U.S. economy is still struggling. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, most private-sector economists say they expect the U.S. recovery will continue. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 13.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.8 million in September, the highest level since mid-1986, as consumers took advantage of low mortgage rates and put their money into the housing market instead of the stock market, the Commerce Department said. The gain followed three consecutive months of drops. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you see an indicator rise this much, you have to step back and catch your breath," says Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Naroff and other economists warned it's unlikely the USA will continue to see such "astronomical" housing gains much longer. Many private economists expect housing activity will soon level off to a more subdued, but healthy, pace. That means housing won't be a major contributor to economic growth, as it has been during the past two years, but won't sink so as to spark painful price drops either. "Housing has peaked out," says Donald Straszheim, president of Straszheim Global Advisors, an economic research firm in Santa Monica, Calif. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates stayed historically low this week but were substantially higher from earlier this month. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage this week was 6.15%, up from a record low of 5.98% last week and the highest in a month. If the upward trend continues, the incentive to buy a home or refinance could soften. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other news, the Labor Department said the number of people applying for first-time jobless benefits rose 6% to a seasonally adjusted 411,000 last week, a level that suggests layoffs are continuing. Case in point: Computer maker Sun Microsystems Thursday said that it planned to cut more than 4,000 jobs, or 11% of its workforce, worldwide. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 3.8 million Americans were continuing to receive jobless benefits in the week ended Oct. 5, the week of most recent data. That's the highest level since May. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After looking better at the start of the summer, the apparent renewed weakness in the labor market is not a good sign for consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity and, along with housing, has kept the economy afloat for more than a year. Consumers who are unemployed or are worried about losing their jobs are more likely to hang on to their cash rather than spend. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports on manufacturing were downbeat. The Federal Reserve said its index of factory production fell 0.3% in September after decreasing 0.2% in August -- the first back-to-back declines since the end of last year. The Philadelphia Fed, meanwhile, said its index of factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region fell to a minus- 13.1, the lowest level since November. Negative numbers point to a drop in activity.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Shattered confidence and skyrocketing unemployment after the
Sept. 11 attacks should have snuffed out the housing boom. Last
October, even the normally ebullient National Association of
Realtors (NAR) cited that as the likely outcome.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Instead, the housing market snapped back, and 2001 saw record
sales for both new and existing homes. NAR chief economist David
Lereah predicts that the boom, now in its seventh year, has
sufficient steam to establish sales records again this year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan credits the strong
housing market with cushioning the economic downturn. Rising home
prices have offset stock market losses and provided homeowners with
the confidence and cash to continue spending, he says. Last month
before Congress, Greenspan cited reasons for the continuing
strength: low interest rates, a shortage of land suitable for home
building and strong increases in newly formed households fueled
partly by immigration.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The average 6.22% interest rate reported last week by Freddie Mac
for the 30-year mortgage is the lowest in 32 years of record
keeping. The Fed's acknowledgement of weakness in the economy is
likely to keep mortgage rates near record lows for the rest of the
year, says Freddie Mac chief economist Frank Nothaft.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some analysts worry that prices in some local markets are rising
too fast. An NAR report last week noted that the national median
price rose at an annual rate of 7.4% in the April-June quarter,
faster than the historical norm of a point or two ahead of
inflation, which is now below 2%.
</p>
<p>Health of the economy; After attacks; rebound has been spotty; The U.S. economy rebounded more quickly than analysts expected after the Sept. 11 terror attacks. But while sectors such as housing barely paused; the airlines and other battered industries slumped even deeper. Almost a year later; the recovery is shaky; hampered by a volatile stock market and anxieties about terrorism; corporate scandals and a war with Iraq. Says Brian Wesbury; chief economist for Griffin Kubik Stephens &amp; Thompson: The fear level is definitely higher than I have seen in a long; long time."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Disappointing new data suggest the economy might not be rebounding as solidly as economists had hoped, as a key gauge of factory orders fell sharply in June, while sales of existing homes plunged unexpectedly. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think this is necessarily time to run for the bomb shelter, but it does suggest things have slowed down," says David Wyss, chief economist for Standard &amp; Poor's. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some decidedly positive news, however, the line of newly jobless workers waiting to collect first-time unemployment benefits got shorter last week, a sign that the battered jobs market might be firming. And sales of new homes roared to a record in June. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As has been the case for months, the numbers drew a contradictory picture of an economy that can't quite seem to accelerate into a robust recovery, but doesn't yet appear to be in serious danger of falling back into recession, despite historic losses in the stock market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Basically it's pushing out the recovery over a longer time horizon," says Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Wells Fargo. "It might be at best a modest or anemic recovery, at least this year." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details on Thursday's numbers: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Orders for long-lived "durable goods," from jet aircraft to computer chips, slid an unexpected 3.8% in June, according to the Commerce Department, a hint that the factory rebound might not be as strong as other data have suggested. On the other hand, this is a notoriously volatile number, and analysts will watch to see if there's a rebound in July. A worrisome subset of the data showed an apparent retreat in business investment. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Sales of existing homes plunged 11.7% to a rate of 5.07 million homes a year in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, raising concern that a pillar of the economy might be weakening. But analysts note that sales are still historically high, and booming mortgage applications point to a comeback in July. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Sales of new homes rose 0.5% to a rate of 1.001 million a year, the Commerce Department reported, a record. Though new home volume is only a fifth of existing home sales, this is evidence the housing market remains hot. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* First-time unemployment claims reported by the Labor Department fell a better-than-expected 21,000 to 362,000 last week, the lowest in 17 months. That brought the less-volatile four-week average down to 385,000, the lowest in 16 months. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Obviously the economic news is not great," says William Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Financial Services. "But it seems to me that putting it all together, it's pointing upwards rather than downwards."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the U.S. economic recovery has hit a soft spot, home builders and home buyers aren't part of it: Housing starts shot up 11.6% in May to an annual rate of 1.73 million, according to Commerce Department figures released Tuesday. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the biggest monthly gain in almost seven years and the fifth-highest reading in the past 15 years -- a strong sign that the housing boom that moderated last year's recession is fueling the recovery and a signal that consumers are still in a spending mood, despite a dip in retail sales in May. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Last year, home builders were cautious with construction plans because of the recession. This year, they are scrambling to keep pace," says Steven Wood, chief economist at FinancialOxygen. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, figures Labor Department figures show that consumer inflation is tame. Though health care and housing prices rose, the prices of energy, food, transportation and clothing fell, producing no change in the headline inflation number in May. Over the past year, inflation is a benign 1.2%, below the average 2.5% of the past 10 years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Inflation is a non-issue," says Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That should help keep the Federal Reserve on hold when policymakers meet next week to discuss what to do with their benchmark short-term interest rate, now at a 40-year low of 1.75%. With inflation quiet and the recovery slower than officials would like, the Fed is unlikely to raise rates at its meeting June 25-26. Some analysts think policymakers might wait until early next year to begin taking back some of the aggressive rate cuts they made last year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May's jump in housing starts is evidence the Fed's action last year is still having an effect. Low mortgage rates, which fell in anticipation of the Fed moves and have lately stayed near 30-year lows, have sparked a wave of home buying that shows no sign of letting up. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, home builders pushed single-family starts up 9.6% in May to an annual rate of 1.39 million. For the first five months of this year, the rate was 1.35 million, the highest since 1978.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Americans snatched up homes at a dizzying pace in April, but their incomes and spending barely rose, according to reports released Tuesday that suggest the economic recovery is on track but is not moving at the swift pace some had hoped. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector, however, continued to be the exception. Sales of previously owned homes jumped 7% to 5.8 million units on a seasonally adjusted annual basis in April, the National Association of Realtors said. That's the third-highest sales level on record. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incomes, however, nudged just 0.3% higher in April, while consumer spending rose a disappointing 0.2% -- adjusted for inflation -- after being flat in March, the Commerce Department reported. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say that suggests consumer spending is rising at about a 2.5% annual rate this quarter after increasing 3.2% in the first quarter and 6.1% in the last three months of 2001. Many analysts, who closely watch consumer spending because it accounts for two- thirds of U.S. economic activity, said Tuesday that they might lower their second-quarter gross domestic product forecast following the spending data. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The numbers for April suggest a little softening," Credit Suisse First Boston economist Jay Feldman says. "It's probably just some loss of momentum after an unsustainably strong fourth and first quarters." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spending data, along with a report showing only a small gain in consumer confidence in May, dampened investors' spirits on Tuesday. U.S. stock markets fell, and the dollar faced downward pressure. The euro ended the day at 92.91 cents against the dollar, its strongest level since September. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But analysts say the worries are unnecessary. Consumer spending is still growing at a healthy, albeit slower, pace that will boost the economy, they say. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumer spending is solid," says Charles Lieberman, chief economist at Advisors Financial Center. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the strong housing market bodes well for future consumer spending. Home buyers typically purchase appliances, furniture and other goods to spruce up their new homes. And those who are selling their homes are likely making a decent profit, giving them money to spend. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of homes sold in April in the USA was $153,300, up 7.1% from a year earlier. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence gauge rose to 109.8 in May from 108.5 in April. The gain was smaller than expected, and the report was mixed. While consumers' views on current conditions improved, their expectations for the economy six months out deteriorated.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. -- Sandra Jimenez struggled for years as a single mother of four in the ranks of the working poor. Her children grew from tots to teenagers living in shabby apartments. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, Sandra and her new husband, Daniel, both 34, and the four children will move into their own five-bedroom home with petunias lining the front porch. The couple never dreamed that on their income -- she is a receptionist, and he is a construction worker -- they could buy a place big enough for each child to have a separate bedroom. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel sums up their sentiment: "I feel like a millionaire." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jimenez family is one of many across the USA that are benefiting from state and federal programs designed to tackle inner- city blight while increasing home ownership among low- and moderate- income families. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the programs, cities purchase substandard, foreclosed homes in designated redevelopment areas at 30% of their appraised value from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The cities renovate the homes and resell them, passing the savings along to families -- generally people who make less than 80% of the area's median income. Here, that's about $38,000 a year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Bernardino, which has budgeted about $1 million a year to boost home ownership with down payment assistance, has expanded the program so more families can qualify. It has raised the income limits to 120% of the area median income, or $56,900. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jimenez family put $500 down, and got a loan from the city for the rest of the down payment. If they leave the house before they've lived in it for 10 years, they'll owe that money to the city. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another HUD program is aimed at making the process even more affordable. The agency will sell thousands of homes to cities nationwide for the price of $1 each. The program is operating in cities large and small, from Auburn, Maine, to Roswell, N.M. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's a catch. The properties have all been on the market for at least six months at steeply discounted prices and haven't sold. Generally, that means the places aren't worth much. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HUD official Mathew Franklin calls the $1 price tag "an aggressive discount." Even at $1, HUD calculates it will save money. It costs the agency $66 a day for taxes, repair and maintenance of the houses, which HUD gets as a result of foreclosures. As of March this year, there were about 3,000 foreclosed HUD homes that had been on the market more than six months. That translates to roughly $198,000 a day. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although cities are not under any obligation to take any of the houses offered, many of them are willing. "Anytime you can get real estate for $1, there's some use you can make of it," says Maggie Pacheco, San Bernardino's director of community development. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Variations </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many ways of paying for the programs. Often, as in San Bernardino, cities look to private enterprise for help. Instead of purchasing the houses outright, the city lets nine private construction companies buy them at the city's discounted price. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The companies remodel to city standards and sell to buyers who meet income standards. The upgraded houses go on the market for about 30% less than a house of similar size and quality in the same neighborhood. New owners agree to maintain the house and repay the city for any loan assistance if they sell it before 10 years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're taking old, dilapidated housing, reconstructing it and putting in families that have never before owned a house," Pacheco says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The city of Baltimore has 17 home-buying incentive programs and is trying to cope with 12,000 vacant and abandoned units, says Tom Jaudon, chief of the city's Home Ownership Institute. Jaudon plans to snap up 31 of the $1 houses from HUD and turn them over to non- profit organizations for rehabilitation and resale. Getting owners into the houses, he says, "will help the goal of stabilizing neighborhoods." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* In Columbus, Ohio, which got the first $1 house because the program was partly the brainchild of the Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, there are plans to sell the house for $1 in a raffle open to anyone whose income meets the HUD income requirements. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Columbus Mayor Michael Coleman says he'll incorporate other houses into his "Welcome Home Columbus" program, a campaign to bring people back into the core of the city. "In my view, home ownership is the key element to revitalizing neighborhoods," he says. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Filling vacant houses </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what the city of San Bernardino, population 180,000, is banking on. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacant and abandoned houses are the bane of San Bernardino. Pacheco estimates that 20% of the city's 59,000 houses are empty. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons are twofold. First, the California real estate market crashed about 10 years ago. Then in 1994, Norton Air Force Base closed and threw nearly 8,000 people out of work. Thousands of houses were no longer worth what their owners paid, so people let the banks foreclose. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacant houses are breeding grounds for crime, injury and disease. More often than not, they are vandalized and occupied by transients and drug dealers. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The beauty of the HUD program, Pacheco says, is that cities have options. They can renovate the houses for resale, turn them into day- care or community centers or tear down the houses and use the land for parks. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 50 years old, the house where the Jimenezes now live has storybook charm. In the children's rooms upstairs, ceilings are slanted along curving rooflines. There are window seats and doors that open into nooks and crannies of the attic eaves. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the couple first saw this house, it was crumbling. Marisela Labastida, whose construction company works with San Bernardino to reconstruct old housing, says the Jimenez project was typical. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her company updated the house with new insulation, wiring, kitchen cabinets, carpeting, copper plumbing and a sprinkler system. The Jimenezes got the house for $110,000; the five-bedroom house would otherwise have cost at least $165,000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house is in a neighborhood that's considered "marginal." But Sandra Jimenez says, "I think a neighborhood is what you make it. I plan on living here a long time. We'll make it a better neighborhood."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Despite economic prosperity, one out of 10 working families earning as much as $70,000 a year in some cities can't afford decent housing without spending more than half their income, according to a report out today. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because wages are not keeping up with skyrocketing housing prices and because there is not enough affordable housing being built, a growing number of moderate-income families face a housing crisis, says the report by The Center for Housing Policy. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even families who work and play by the rules don't have a decent place to live," says Michael Stegman, professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and lead author of the study. "Policymakers have to understand this is a very serious problem." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report by the non-profit research arm of the National Housing Conference, a housing affordability advocacy group, is the first to look at the housing problems of moderate-income working families instead of the poor and unemployed. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most analysis focuses on housing issues for very low-income families," says Margery Austin Turner, a housing expert at the Urban Institute. "This says that even if a family is working, they can't afford the basic element of a decent quality of life." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research focused on working families in 17 metropolitan areas that earn from the full-time minimum wage of $10,700 a year to 120% of the median income where they live (half of families earn more than the median income, half earn less). In the San Francisco area, for example, 120% of the annual median income is more than $70,000. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the most up-to-date numbers in 1997 showed that 3 million families, or about 10%, have critical housing needs. That's 17% more than in 1995. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stegman, a former official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, says recent anecdotal evidence of teachers and firefighters who can't afford to live in the communities they serve showed that the problem is only getting worse. "The market is catering to people who can afford more," he says. Anti-sprawl measures that restrict construction contribute to the problem. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government and private sector need to do more to help the working class, Stegman says. He suggests property tax breaks and subsidized mortgages, which now are available only to the very poor. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, which looked at renters and homeowners, shows: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* 76% of the 3 million moderate-income families who are in a housing bind spend more than half of their incomes on housing; the rest live in substandard housing. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Slightly more than half of these families live in the suburbs; more than half own their homes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The supply of affordable housing is tight in some markets. In Boston, almost 31,000 families could afford to buy a $100,000- $125,000 home in 1998, but only 1,255 homes in that price range were available. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Problem affects millions </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cities, a growing percentage of moderate-income families can't afford decent housing unless they spend more than half of their incomes. 'Moderate' income can be as little as the full-time minimum wage, $10,700 a year, to as much as 120% of the median income in each metro area. That's more than $70,000 in the San Francisco Bay Area. Half of families earn more than the median income, and half earn less. </p>
