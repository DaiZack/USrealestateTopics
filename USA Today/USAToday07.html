<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market in Jacksonville, N.C., is bucking the nationwide trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are not recession-proof, but we are recession-resilient," says Jim Reichardt, executive director of Jacksonville-Onslow (County) Economic Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area has a major asset: It's home to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station New River. As a result of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure program, the region gained about 12,000 military jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. The housing market benefits from the steady flow of Marines. On average, military home buyers only stay for three to five years, and real estate agents sell the same houses again and again, says Melissa Worrell, president-elect of Jacksonville Board of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, Jacksonville's home sales were 10.1% higher than the same month last year. Because of the military bases, the city has one of the youngest populations in the nation. For that reason, first-time home buyers account for the majority of sales, Worrell says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Only six homes sold in the past 12 months exceeded $500,000, Worrell says. But that doesn't mean prices have fallen. Jacksonville never saw a boom in new construction, and home foreclosures have not dragged down home values. In September, the median price was 10.3% higher than a year prior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Jacksonville's unemployment rate was 8.3% in September, less than the state's rate of 10.4%. Military personnel have a stable disposable income, which has helped local auto dealers, restaurants and retail stores, Reichardt says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. About 20 years ago, downtown Jacksonville seemed mostly a wild and wooly place filled with bars, says Dennis Burgard, former president of Bettering Our Local Downtown, a non-profit organization. That's mostly been cleared, and the non-profit is trying to revitalize the area along the banks of the New River, where walkways and waterfront access abound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacant properties are being used for new homes that are modeled after Victorian-style homes in downtown Charleston, S.C. Prices range from about $160,000 to $220,000. One developer has sold seven homes fairly quickly in the lower price range, Burgard says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median-price home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This home, built in 1997, is on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price: $158,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bedrooms: 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bathrooms: 2 full.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Size: 1,250 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Features: Open floor plan, family room, deck, attached garage, corner lot, near Camp Lejeune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernice Ruse is selling a two-story, colonial brick home in a gated community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price: $850,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bedrooms: 6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bathrooms: 4 full, 1 half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Size: 6,700 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Features: Elevator, foyer with a curved staircase and hardwood floors, butler's pantry, den, sunroom, family room, upstairs balcony, master suite with walk-in closets, handicapped-accessible bedroom downstairs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many second-home owners gravitate to mountains, golf courses and beaches, other passions motivate vacation-home buyers. Themed communities now are targeted at hunters and anglers, cyclists and equestrians, pilots and gardeners, even oenophiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Developments are becoming more specialized," says Orlando real estate broker Scott Kauffman of Golfcoursebusiness.com, an expert on master planned communities. "People have different passions."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at 3 types of themed communities:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Equestrian. With more than 3 million horses owned for recreation in the USA, there are communities with stables, trails, training and instructional facilities -- even polo fields. The most popular states for equine-loving home buyers are Florida, North and South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Texas, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. At Palmetto Bluff, S.C., houses run $1.2 million to $5 million, but there are more affordable options. Homes at Cold Mountain, N.C., start in the $200,000s (coldmountainlife.com) and in the $400,000 range at Glenmore, Va. (glenmore.com).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Aviation. There are more than 600,000 licensed pilots in the country, and aviation-centric communities offer the ultimate convenience: an airport, with runways and oversized "garages" for planes. The 1,300-acre Mountain Air outside Asheville, N.C., is one of the best-known: It has condos, villas, cabins and houses from $250,000 to more than $2 million (mountainaircc.com).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Fishing. Communities catering to fly-fishing devotees can be found nationwide, especially in the Rocky Mountain states and Pacific Northwest. Bass and other lake fishing is popular, particularly on the larger lakes of Texas and Minnesota. South Florida, the Bahamas and the Caribbean attract buyers for tarpon and bonefishing. Other fishing hot spots include Mexico and Hawaii.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing fortunes of Gary, Ind., may depend on the demolition of abandoned homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., asked for $24.7 million in federal funding to demolish boarded-up homes that still dot some neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though no homes have been torn down because the funding has not yet been received, the hope is that removing the dilapidated structures will lead to urban renewal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary, in Lake County, borders Lake Michigan and remains a blue- collar, steel industry town. The county includes two other urban manufacturing areas, as well as towns that are becoming suburbs of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In September, county home sales were 18.6% lower than in the same month in 2008, though the modest housing market escaped the boom and bust seen nationally. Home sales started to fall only last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession was one cause, because local steel mills were hurt by the auto industry, says Brenda Miley, president of the Greater Northwest Indiana Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Because Lake County was not overbuilt like many other parts of the country, it did not see home prices plummet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are even starting to improve: September's median price is 2.1% higher than a year prior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Gary's unemployment rate was up to 9.1% in September, slightly better than the state and national averages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The county has done fairly well economically through the recession, says Michael Hicks, economics professor at Ball State University. In part, that is because its income and sales taxes are much lower than in the nearby areas of Michigan and Illinois.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indiana also has a budget surplus, he says. All of that attracts businesses and residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Up-and-comer. In Lake County, St. John has gotten much attention as a family-friendly, well-planned community that features many bicycle and pedestrian trails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, it was ranked 48th among the 100 best places to live in the nation, according to Money/CNN.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Gary is about 24 miles southeast of Chicago, many workers there are starting to buy more affordable homes in suburbs such as St. John, Hicks says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob and Betsy Schleyer are selling a three-story home built in 2002 that has a private pathway to Lake Michigan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price: $996,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bedrooms: 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bathrooms: 4 full baths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Size: 3,800 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Features: Den, game room, family room, laundry room, sauna/ steam room, two fireplaces, master suite with private deck, screen porch, patio and outdoor shower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median-price home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This ranch home, built in 1960, is on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price: $115,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bedrooms: 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bathrooms: 1 full bath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Size: 1,920 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Features: Game room, wet bar, wood-burning stove, dining room, detached garage, fenced yard and storage shed.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Manufacturing, home sales show gains ; Also exceeding hopes: Construction spending</span>
</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson; Stephanie Armour   </div><div>452 words</div><div>3 November 2009</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2009 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bevy of reports on Monday attested to a recovering economy, with manufacturing activity, pending home sales and construction spending all exceeding expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some readings were juiced by one-time sparks, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 77 points to 9789. The reports come as the Federal Reserve today begins a two-day meeting on interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing sector grew for the third-consecutive month in October and at the fastest pace since April 2006. The index of factory activity was 55.7, up from 52.6 in September, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said. Above 50 indicates expansion; below means contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most encouraging: A measure of factory employment signaled growth for the first time in 14 months. It's unlikely factories are adding jobs after cutting 2 million since the recession began in December 2007, says Norbert Ore, who oversees the ISM survey. But the rate of decline is likely "slowing significantly," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving the rebound is a production ramp-up aimed at replenishing inventories depleted during the slump. <span class="companylink">UBS</span> analyst Maury Harris says a resulting rise in hiring and capital spending should lift customer demand, further boosting production. But citing weak consumer spending, Ore expects low growth into 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, pending home sales in September rose for the eighth- consecutive month, the longest streak since tracking began in 2001, says the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Pending sales of homes climbed 6.1% over August. The index is at a nearly three-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is getting home values to start to stabilize," says Lawrence Yun, NAR NAR chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home sales rally has been traced to a tax credit of up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers that's set to expire Nov. 30. If Congress passes an extension and expands it to include some current homeowners, the surge could continue in 2010, says Bernard Baumohl of Economic Outlook Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revived housing market is lifting construction spending. It jumped 0.8% in September from August, the Census Bureau said. Single- family building rose 2.4%, and remodeling was up 7.2%, but multifamily fell 4.1% amid an oversupply of homes and tight credit. Non-residential slipped 1.8% in the face of a severe commercial real estate downturn.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">More walk away from homes, mortgages ; With loans underwater, some choose voluntary foreclosure</span>
</div><div class="author">Stephanie Armour  </div><div>1517 words</div><div>3 November 2009</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2009 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction ran 11/5/2009: A story Tuesday misstated the eligibility rules for mortgage loan modifications under the federal government's Making Home Affordable program. The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) does not have any loan-to-value limits. Refinancings under the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) are limited to 125% of the home's value. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Sharon Sakson was laid off recently from her job as a television writer and producer, she burned through her savings to pay the $2,400 monthly mortgage on her home. But she soon decided it didn't make sense: Her home was worth thousands less than the mortgage she carried on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home had been appraised at $390,000 when she refinanced in 2006, but she estimates it's not worth the $320,000 it initially cost in 2004. So Sakson did what a growing number of homeowners are doing today: She stopped paying and decided to let the bank take her home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm walking away from my house," says Sakson, 57, who stopped making payments about six months ago on her home in Pennington, N.J. "The bank can have it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Sakson did is called a strategic default, or a voluntary foreclosure, and it's fast becoming a major challenge to the government's $75 billion effort to keep distressed borrowers in their homes. Walking away from a mortgage is serious business -- it can knock 100 points off your credit score and make you ineligible for a new mortgage for seven years. Yet, about 588,000 borrowers walked away from homes last year, double the number in 2007, according to a recent study by credit-scoring firm Experian and management consultants <span class="companylink">Oliver Wyman</span>. While home prices are rising, the increases pale compared with overall drops in home prices since 2005 that threaten to push millions more homeowners into Sakson's predicament, owing more than their homes are worth and seeing little chance of rebuilding equity soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More will walk away, which will hamper the housing recovery, reinforce lenders' tight credit policies and drag on the economy's recovery, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's increasingly a more important factor driving the foreclosure crisis," says Mark Zandi, of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "As we move forward, the job market will stabilize, and the big thing will be strategic defaults. People are going to determine it doesn't make financial sense to hold on to their homes. That's going to be a significant problem. Strategic defaults mean foreclosures could be high for a long time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just economists who are concerned about strategic defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage unit of <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> says one in five borrowers who defaults does so willingly, even though they're able to pay the mortgage. "It's a very large number, and it's a very, very significant risk to the housing recovery," says Sanjiv Das, CEO of <span class="companylink">CitiMortgage</span>, adding that new government programs to curb strategic defaults may be needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waiting for prices to stabilize</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How bad the strategic defaults issue gets may depend on how much more home prices fall and whether the government does more to help homeowners with mortgages larger than their homes' value. Both Zandi and Das suggest further actions to reduce mortgage principal for underwater borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A better way to do it may be an incentive to stay current for a period, and after two years of being current, they get a principal reduction," says Das.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's current Making Homes Affordable program for mortgage modifications disqualifies borrowers whose unpaid mortgages are more than 125% of the home's market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, median prices have fallen about 25% from their peak in late 2005, although prices recently have risen compared with prior months this year. The median price in the second quarter -- $170,000 -- was at roughly the level it was in autumn 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But price declines have been worse in some markets. A closely watched barometer of home prices, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case- Shiller 20-City Composite Index, shows they have fallen more than 25% in 12 markets and more than 50% in two -- Phoenix and Las Vegas - - from peaks hit in 2006 or 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifteen out of the 20 metro areas saw a rise in prices from July to August, but those increases are not anywhere close to the losses that have already occurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of borrowers who walk away is expected to increase, along with the rise in homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth. An unprecedented 16 million homeowners currently are underwater, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. That's about a third of all homeowners with a first mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com estimates the number of underwater borrowers will peak at 17.4 million in the third quarter of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An even higher estimate comes from <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, which predicted in an August study that the number of homeowners underwater will grow from 14 million (or 27% of all homeowners with mortgages) in 2009 to 25 million homeowners, or 48% of all those with a mortgage, by the time home prices stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not coincidentally, strategic defaults have been highest where prices have plunged most, such as California and Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2005 to 2008, the number of strategic defaulters went up by 68 times in California, according to the Experian-Oliver Wyman study published in September. During that same time period, the median price for existing, single-family homes in California fell from $522,670 in 2005 to $346,410, according to the California Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other geographic regions, the increase in strategic defaulters ranged between 3 times and 18 times more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Experian-Wyman study found borrowers with higher credit scores when they applied for their loan were 50% more likely than other types of borrowers to walk away from a mortgage only because they were underwater, even though they could afford to pay. The study was based on an analysis of about 12 million borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No household would default if the equity shortfall is less than 10% of the value of the house, according to another study this year, done by the University of Chicago, Northwestern University and the European University Institute. But 17% of households would default, even if they could afford to pay their mortgage, when the equity shortfall reaches 50% of the value of their house. That means the market value of a mortgage property is that much below the amount of loan taken against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also appears to be a contagion effect. Borrowers who know someone who defaulted are 82% more likely to declare their intention to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing acceptance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The most disturbing aspect of this is that it's becoming acceptable to do," says Joel Naroff, an economist with Naroff Economic Advisors. "What does that mean down the road for housing and the economy if people are happy to walk away and destroy their credit? They're saying, 'Why pay a high amount if they can get something, even a rental, for less?' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the time and expense involved in completing a foreclosure, borrowers who decide to walk away often wind up staying in their homes for months after they stop paying their mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most states, lenders can go after homeowners for past-due payments, but many fail to take such action when borrowers abandon their properties, because the legal costs are so high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales, in which lenders agree to the sale of a home for less than the balance of the mortgage, is an alternative to a strategic default. Many lenders are now encouraging them, but Zandi says that alternative may seem too time-consuming for borrowers who want to quickly get out from under their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Janet Speer, 51, isn't happy to be walking away from her 200- year-old home in Royersford, Pa., but she doesn't feel ashamed. Speer says she was paying about $1,400 a month for her home, which was appraised at about $155,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After getting laid off last year, Speer said, she tried to modify her mortgage to more affordable terms but was denied because her unemployment benefits and alimony didn't count as income. Speer stopped paying on her mortgage in September 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is still living in the home and waiting to be foreclosed upon. Speer is saving her unemployment benefits for an apartment once the bank takes over her home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I got letters and calls from the bank at first, but they stopped," said Speer, who now earns commission income from a job in the health care industry. "I have a three-story house. It's way too big. I just want a little two-bedroom apartment. I don't want this place anymore. I would never have chosen to do this, but it's going to work out."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when many cities are seeing home sales climb back up after plunging, Peoria, Ill.'s housing market is doing the opposite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were down 15.5% in September compared with the same month in 2008. And they have been falling since January, following years of improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This has been our most challenging year," says Bill Embry, president of the Peoria Area Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That seems baffling, because Peoria tends to outperform the rest of the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the last 12 months, Illinois lost 5% of the employment base, but Peoria had only declined by about 3%," says Geoffrey Hewings, director of the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory at the University of Illinois.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the recession, Peoria's diverse economy helped it remain more robust. This year, it was named the fifth-best midsize city in which to launch a small business, according to CNNMoney.com. And Caterpillar is its biggest employer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many years, Peoria has experienced a strong and stable housing market. From 1996 through 2006, home sales improved gradually every year. And home prices never had a big surge or collapse, Embry says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city was immune to the housing bubble that hit many other metro areas. And until this year, the housing market was not severely affected by the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no market seems to be recession-proof. Even though the federal first-time home-buyers tax credit has helped sales in Peoria, it has not stopped the decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This year, I think we finally felt the effect of the national economy," Embry says. "The drop could be tied to people's perceptions and fears. They hear the news, and it makes them question if they should be doing anything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are low, home prices are affordable, and there is a good supply for home buyers, so if the economy improves, real estate agents hope to see a rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've always been a pocket of prosperity," Embry says. "Because we've got jobs, people will buy houses."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive home</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 60% of Americans don't have a basic will. There are all kinds of reasons for this oversight. Some people just haven't gotten around to creating a will or trust. Others think they don't need an estate plan because they don't have much. Some people fear that as soon as they write a will, they'll die.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reality, there's no evidence to suggest that creating an estate plan will hasten your demise. This much is certain, though: You're not going to live forever. And if you die without an estate plan, you could leave a legacy of bad feelings and attorneys' fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week is National Estate Planning Awareness Week, an educational program sponsored by the National Association of Estate Planners &amp; Councils. In conjunction with the event, today's Managing Your Money dissects five myths about estate planning and offers tips on how to make things easier for your loved ones after you're gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Estate planning is for rich people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless you live in a cave and subsist on roots and berries, you need a will. A will allows you to designate who will receive your property when you die. If you die without one, your assets will be distributed under the terms of your state's "intestate succession" laws. That means your money and property could end up with family members you haven't spoken to in years, instead of a close friend or a charity you support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if you don't have much money, most estate plans include a durable power of attorney for finances and a health care directive, "And those are two things everybody needs," says Donna Bashaw, an elder-law attorney in Laguna Hills, Calif. These documents allow you to designate someone to act on your behalf if you become incapacitated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, a will allows you to name a guardian for your children if something should happen to you. Otherwise, a court will appoint a guardian, and it may not be the individual you would choose to bring up your kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A will doesn't have to be expensive, says Liza Hanks, an attorney and author of The Mom's Guide to Wills &amp; Estate Planning. Do-it- yourself programs, such as Quicken's WillMaker Plus and LegalZoom, are fine for a basic will, she says. While some people fear these programs won't be honored in court, "The law is pretty client- friendly with respect to wills," Hanks says. "Judges want to honor people's last requests."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a trust, you should hire an estate-planning lawyer, Hanks says. And even if your will is pretty straightforward, you may feel more comfortable hiring a lawyer to guide you through the process, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. If I die without a will, everything will go to my spouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not necessarily, says Ronald Fatoullah, an estate-planning attorney in New York. State laws vary, but in most states, if you die without a will (intestate), your inheritance will be divided among your spouse and your children. In New York, for example, when someone dies intestate, the spouse gets the first $50,000 of the estate and what's left is divided 50-50 among the spouse and the children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This can create all kinds of problems, particularly if your spouse was financially dependent on you or you have children from a previous marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. If I have a will, my estate won't go through probate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All wills are subject to probate, says Craig Hersch, a trust and estates attorney in Fort Myers, Fla. In probate, a court determines whether the document is valid and ensures that relatives and creditors are notified. This process can take several months and drain thousands of dollars from your estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to avoid probate is to put your property into a living trust. A living trust is a legal document you create to hold property, such as brokerage accounts and real estate. When you die, the property is transferred to your beneficiaries. This transfer occurs outside of probate, which could save your heirs a lot of time and money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone needs a trust, Bashaw says. In some states, she says, "Probate is a very easy process, and it isn't necessarily something you need to avoid," she says. Some states exempt up to $100,000 from probate. In others, such as California, probate is a slow and expensive process, Hanks says. In that case, setting up a trust could save your heirs thousands of dollars in legal fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you own property in more than one state, a living trust "is a no-brainer," Fatoullah says. Otherwise, your estate might have to go through probate in several states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another advantage to a living trust is privacy. A will is a public document, and anyone can come to the probate hearing to see if any fights break out. Living trusts "aren't published in any courthouse, so people can't gain easy access to them." Hersch says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. After I create my will or living trust, I'm all set.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a common misconception and leads to a lot of problems later on, estate-planning attorneys say. Once you set up a trust, for example, you need to retitle the assets you want to transfer to the trust, Hersch says. Otherwise, the document is worthless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, you'll need to periodically update your will or trust to reflect major life events, such as a divorce or the birth of a child. You'll also want to revisit your estate plan if you move to another state. You should meet with your attorney every four or five years to discuss changes in your circumstances that could affect your estate plan, says Matt McClintock, co-chief executive for WealthCounsel, a group of estate-planning attorneys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. I could be held responsible for a deceased parent's debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you're grieving, the last thing you need is a call from a debt collector, telling you you're responsible for Dad's credit card. Those callers aren't just intrusive -- they're wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, children aren't responsible for a deceased parent's debts, Hersch says. Even a spouse's obligation to pay those debts may be limited, depending on state probate laws. (Surviving spouses should consult with an attorney.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate is responsible for paying debts. If there isn't enough in the estate to cover the amount owed, the debts usually go unpaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a debt collector contacts you, give the caller the name of the executor of the estate, or the administrator if your parent died without a will. The executor or administrator is responsible for settling the estate, including paying debts. Report any problems with debt collectors to your state attorney general's office, www.naag.org[http://www.naag.org], and the Federal Trade Commission, www.ftc.gov[http://www.ftc.gov].</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steamboat Springs has cultivated an image as a ski bum paradise, where slopes meet the wooden sidewalks of the Old West. But now, with a billion-dollar urban renewal project and more than $30 million in ski area improvements, it's attracting more second-home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steamboat, which bears the trademarked name "Ski Town USA," has several things that set it apart from other Colorado ski towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, there's the snow, which is among the driest and deepest in the country (canny developers also trademarked the phrase "Champagne Powder"). Situated in north-central Colorado, the mountain catches the state's blizzards as well as those that hit Utah and Wyoming and has averaged more than 400 inches of snow the past two winters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resort also is a family-friendly destination, ranked best in North America by SKI magazine. In addition to the major Steamboat resort, with its acclaimed children's instruction programs, the municipally owned Howelsen Hill has long been a training ground for local kids and future Olympians. Both offer specials aimed at children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final attraction is the town itself, just over 2 miles from the ski resort. "People come because they saw the mountain ranked top five by the ski magazines, but then they see Old Town and say, 'Wow, this is cool,' " says David Baldinger Jr., owner of Steamboat Village Brokers. Lincoln Avenue is the main drag, and it has a traditional Main Street setup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another difference between Steamboat and other top ski towns is the variety of prices. "You can still buy a ski-in/ski-out one- bedroom condo in the $200,000s," Baldinger says. "And there will be a $4 million house a stone's throw away."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Steamboat Ski Resort. The base area has a mix of condos and older houses, but the newest projects are also here, including One Steamboat Place. Opening in December, the luxury condos were priced $2.7 to $4.4 million, with fractional options as well (onesteamboatplace.com). Older condos begin in the high $200,000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Old Town. Steamboat Springs has a variety of shops and restaurants; thanks to lower prices, it is popular with year-round residents. "Only about 20% of the residences here are second homes," says realty agent David Baldinger Jr. A three-bedroom single-family house with a mountain view can be had for under $800,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Surrounding ranches and estates. "We don't have the kind of subdivisions that surround a lot of Colorado towns," Baldinger says. Instead, legacy ranches have been developed into estate homes with community amenities. The most established is the Catamount Ranch and Club, with a golf course, private lake and houses averaging around $4 million (catamountranchclub.com).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Duluth, Minn., which is on the north shore of Lake Superior, home sales slow when Arctic winter air hits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though snow has already fallen, local real estate agents are still busy this year. "We are working overtime to get all of the first-time home-buyer sales closed before the $8,000 tax credit expires on Nov. 30," says Mike Peller, president of the Duluth Area Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those sales don't show up in recent home sales reports. Sales were down 11.6% in August, compared with August last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And from January to August, all home sales were down 4% from the same period of 2008. But sales of homes under $150,000 were up 9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first-time home-buyer stimulus has been fabulous," Peller says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike many other metro areas, Duluth largely avoided the housing bubble. "We never had a huge housing boom," says Jim Skurla, director of Business and Economic Research at the University of Minnesota-Duluth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its housing market has always been stable and slow-growing. As a result, there was not a lot of speculative housing, and when the bottom fell out of the national market, the region didn't have a glut of empty houses, Peller says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Duluth's housing market has not been insulated from the recession. The city's unemployment rate has risen, although not as high as the state's. Even many families not hit by unemployment have been holding back on home purchases.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- The massive wildfires that scorched hundreds of square miles last month have left behind a new threat: large, fast- moving rock and mudslides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heavy rainstorms this week prompted the placement of sandbags and concrete barriers in communities along the San Gabriel Mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rain fell short of forecasts on Wednesday, but further rainfall on steep terrain shorn of vegetation and tree canopy in the Angeles National Forest could trigger flows of home-crushing debris, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) warned in a recent report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This storm was actually a very nice practice storm," says Susan Cannon, a research geologist who co-authored the study. "It just didn't have the punch. Sadly, that doesn't mean the hazard is gone or the risk has decreased at all."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The threat won't be easing anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jody Noiron, the U.S. Forest Service supervisor of the Angeles National Forest, said scientists who have studied the burn area estimate it will take three to five years for the ground to recover enough vegetation to regain stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the Station Fire, which burned 251 square miles of mountains, was particularly hot, leaving behind loose, uncovered soil that is quick to dislodge and slide down steep terrain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's all going to be about the rain -- how much we get, how long it rains, the intensity of the rain -- that will determine what those slopes see," Noiron said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is not just a one-year deal. When you have these watersheds burned like this, it could take three to five years before they recover."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pacific storm delivered most of its rainfall in the northern and central areas of California, knocking out power to nearly 700,000 customers from Bakersfield northward. In Watsonville, east of Monterey Bay, 40 homes were evacuated because of mudslides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Weather Service said up to a foot of rain fell in some spots of central California. The 2 inches that fell on Los Angeles was the first recorded since June 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works closed public access to all county roads within the burn area for at least 48 hours. The U.S. Forest Service evacuated some employees from the forest and brought in concrete barricades to protect fire and ranger stations from slides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tens of thousands of people live in the communities at the foothills of the San Gabriel range, to the east of Interstate 210, the Foothill Freeway. The city offered free sandbags to residents and installed concrete barriers on some streets to divert any debris flows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a serious threat for communities in the major drainage basins of the mountain front, including Big Tujunga Canyon, Arroyo Seco, Pacoima Canyon, West Fork of the San Gabriel River and Devils Canyon, the USGS said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the report based on surveys and computer models, USGS scientists warned that some watersheds in the burn area could see debris flows of 100,000 cubic yards of material -- enough to fill a football field 60 feet deep with mud and rock. It said that in the affected areas, the probabilities were high and the magnitudes of debris possible were large, based on a moderate rainstorm of the size received every one to two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cannon, a geologist at the USGS offices in Golden, Colo., said the San Gabriel Mountains are particularly vulnerable to slides because they have some of the steepest slopes of any range.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cowboy culture in Cody, Wyo., gave the town's housing market some leverage, until recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The popular frontier town founded by Buffalo Bill Cody largely fended off the housing bubble, and it has dodged most of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have been bucking the trend of the nation," says Rob Godby, chairman of the University of Wyoming's Department of Economics and Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the housing market has been recently squeezed. In August, home sales were down 31.6% compared with the same month last year, and home prices were down 15.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The last year has been a different market for us," says John Krebes, president of the Northwest Wyoming Board of Realtors. The economic downturn has trickled into Cody, which is the eastern gateway to Yellowstone National Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even the recession didn't hold back visitors. Cody is a popular vacation spot for families who want to see the Wild West town, then go to Yellowstone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, it saw a record number of tourists. Even so, there was a downside. Many visitors traveled on a budget, staying in campsites rather than hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Foot traffic was high, but sales were down," Godby says. "Upper- end restaurants and accommodations are having a rougher year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cody's economy is mostly driven by tourism. Although its unemployment rate is much lower than the national rate, it has recently jumped. In August, the jobless rate reached 4.7%, up from 2.7% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cody's housing market has benefited from the first-time home- buyer federal tax credit. But home inventory is up, high-end homes are not moving quickly and construction has slowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local housing market has two tiers. The town of Cody has many bungalows and small, single-family homes. This year, homes priced between $140,000 and $250,000 have been the most popular sellers, Krebes says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside town, in the beautiful valley between Cody and Yellowstone, there are many large, high-price vacation homes. People from as far as California and Illinois buy the trophy homes, Krebes says. But now, the recession is hurting those sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have been sliding this year, and real estate agents hope that will attract more buyers. "It wasn't the best year," Godby says. "But it was a pretty good year, all things considered."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median-price home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This home, built in 1953, is on the market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greater Myrtle Beach has more than 100 golf courses and is synonymous with bargain-priced golf (not to mention mini-golf). But the area's low cost of living is not limited to hotels and greens fees: It is also a very reasonably priced second-home destination, as many buyers have discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home of the "shag" dance, Myrtle Beach already was booming as a beach resort by the 1950s. Today the city is the anchor of 12 adjoining municipalities that make up the Grand Strand, a 60-mile crescent-shaped section of coastal beaches -- with a staggering 1,700 restaurants and over 400 hotels and motels. The city is the Grand Strand's heart, with many restaurants, bars, live entertainment venues, malls, and other tourist attractions, while the surrounding towns are smaller and sleepier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Golf is omnipresent here, and although priced low, the quality is high: About half the courses are rated four stars or better by Golf Digest. Most courses have condos or houses, and most residential developments have at least one course -- or several. But the beaches were the original draw, and remain the primary influence on real estate prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We call ourselves the golf capital, but it is really all about the beaches," says Al Heath, a broker with Prudential Burroughs &amp; Chapin Realty. "The Grand Strand runs up and down the coast, so in every town you have a broad range of prices, varying greatly based on how far you are from the ocean." The Intracoastal Waterway parallels the ocean several miles inland, a second coastline that is "very popular with boaters, lots of marinas and restaurants."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the appeals is that real estate is inexpensive for a resort area," Heath says. "It's not Aspen. You can get a golf- course condo in the city for $129,000."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at three Greater Myrtle Beach neighborhoods:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*City of Myrtle Beach: The downtown is full of theme restaurants, nightclubs and malls. It's also home to the most desirable real estate, such as Grande Dunes, a 2,200-acre development that runs from the ocean to the Intracoastal Waterway, with two golf courses, nine restaurants, a beach club, marina and resort hotel. While Grande Dunes has oceanfront luxury condos averaging more than $2 million, it also offers condos from $200,000 and single-family houses in the $300,000s (grandedunes.com). Elsewhere in the city, condos begin around $130,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*North Strand: Communities north of Myrtle Beach proper, stretching all the way to the North Carolina border, include Atlantic Beach, North Myrtle Beach and Little River. "It's quieter, more old-fashioned beach towns, and Little River is a real fishing town," says real estate agent Al Heath. "It's even more affordable than the city; you can get single-family homes less than 5 miles from the beach for $170,000."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*South Strand: The south end is quieter, with the fishing hamlet of Murrells Inlet. Though it has the same low-priced offerings as the north, it also has some higher-priced luxury enclaves, especially on Pawleys Island. Litchfield Plantation is a 600-acre low-density community with custom homes from $550,000 to $850,000, about half of which are second homes (litchfieldplantation.com). Just south of the city is Surfside Beach, offering residences from around $170,000 with convenient access to the action of Myrtle Beach.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Hampshire's Mt. Washington routinely records some of the most frigid temperatures in the USA, so it's no surprise that cold- weather aficionados flock to the state for winter sports. New Hampshire ski resorts have been popular second-home destinations for well over half a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason is convenience. Nearly all of the larger mountains are 90 to 180 minutes from Boston. Nearly half the visitors come from Massachusetts, with the balance made up by southern New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reasons for the region's strong appeal are its summer activities and famed fall foliage season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of people came through the door and discovered the area because of skiing, but by the time they buy they have discovered summer as well," says Kevin Killourie, a broker at Badger Realty in North Conway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Killourie estimates that 60% to 65% of the homes he sells are vacation properties. "The majority of our buyers are using their houses year-round."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 2.5 million skiers visit every year, and most of the state's major mountains have made significant capital improvements for the upcoming season, such as new lifts and increased snowmaking. Ski New Hampshire, the state's trade group, has 36 downhill areas and 19 cross-country centers in its membership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the large resorts are in two regions. The Mt. Washington Valley in the northeast surrounds the town of North Conway. A stretch of interstate in the north-central part of the state nicknamed "Ski 93" includes several large mountains in close proximity. Both regions are part of the White Mountain chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third cluster includes a few mountains in the state's southern Lakes Region, including Mt. Sunapee and Ragged Mountain. The second homes here draw more summer buyers interested in water activities.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at three area neighborhoods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Waterville Valley: Surrounded by more than 700,000 acres of national forest, the 500-acre master-planned ski resort community has more than 1,000 houses and condos and just 278 full-time residents. "There's a lot of second- and third-generation buyers who came here as kids with their parents," says Jeffrey Brown, an agent with Waterville Valley Realty. Condos range from $70,000 to $555,000 and houses from $490,000 to $1.7 million. (wvnh.com)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Ski 93: Besides Waterville Valley, the major resorts are Loon and Cannon Mountain, both near the larger town of North Woodstock. Cannon is owned and operated by the state's parks department and is home to a famed aerial tramway. Loon has the most ownership options, with numerous base-area townhouses from $200,000. A wide array of single family vacation homes in and around North Woodstock can be found in the $300,000-$500,000 range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Mt. Washington Valley: The Valley consists of North Conway, Conway, Madison, Bartlett and Jackson, and includes ski areas such as Attitash, Cranmore, Bretton Woods and Wildcat. Unlike most ski resorts, vacation homes are based around the towns, not slopes, and real-estate agent Kevin Killourie estimates there are 50 condo developments in greater North Conway alone. "We were a town before the skiing," he says. A three-bedroom house or condo can be had for $225,000-$250,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daytona Beach, Fla., is a buyer's market, as home prices continue to tumble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home values have never been so good," says Marge Allison, president of Daytona Beach Area Association of Realtors. And that is enticing many buyers who could not afford a home when the market boomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, home sales were up 20% compared with the same month last year. Home prices, though, went in the opposite direction, falling 19%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Properties are still selling at a deep discount because short sales and foreclosures saturate the market. In the first half of the year, Daytona Beach's foreclosure rate ranked among the top 20 metro foreclosure rates in the country, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of continuing job losses, many homeowners have not been able to keep up with their mortgage payments, and they are giving up their homes. "Those homes are now added to the heap of foreclosures," says Sean Snaith, an economic forecaster at the University of Central Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $8,000 federal tax credit has helped many first-time home buyers take advantage of the pricing. Agents are trying to finish deals before the tax credit expires on Nov. 30, while the industry is lobbying Congress to extend it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even though home buyers have many houses to choose from, sales are not always happening quickly because it's harder to get a mortgage. "The loan requirements are very stringent," Allison says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even if a home buyer finds a great deal, it may not go through over worries about a job loss, she says. In July, the unemployment rate in Daytona Beach reached 11.2%, higher than the national rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even though the market has not yet leveled off, it seems to be heading in that direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If they (buyers) wait for the bottom, the bottom will be here and gone before they realize it," Allison says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Snaith says the market is in the midst of recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'd liken it to removing the bodies from the battlefield," he says. "It doesn't mean that the war is over. But it's an important step."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most-expensive home</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the world's most famous neighborhoods, Hollywood is known for movies, celebrities and its star-studded Walk of Fame. Now, almost a century after the first movie studio opened in 1911, it might become known for second homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about 1,500 residences in the Hollywood core, but nearly double that number, or 2,736 new units, are under construction or planned for the next four years, according to the Hollywood Entertainment District, a business improvement organization created by the city of Los Angeles. Most new units are apartments, and many are "adaptive reuses," or loft conversions -- among them The Lofts @ Hollywood and Vine, the W Hotel &amp; Residences and The Broadway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hollywood is still mainly a primary-residence market, but the new buildings are attracting out-of-towners. Many are bicoastal people with regular work or leisure trips to Los Angeles who are buying instead of staying in increasingly pricey hotels. The area is especially attractive to East Coast urbanites because it is one of the few parts of L.A. condensed enough to appeal to walkers. It also has many of the city's hottest restaurants and nightclubs and is active at all hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly half of the Loft buyers have been second-home owners, developers there say. At the new W, "the majority of owners have other residences, with some having several," developer Marty Collins says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Yorkers will be used to the high prices: Realtor Russell Roney of ZipRealty says a new apartment that might cost $300,000 in nearby downtown L.A. can run $800,000 in Hollywood.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at three Hollywood neighborhoods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hollywood. "Downtown Hollywood" is centered along Hollywood Boulevard between the LaBrea Gateway to the west and Hollywood Freeway/101 to the east. The neighborhood is mostly condos, many of them newly converted buildings. The 60 units in the Lofts @ Hollywood and Vine (theloftsathollywoodandvine.com) range from the high $300,000s to just over $1 million, and the 143 apartments at the new W fetch $800,000 to more than $9 million (whollywoodresidence.com).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hollywood Hills. Overlooking Hollywood from the site of the famous hillside sign, this area is the most expensive and almost exclusively single-family houses. Real estate agent Russell Roney says the market for second homes is very small, just a niche for celebrities and studio executives; prices are from $800,000, and most are in the millions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*West Hollywood. Home to a large gay community, West Hollywood is sandwiched between Hollywood proper and Beverly Hills, and much of it has a distinctly suburban feel. But "WeHo" also contains its own vibrant core, with the famed Sunset Strip and Santa Monica Boulevard. Mainly single-family houses, it has the most moderate price range, from the mid-$400,000s to just over $1 million. Many options are in the $600,000-$800,000 range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">W Residences</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bathrooms: 2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Size: 1,815 square feet (+ 678 terrace)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Features: This unit features luxury appliances and fixtures and finishes such as Brazilian limestone bathroom floors and built-in closet organizational systems. The large outdoor terrace is professionally landscaped. Building amenities include a rooftop pool with cabanas, outdoor movie theater, restaurant and spa.</p>

The building has a rooftop garden deck, parking and security.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">August home sales waned after growing strongly the past four months, a sign that the housing recovery hasn't yet hit its stride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes dropped 2.7% in August from July, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported Thursday. In the previous four months, sales had increased a total of 15%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.1 million -- below what many analysts had forecast, although still the second- highest level of sales activity in nearly two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a little disappointing," says Lawrence Yun, chief NAR economist, adding that the drop in sales indicates a continued need for federal stimulus efforts. "We're on the cusp of a self- sufficient recovery. There may still be some consumer fear, and the stimulus measure is (aimed) at changing that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline came even though the average interest rate on a 30- year fixed mortgage fell from 5.22% in July to 5.19% in August, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. It was at 5.04% for the week ended Sept. 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices also slid. The national median existing-home price was $177,700 in August, down 12.5% from August 2008, according to the NAR report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices may be down in part because distressed homes, which include foreclosed properties, made up about 30% of sales. Homes sold at foreclosure often go for prices as much as 20% below those of non-distressed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Naroff, of Naroff Economic Advisors, says the drop in sales does not mean that the housing recovery is faltering. Economic indicators often fluctuate as a downturn ends, he says, so no one should expect consistently better numbers each month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're still moving forward," Naroff says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One improvement is a shrinking inventory of unsold homes. At the end of August, that inventory represented an 8.5-month supply at the current sales rate, down from 9.3 months in July. Unsold inventory totals are 16.4% lower than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yun says the dip in sales shows the need for Congress to continue stimulus measures such as the tax credit of up to $8,000 for first- time home buyers. Buyers now have until Nov. 30 to close on a home to take advantage of the credit; first-time home buyers make up about 30% of home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernard Baumohl, chief economist of The Economic Outlook Group, says the challenge now is to sustain the current housing recovery, which is threatened by high unemployment and the likelihood of higher interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We may see mortgage rates of 5.5% next year and 6% by the end of next year," Baumohl says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as Cedar Rapids, Iowa, plowed into the recession last year, a flood devastated the city, wiping out or damaging more than 5,300 homes and 700 businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The flood peaked at nearly 15 feet higher than it ever had before, and it completely inundated its downtown," says David Swenson, an economist at Iowa State University. Damage estimates were more than $6 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somehow, though, the city's housing market has been more stable than other parts of the country. Houses are being built in a different part of the city, and businesses are reopening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even in the face of the disaster, some people are rebounding," says Cherokee Render, president of Cedar Rapids Area Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the disaster, home sales did not plummet, and are down 2.1% in July, compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although many people lost their homes, they have been able to get federal disaster loans and grants. That has helped some move up to a slightly higher-end home, Render says. Others are gutting their homes and building from scratch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are selling homes, and we believe that the $8,000 tax credit also has helped immensely," she says of the first-time home-buyer's credit. In particular, homes for $200,000 or less are selling. She predicts sales will remain steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike many other metro areas, the Cedar Rapids housing market does not have peaks and valleys, nor has it experienced a surge in home foreclosure. "Midwest bankers tend to be more conservative," Swenson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is also fortunate because it has a diversified and dynamic local economy. It is home to <span class="companylink">General Mills</span>, Quaker Oats, Cargill and <span class="companylink">Rockwell Collins</span>, which provides communication and aviation electronic solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's unemployment rate inched up to 6% in July, but it was less than the state of Iowa, which was 6.8%, and the nation, which hit 9.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You hate to say that a disaster is an opportunity," Swenson says. "But we know it makes the city reconfigure and re-evaluate its growth. And they are up to their hips in planning."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Americans found housing unaffordable last year, even though home prices across the U.S. have taken a major fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 40 million spent 30% or more of their household income on housing costs, 600,000 more than in 2007, according to 2008 Census data released Monday. That includes homeowners with and without mortgages, as well as renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of renters increased, while the number of homeowners declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bright spot: The share of homeowners with mortgages spending nearly a third of their income on housing held stable in 2008, after steady increases since 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly two in five homeowners with mortgages and half of renters paid 30% or more of their before-tax income on housing costs, which is the limit the government sets for determining that housing is unaffordable, according to an analysis of Census data done for USA TODAY by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing costs for homeowners include mortgage payments, taxes, insurance and utilities. Renter costs include rent and utilities, if they are paid separately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices of homes this year are down more than 20% compared with the peak of the housing bubble in 2006, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although housing affordability for newly purchased homes has improved, overall affordability for renters or owners is unchanged or worse because of the economy," says Daniel McCue, research analyst at Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. "People are still hurting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer homeowners</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflecting the rapid pace of foreclosures, the number of homeowners dropped by about 142,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2007 to 2008 the homeownership rate fell more than half a percentage point, to 66.6% -- the lowest level since 2002, says Mark Mather, a vice president at the Population Reference Bureau in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those former homeowners have become renters, a segment feeling the brunt of steep housing costs. About half of renters spend at least 30% of their before-tax pay for housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the number of renters swelled by nearly 900,000 in 2008 compared with 2007. In the same time, renters stretching financially to make their rent rose by 601,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fact that affordability for renters is getting worse shows the impact of the economic downturn," McCue says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters are also more likely to be severely financially burdened. One in four paid half or more of their incomes for housing last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The average monthly rent for a Manhattan apartment is still very high for most people," says Matthew Baron, who co-owns a $300 million portfolio of multifamily and other buildings in the New York area. "We are also seeing a lot of people double or triple up with roommates in order to split the high rental costs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Census data show affordability remains difficult in many states, even in those hard hit by foreclosures and falling home values. Median housing costs for owners with mortgages, after adjusting for inflation, increased in 2008 from 2007 for nine states and decreased for eight states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's partly because existing homeowners aren't receiving the benefits of cheaper housing. They are often stuck in their properties, owing more than their homes are worth but unable to find a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami stretch</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the top 100 metro areas, most of the top 10 least affordable ones for mortgage owners were in California and the rest were in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in 2007, Miami-Fort Lauderdale remained one of the largest metro areas where a high percentage of homeowners spent at least 30% of their income on housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our home prices are already higher than most areas," says Mike Premny, a broker and owner of Icon Capital Group in San Francisco. "People here understand our housing market is unique and (will pay more)."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says banks may approve loans where borrowers put a greater amount of their income for a mortgage if they have solid credit and make large down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Kerr, a Realtor with Zip Realty in the San Francisco area, says buyers are willing to stretch because they believe their home equity will grow over time. First-time buyers especially are willing to spend a higher proportion of their incomes to become owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To be able to have a house they want, it's worth having peanut butter sandwiches for a year," Kerr says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the credit and housing bubbles burst, lawmakers of both parties said they were surprised at the impossibly large mortgages so many homeowners had taken out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They shouldn't have been, not any more than the fabled Capt. Renault was "shocked, shocked" that gambling was going on in his favorite Casablanca casino. Through a never-ending series of new tax breaks and subsidies, and the expansion of existing ones, Congress and successive presidents have done everything in their power to get people to take on mortgage debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have allowed borrowers to deduct interest on mortgages up to a $1 million. They have set the capital gains tax rate at 0% on profits from the sale of a primary residence, up to $500,000. And they have created and nurtured <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-backed companies that dominate the mortgage industry, to expand lending to questionable borrowers, putting taxpayers at risk of multibillion dollar losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When all this produced a colossal housing bust, sending the economy toward free fall, Congress passed and President Obama signed a "temporary" tax credit of $8,000 for first-time home buyers as part of the economic stimulus program. Now the threat of depression is gone, but with the credit set to expire on Nov. 30, the housing lobby is pushing to have it extended. Some in Congress even want to expand it to $15,000 and make it apply to all home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ironically, though virtually all Republicans voted against the stimulus and continue to lambaste it, the biggest champion of expanding the housing program is Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., a former Realtor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a variety of reasons, the credit should be allowed to expire. To begin with, the housing market is starting to recover. The National Association of Realtors has reported four straight months of increased sales of existing homes. Moreover, tax credits are just another form of government spending, and the government -- which is running a $1.6 trillion deficit this year -- doesn't have any money to spend. Extending the credit, which has already cost as much as $15 billion, would mean borrowing even more from future generations to aid today's home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps most important, an array of influential lobbies -- bankers, automakers and so on -- will be watching to see whether Washington has the fortitude to wind down a stimulus program once it has begun to throw money at an influential industry. The housing lobby isn't the only one salivating at the federal feeding trough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The untold truth of housing tax breaks is that they don't really make owning a home more affordable. That's because markets have a way of adjusting. If the government subsidizes home buying, it increases the number of people in the market and the amount they can afford to pay, which drives up prices of existing homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the home-building, mortgage-lending and real estate brokerage industries -- a potent three-pronged housing lobby -- this means bigger profits. But for prospective new homeowners, it does relatively little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters of expanding the credit for first-time buyers argue that now is no time to pull back. That is always their argument. Just as real estate agents say there is no bad time to purchase a home, for the housing lobby there is no bad time for a handout. Congress, however, shouldn't buy it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dramatic fall in home values over the past couple of years has been caused by one primary factor -- an oversupply of housing. That oversupply has created a vicious circle whereby values decline and potential home buyers, not wanting to buy into a falling market, sit on the sidelines and wait for a perceived bottom. This lack of demand then causes values to fall even further. And buyers continue to wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To address this, Congress created an $8,000 tax credit for new home buyers. This credit, along with lower mortgage rates, has helped to moderate the decline in home prices by stimulating demand. As many as 350,000 sales so far this year could be directly attributable to the tax credit, according to the National Association of Realtors. First-time buyers, who have been on the sideline, are taking advantage of the credit and are finally buying again, cutting into that oversupply of housing and buoying home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allowing the credit to expire would put in jeopardy the recent signs of recovery we are beginning to see in the housing market. Congress needs to act quickly in order to avoid a rush of borrowers overwhelming lenders and settlement service vendors by demanding to close before the tax credit expires on Nov. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, not only should the credit be extended, it should be expanded. Congress should extend it to all home buyers and increase the credit up to $15,000. In addition, Congress should make it available immediately, so that a borrower doesn't need to wait until his or her next tax return, but instead can use it to help make a down payment on the house or pay closing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expanding the tax credit would accelerate the recovery by stimulating demand among "move up" buyers, existing home buyers who want or need a larger house. This would spur buying and price stability in a new segment of the housing market, further accelerating an economic and housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home purchases also stimulate the broader economy. A study by the National Association of Home Builders shows that a typical buyer will spend $4,000 to $7,400 more than the non-moving home owner on the house in the first two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are finally starting to see good signs in the housing market, but the market is fragile. Allowing the home buyer tax credit to expire would put it all at risk.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This winter will be the 30th anniversary of the "Miracle on Ice," when a scrappy group of amateur U.S. hockey players upset the dominant Soviet Union at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. Three decades later, there is no Soviet Union, but Lake Placid is still thriving as a second-home destination -- in winter and in summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At least 70% of the market, maybe 80%, is second homes, and it has been that way ever since the Olympics," says real-estate agent Robert Politi, owner of Merrill L. Thomas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second homes have predated even the first Olympics held here, back in 1932. Lake Placid sits in the midst of the Adirondack wilderness, where wealthy New Yorkers built summer compounds known as "Great Camps" in the second half of the 19th century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are two kinds of second-home owners -- those who use their places for the whole summer, and those who come occasionally and rent them out," Politi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second-home buyers in Lake Placid live mostly within driving distance, coming from New York, Philadelphia, New Jersey and Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lake Placid visitors can see the hockey rink, tour the museum, ski the alpine and Nordic runs, even speedskate on the Oval and ride bobsleds. The ski jumps tower over the village, many Olympians live here (it has one of three major U.S. Olympic training centers), and major championships are held annually in skating, sliding and skiing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're famous for the winter, and weekends are busy in ski season, but in summer it is seven days a week," Politi says. The town's Ford Ironman Triathlon USA sells out every room for miles in July, but weeks of horse shows and other major events fuel a strong year-round rental market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the Adirondacks is designated "forever wild," New York's strictest zoning. Lakefront property is the most desirable, often with boathouses. Adirondack-style houses on Lake Placid start at $3 million but cost much less on surrounding lakes. In the village, Politi says "the hot part of the market right now is homes under $500,000."</p>

The small downtown is mostly condos, starting in the high $200,000s, but the houses on the lake, all within walking distance of shops and restaurants, start at $1 million. The Lake Placid Club, a former resort with two golf courses and beach club, is being redeveloped as a residential community, with lots starting at $385,000 and five condos from $450,000 to $675,000 (lakeplacidclubresort.com).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Lake Placid. The lake begins just outside the village and is more than 2,000 acres, with islands and bays, creating many miles of shoreline. Most of it is protected, with about 300 lakefront houses, many accessible only by boat. It is the area's most desirable spot, with very few large developments. The luxury resort Whiteface Lodge sits just off the lake and is the area's only fractional real- estate offering, with four-week shares from $55,000 to $225,000 (thewhitefacelodge.com).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Other lakes: Great Camps and more modest homes are popular on many other lakes in the region, including Long Lake, Blue Mountain Lake, Lake Titus and the Saranac Chain of Lakes, 18 miles of interconnected lakes. Adirondack-style lakefront houses begin around $1 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time is fast running out for first-time buyers hoping to get a tax credit of up to $8,000, and Realtors say they're seeing a marked upswing in interest as the deadline looms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate groups also are urging Congress to extend the credit beyond its current deadline and expand the tax credit to up to $15,000. Now, buyers must close on their purchase by Nov. 30 to be eligible for the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders and real estate organizations are concerned that letting the tax credit expire could knock the wind out of the current housing recovery. And failing to expand the credit could imperil efforts to get more move-up buyers into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now, the recovery is in the first stage and getting entry- level buyers in, but it's having no impact on the move-up buyer," says Richard Smith, CEO of <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>, the parent company of Century 21, Coldwell Banker and others. "If we can expand the credit to go after that move-up buyer, we'll be home free."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit available to first-time home buyers is already linked with an uptick in sales. For the first time in five years, existing home sales have increased for four months in a row, according to an August report by the National Association of Realtors (NAR).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 7.2% in July from June, and pending sales are 5% above the pace seen in July of 2008</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those using the tax credit, however, are buying up foreclosed homes that are vacant. That does little to stimulate sales by homeowners looking to move up to more expensive properties. Getting more move-up buyers into the market is considered the second stage of the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even though the tax credit doesn't expire until Nov. 30, today's home purchases take 45-60 days to close as the underwriting and appraisal process is taking longer because lenders are being more cautious. That means offers that will benefit from the tax credit really need to be in this or early next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers have more of a sense of urgency," says Tony Middleton, a Realtor in Los Angeles with ZipRealty, of the expiring tax credit. "They're serious about shopping for a home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is legislation in both the Senate and the House that would expand the tax credit. A proposal by Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., would raise the credit amount to a maximum of $15,000 for any buyer of any home over the next year. It would remove the income caps that currently apply (those limits are now $75,000 for an individual and $150,000 on couples).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we've got a realistic chance of doing this," Isakson says. "Our problem is not with the first-time home buyer, it's the move-up buyer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR, says extending or raising the tax credit would spur the housing recovery, which in turn would help bolster the economy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- Even as a mammoth wildfire still burns in the San Gabriel Mountains, California hasn't seen this year the level of destruction that flames delivered the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could change soon however, fire officials say. A prolonged drought that is drying up vegetation and fueling a seemingly endless fire that has burned more than 250 square miles of Los Angeles County could be the start of a fall siege in Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've had extreme fire behavior: 2007 and 2008 were what firefighters refer to as 'siege years,' " says Janet Upton, deputy director for communications for the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as CalFire. "We're certainly hoping we're not entering a third siege year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California is in the third year of a drought that has contributed to extreme fire conditions. Fire officials say the lack of rain makes brush burn more easily. And when fire hits parched forests, the fire tends to burn faster and do more damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can have a fire go through the same area, and the damage to a forest is always more significant in drought years," says Del Walters, director of CalFire. Trees and logs burn hotter and more completely in droughts, he said, and their heat kills nearby trees that might otherwise survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential for a busy year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the drought, there's plenty of available water to fight most fires, but pilots of firefighting helicopters and tankers may have to fly farther and work harder to fill their buckets. Firefighters are told to be careful to spread out their collection sources so they don't dry out water holes that farmers and ranchers depend on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not down to the point where we're scraping the bottom of the barrel, but we're trying to be good neighbors and not wipe anybody out," says Bill Payne, chief of aviation for CalFire. "They have to go a little farther for a good bucket of water. ... We try really hard not to impact one guy over another."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And firefighters can use any available water -- from the Pacific Ocean to backyard swimming pools, as well as lakes, ponds and streams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wildfires are common to the American West and indeed are -- to an extent -- part of a natural cycle. But fire officials say California, which has millions of people living on the boundaries between cities and wild lands, has seen a striking number of large, destructive fires in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fire still burning in the San Gabriel Mountains northwest of Los Angeles has grown so large it is now the 10th biggest, in terms of acreage burned, since the state began keeping records in 1932. Of the 10 largest recorded fires in California, five of them occurred in 2007, 2008 or this year, according to CalFire statistics. And only three were prior to the start of this decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are in the third year of a drought, and there is all the potential to have another busy year with above-normal fire activity," says Jason Kirchner, spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The human factor</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Humans cause nearly 95% of the fires in California, Walters said. The U.S. Forest Service says arson is the cause of the latest big fire, which started along the Angeles Crest Highway, the twisting route from the city into the high wilderness. Elevations exceed 7,000 feet in spots, and it is popular with car and motorcycle enthusiasts, as well as sightseers and hikers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An October 2003 fire that burned more than 273,000 acres of San Diego County, killing 15 people and destroying 2,820 homes and other structures was the state's most destructive. The October 2007 fire in San Diego County burned almost 198,000 acres and 1,650 homes and structures, killing two people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June 2008, a fire in Siskiyou County in Northern California killed two people and destroyed 192,000 acres. The biggest in the 20th century burned 220,000 acres of Ventura County in 1932.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walters said the season begins in Northern California and moves southward as the year progresses, as brush dries out in the summer heat and fall brings the dry desert winds called Santa Anas, which can quickly turn a spark into a fast-moving inferno.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walters, the state fire chief, says efforts have been successful this year in containing fires overall. This year there have been 6,131 fires on private lands in the state, about 1,600 more than at this point last year. The acreage burned is far less: 123,554 acres compared with 355,392 during the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Western wildfires burn federal land. The Forest Service counts 1,262 fires on federal lands in California this year, burning more than 271,000 acres and most of that is the one fire still burning. At this point in 2008, there had been slightly fewer fires on federal land in California, 1,194, but they had burned 829,200 acres.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current housing market, Lexington, Ky., proves that boring is good. Recent home sales and prices there don't stand out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, Lexington's sales were up 3% over a year ago, slightly below the national average and much lower than cities such as Miami, where sales climbed 64%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lexington, in the heart of Kentucky's bluegrass region, may not have benefited from the housing boom, but it also hasn't seen its housing market come spiraling down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the years, its housing market has remained stable, says Gale Fulton, president of the Lexington-Bluegrass Association of Realtors. While most parts of the country saw home values increase from 10% to 60%, it has seen them hold steady at about 3%, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Lexington has not had a surge in home foreclosures. "Housing remains fairly affordable, so it is possible for the typical person to purchase a home without exotic financing that they needed to do in places like Las Vegas or Miami," says Ken Troske, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Kentucky. "And local banks tend to be more conservative."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lexington, which is in Fayette County, also has not been as hard hit by the recession as other cities that are more heavily dependent on manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known for rolling hills and horse farms, Lexington is home to the University of Kentucky and the headquarters of <span class="companylink">Lexmark</span>. It is also close to Toyota's largest U.S. manufacturing facility, and it has a large and growing health care industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The unemployment rate has gone up in Lexington, but it has not been as high as other parts of the state," says Troske. And there have not been many job furloughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales are up a bit, and home inventory has come down. Many first- time home buyers are taking advantage of the federal $8,000 tax credit, which is allowing home sellers to move up in the market, Fulton says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now, people are feeling a bit more confident and are making decisions," she says. "We're optimistic that next year will be even better."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Try Before You Buy!" is a marketing technique more associated with infomercials than luxury real estate. But in this economic climate, developers of high-end residential communities are getting creative with "test drives" that give prospective buyers a taste of the lifestyle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buying a second home is a big decision, especially in this economic downturn," says St. John Fisher College professor Kyle F. Reinson, a real estate specialist and consultant for residential developers. "Many buyers want to consider quality-of-life issues and even driving distances in addition to cost."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such test drives allow people to stay in a comparable home, play golf and use dining facilities, the spa and other amenities -- usually for a reduced fee. It also usually means a mandatory real estate tour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many developments let serious shoppers play a round of golf or eat dinner in the past, but test drives are now presented as formalized multi-night vacation packages. Even some of the USA's most prestigious private golf communities, such as Colleton River, S.C., and Hualalai, Hawaii, are participating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides giving prospective buyers firsthand knowledge, test drives can actually get buyers the best price, Reinson says, because salespeople do not want to lose interested customers. Even residence clubs, alternatives to traditional second-home ownership that sell shares in multiple vacation homes, are using the concept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Encanterra in Queen Creek, Ariz., a "Taste of Trilogy" four- day all-inclusive package costs $299 per couple during the week. Twenty percent to 25% of such visits result in sales, says Shauna Farmer, director of marketing for <span class="companylink">Shea Homes</span> at Encanterra.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are being very cautious before they make any financial commitments," says Jeff Teich, Encanterra's general manager. "We thought this would be a great way to let them experience the club just as a true member would."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FORT LAUDERDALE -- Cruise up coastal highway A1A. Take in the sea breeze, the sand and surf shimmering in the sun, the palm trees swaying beside luxury high-rise hotels, shops and cafes. The idyllic image helps explain why millions have come to Florida to play, and millions have come back to stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drive a few blocks inland -- past fading strip malls and fast- food joints -- and a jolting new reality emerges. The parking lot of a career counseling center along Oakland Park Boulevard is jammed. There aren't enough counselors to advise hundreds of jobless people who come through the doors every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession has dealt a whopping blow to the fourth-most- populous state. Unemployment is soaring. Florida is second to California in foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month came the most jaw-dropping announcement of all: The state that made population growth the linchpin of its economy for more than 60 years lost a net 58,000 people this year, according to newly released estimates for April 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the end of an era," says Robert Lang, director of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech. "Florida represents an entire postwar vision of the good life -- palm trees, low cost and no taxes, just easy living. They could turn it around, but in the short haul, it's paradise lost."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida isn't attracting retirees at nearly the rate it used to. Nor is it drawing young people the way it once did because jobs have dried up. The state's twin economic engines -- tourism and construction -- are sputtering. Now, Florida's leaders are pushing hard to develop industries that will create high-paying jobs in fields such as alternative energy and bioscience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The time is long past when Florida's economy can be based on waiting at the Welcome Center with a glass of free orange juice and a real estate map," says state Sen. Don Gaetz, a Republican. "We have to do far better than that. ... We are learning a great deal from the difficulties we're undergoing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A place in the sun</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession has had a measurable impact on the traditionally mobile USA by forcing more Americans to stay put because they can't sell their homes or find new jobs. Its outsized effect on this dynamic Sun Belt state of 18.3 million is reshaping migration and settlement patterns across the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also could help redraw the electoral map once congressional seats are reapportioned after the 2010 Census. Now that Florida's population is shrinking, the state is unlikely to win another seat in Congress and some other states may be less likely to lose one, according to standard reapportionment formulas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida has been a magnet for so long that when it stops drawing people, demographic ripples are felt elsewhere. "It affects us because people aren't moving there from somewhere else," Lang says. "New Jersey stays bigger. Pennsylvania stays bigger. New York stays bigger."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than a half-century, Florida had been the dream destination for millions of Americans. Affordable housing in a fast- growing state, no state income tax, a sunny climate and the advent of air conditioning attracted a steady stream of retirees, sun- seekers and fortune hunters. Now, not so much:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Growth has stalled. For the first time since the end of World War II, when hundreds of thousands of military personnel stationed in Florida went home, the state lost population in the past year, according to the University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research. For the first time since Florida became a state in 1845, more people are moving out of the state than in, according to Census numbers and moving company reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of migrants from the Northeast -- traditionally Florida's largest source of newcomers -- has dropped almost in half since its peak five years ago as the state's allure faded. Florida, once the fifth cheapest state to live in, now is the 14th most expensive, according to Mark Wilson, president and CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Jobs are disappearing. Unemployment jumped to 10.7% in July from 6.3% a year ago, well above the national rate of 9.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If thousands of working-age adults hadn't abandoned the state, "our unemployment rate would've been higher," says John Hall, executive director of the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, an independent research group. "We're a state in trouble," Hall says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*The housing market has collapsed. Twelve percent of mortgages were in foreclosure during the second quarter of this year, the highest rate in the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Florida continues to establish itself as the worst state in the union for mortgage performance," says Jay Brinkmann, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Pensacola to Key West 850 miles away, the recession has rudely awakened a state that has flourished on a relentless influx of tourists, sun-seekers and retirees and the lower-paid service economy that supports them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Florida has been turned on its head," says Brookings Institution demographer William Frey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A statewide strategy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vastly different in geography, climate, culture and economic interests, Florida's distinctive regions -- north Florida, central Florida and South Florida -- historically have found it difficult to share one vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Population growth, however, was one constant they all enjoyed. Now that it's gone, the mini-states have joined forces to try to create new economies and reduce their dependence on growth alone. It's something other booming states that are now hurting -- notably Arizona and Nevada -- are learning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Multiple regions around the country worked off the business of growth, and they're all suffering," Lang says. "Don't put all your eggs in one basket."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida has set up public and private partnerships to lead efforts on workforce training, tourism and economic development. The Senate Select Committee on Florida's Economy, a bipartisan effort launched in February, has pushed to streamline regulations and cut the cost of doing business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can't get out of this recession ... by fixing a problem in Miami or Orlando," says Gaetz, who heads the committee. "We have to have a state economic policy, develop a workforce."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the state's most controversial actions, signed into law by Republican Gov. Charlie Crist in June: Rewrite Florida's 25-year- old growth restrictions by lifting a state mandate that required developers in more urban areas to pay for new roads. It's a move opposed by environmental groups such as 1000 Friends of Florida. Local communities now will decide whether to charge such fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The overarching economic policy of growth management was approved when Florida was bursting at the seams," Gaetz says. "Economic policy ought to be tied to economic reality."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state also is pushing for:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Improved education. The Quality Counts report by Education Week, a national journal published by a non-profit group, ranked Florida in six key areas of K-12 education. It was 31st in 2006, 14th in 2007 and 10th this year. Its overall grade jumped from C+ to B-.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state two years ago began requiring school districts to create at least one career academy that focuses on one field such as health sciences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a career pathway," says Loretta Costin, vice chancellor for Career and Adult Education. "It helps high school students become actively engaged."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the WorkForce One center here, one of 24 regional operations run by the state and private interests, some of the jobless who come for help are taught how to draft resumes and apply for work online. Others are enrolled in local schools to retrain for jobs of the future: technology, health care, engineering and all things "green."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angelo de Santis, 25, has an associate degree in business administration from Miami Dade College. That worked well until he was laid off in February as an information technology analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through WorkForce One, he will take computer classes to earn an advanced certification. "The mentality of people in this state is going to have to shift," de Santis says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Alternative energy. Eric Silagy, vice president of Florida Power &amp; Light, the state's largest energy supplier, says, "We're building three solar plants right now. It will take Florida from not even being on the solar map to being the second-largest producer in the nation (after California)." By the end of next year, the plants will produce 110 megawatts of electricity, enough for 35,000 homes and businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*High tech, medical and bioscience. A "high-tech corridor" stretching along Interstate 4 from Tampa to Orlando is anchored by the University of Central Florida in Orlando and the University of South Florida in Tampa and St. Petersburg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area also is home to cancer research centers, bio-medical engineering companies and oceanographic centers. Among them: California-based Burnham Institute for Medical Research, which chose Orlando for its East Coast expansion; <span class="companylink">SRI International</span> set up a facility in St. Petersburg that will research environmental health and security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Atlantic coast, the Scripps Research Institute and Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies -- both based in San Diego -- set up shop in Jupiter and Port St. Lucie, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing rebound?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding an upside to the real estate market is difficult when "For Sale" signs sprout in every third or fourth front yard on some streets of upscale neighborhoods here. Like many other states, however, Florida is seeing some heartening signs after the housing market collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a peak in 2006 of $248,300, the median price of existing, single-family homes -- where half cost more and half less -- has fallen 41% to $147,600 in July. That has triggered a surge in home buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're experiencing a tremendous amount of transactions, up 35% year over year for the first six months, and it's being driven by first-time homebuyers," says Rei Mesa, president of Prudential Florida Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the precipitous price drop, many economists expect Florida housing values to remain higher than those in the rest of the Southeast. That may entice retirees and families to move from northern states to Georgia or North Carolina instead of Florida, says University of Florida economist David Denslow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, some Floridians such as Linden and Nancy Anderson are leaving. The Andersons moved to South Florida from New York in 1985 seeking a safer place for their teenage son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we used to come down here on vacation, I liked what I saw," says Linden, now 69, who worked as a ramp serviceman for now- defunct Eastern Airlines and later as a shuttle bus driver for Hertz. They bought a house in Kendall, 20 miles south of Miami, when prices were low but later bought a larger home when prices were rising rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He hasn't worked since heart surgery. Nancy, 68, has gone back to work part time as a dental assistant. She complains that Florida wages are low while the cost of living is high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're ready to move to Georgia to be close to their son and 4- year-old grandson, but they can't sell their house. Its value has already dropped $100,000 to about $260,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Says Nancy: "I'm stuck."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower relative unemployment, fewer subprime loans and stable public-sector jobs are helping steady the housing market in the city of San Luis Obispo, Calif., even though home prices continue sliding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, sales were up 8.7% compared with a year earlier, while prices in the city between San Francisco and Los Angeles fell 15%. Home prices tumbled more in other parts of the state, including 29% in Monterey County and 22.7% in Santa Barbara County in July, by comparison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city of San Luis Obispo has not been hard hit by home foreclosure and short sales, largely because it has many high-end properties that were not financed by subprime loans, says Mark Schniepp, director of the California Economic Forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some areas of San Luis Obispo County, such as Paso Robles and Arroyo Grande, have experienced homeowner distress, he says. But the dire economic woes have been blunted in the city of San Luis Obispo, Schniepp says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a lot of public-sector employment here," he says. "Up until this point, it has not been impacted much by the economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city, locally known as SLO, is home to California Polytechnic State University, Camp San Luis Obispo -- a California National Guard training site -- and California Men's Colony, a male-only state prison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the state is tightening its budget, local unemployment may rise. But that's still a big question mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the job market hits a snag, the local housing market may hold steady. The wine industry is growing, and beaches and wineries are tourism magnets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our county has been in much better shape compared to others" in terms of unemployment, says Ron Burkhart, president of the San Luis Obispo Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Luis Obispo also attracts many retirees who want to buy homes near Morro Bay, which is about 14 miles from the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even though home sales are not as active as they were five years ago, there is some activity. And we are in much better shape than other areas."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales rose nearly 10% in July, according to a government report Wednesday that bolstered signs of an improving housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 433,000, the highest pace since last September, the government said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a 9.6% increase over the revised rate for June -- better than industry analysts had expected, but still 13.4% below the July 2008 rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales rate has risen 31.6% from this year's lowest rate, which was set in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of July was 271,000, according to the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That represents a supply of 7.5 months at the current sales rate, the lowest figure since April 2007 and well below January's supply of 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's really good news. Inventory is down; sales are up," says Patrick Newport, with IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question, Newport says, is how much of a lift sales are getting from a federal tax credit of up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers. It expires Nov. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's report on new home sales follows Tuesday's S&amp;P/ Case-Shiller Index report showing improving home prices in June compared with May in 18 of 20 cities tracked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the government, the median sales price of new houses sold in July was $210,100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm optimistic," says Tim Dwyer, CEO of Entitle Direct Group, a title insurer in Stamford, Conn. "What was needed was a bottoming. Then consumers would start to look left and right and start jumping. I believe that's what's happening here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Northeast, July's sales rate rose 32.4% compared with June, the strongest gain of any region. The South was up 16.2%; the West was up 1%; and the Midwest's sales rate fell 7.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Naroff, of Naroff Economic Advisors, said the rise in existing home sales is a tangible sign that the housing market is now back up and running.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's in part because builders are being more cautious about pursuing developments until they are certain they can sell their properties, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can stop worrying about the housing market and start playing closer attention to other issues, such as when credit will start flowing more freely," Naroff said in a statement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oakland County in Michigan is a county of contrasts: It is near Detroit, and its county seat is Pontiac, a depressed, blue-collar city. But it's also home to affluent areas such as Birmingham and Farmington Hills, and because of them, it ranks among the nation's wealthiest counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pontiac is still losing jobs because GM assembly plants are closing, yet it is one part of the county where home sales are picking up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are some great deals in Pontiac," says Amy Albright, president of the North Oakland County Board of Realtors. "The prices up to $150,000 are booming."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers are snapping up lower-price homes and taking advantage of a one-time federal $8,000 tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It makes homeownership cheaper than renting a home in some areas," says Don Grimes, senior research specialist at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, home sales in the county rose 20.1% from a year ago, but home prices continued to drop sharply. Median prices were down 25.9% compared with July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low-price homes are now getting multiple offers and selling for more than the asking price, Albright says. But high-price homes are on the market much longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a lot more difficult, because there is a smaller pool of buyers in the higher-priced range now," Albright says. In the past, many of the buyers were auto executives. Now, many of them are losing their jobs and leaving the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the county has been feeling the brunt of the auto industry's collapse, it is in better shape than many other parts of the state. "Its unemployment rate is worse than the nation, but it's not as bad as Michigan overall," Grimes says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is because its local economy is more diverse than other parts of the state. It has less dependence on auto-parts producers, Grimes says. And its employers include the health care, information technology and finance industries, which attract white-collar jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if jobs improve, it's unclear if the housing market will see prices turn around any time soon. The bank-owned properties and short sales are good news for buyers but not for sellers. All home values are dragged down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unfortunately, I think we will have another year of home foreclosure," Albright says. "But the market has to start somewhere, and hopefully, the positive signs will cause prices to work their way up."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction ran 8/26/2009: A story Friday on Atlantic City real estate incorrectly included Ocean Club and Tannen Towers as recent condo projects. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before World War II, Atlantic City was one of the nation's most popular oceanfront resorts, on par with Miami Beach. When its fortunes declined, the city became the first U.S. locale outside Nevada to allow casinos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original Atlantic City casinos were self-contained and did little to revive their surroundings. But now, development has spread across downtown with two new retail and dining complexes: the Walk near the convention center and the 300,000-square-foot Pier Shops at Caesars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the city's suddenly hot south end, four casino resorts are under construction, along with Bella, a new residential high-rise condo building. Other recent condo projects include the Ocean Club, Tannen Towers and a conversion of the old <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> hotel. Studios can be had in the low $100,000s, but most new condos start at $200,000 to $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent developments include two non-gaming hotels, The Chelsea and The Water Club at the Borgata Hotel, Casino &amp; Spa, reflecting the city's new objective to be a dining and entertainment destination. The latest major improvement was the launch in February of the Atlantic City Express Service (ACES) train, a direct connection to Newark Airport and New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantic City occupies the north end of Absecon Island, which also includes the villages of Margate, Ventnor and Longport. It's just a 20-minute drive from one end to the other, and most second homes offer attractions within walking distance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside downtown, homes are large for a resort town. "It's the last frontier of the Northeast where you can still buy affordable vacation homes on the beach or a block away. Most second-home owners spend $300,000 to $700,000," says real estate agent Mark Arbeit of Prudential Fox &amp; Roach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arbeit cites the location -- an hour from Philadelphia, two from New York -- as a major draw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New Yorkers are sick of traveling all the way to the Hamptons and spending millions for beach homes," Arbeit says. "There is world- class entertainment (here), thanks to the casinos, restaurants, spas, nightclubs. It's affordable, and almost everything on the island is close to the beach."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at three Absecon Island neighborhoods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Atlantic City: For second-home owners, the place to be is the south end of the city, especially the Lower Chelsea neighborhood, says Realtor Mark Arbeit. "It's the most residential, (with) estates and large beach homes. As you go north, it becomes much denser and more of a commercial city." New condos begin at about $235,000; four- bedroom houses are around $370,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Ventnor: Just south of Atlantic City, Ventnor also has a boardwalk. Here, it extends from the main casino and entertainment strip. "The island is narrower here, just three blocks from beach to bay, so everything is close to the water," Arbeit says. Older condos can be found for around $200,000, new luxury townhouse condos start at about $450,000, and single-family houses begin around $300,000. The most desirable section is St. Leonard's Tract, nine blocks of grand homes on large lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Margate/Longport: While Ventnor is an extension of Atlantic City, Margate has its own town center with restaurants and shops. Prices run just a bit higher than in Ventnor, Arbeit says. On the island's southern end, Longport is residential and the most expensive. Almost all homes are on the beach or bay, and there are few condos. Single-family houses begin at $800,000, but many are in the $2 million-$3 million range.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial real estate downturn is deepening, threatening to slow the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To try to contain the damage, the Federal Reserve said Monday that it will extend into 2010 a program to help investors buy commercial property loans. But some say that will have limited impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We seem to be nearing the end of the recession but the situation in the commercial real estate market is getting worse," says Patrick Newport, an analyst at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About $83 billion of office, retail, industrial and apartment properties have fallen into default, foreclosure or bankruptcy this year, says research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. The default rate for commercial mortgages jumped from 1.62% to 2.25% in the first quarter and should hit 4.1% by the end of the year, says Sam Chandan, president of Real Estate Econometrics. The carnage will likely cut half a percentage point off economic growth this year and in 2010, Newport says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fueled by easy credit, developers built too many shopping malls and office buildings from 2004 to 2007. As the economy soured, vacancy rates rose. Property values are down about 40% from their 2007 peak, Deutsch Bank says, and loans for commercial properties have come to a virtual standstill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of smaller regional banks, which are heavily exposed to commercial mortgages, could go bankrupt the next two years, Newport says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unwilling to seize devalued properties in a moribund market, lenders have foreclosed on fewer than 10% of the loans, says <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. That's prolonging the crisis by keeping properties from being resold at lower prices, says New York real estate lawyer Edward Mermelstein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bigger problem: the nearly $1 trillion in short-term commercial mortgages slated to mature by the end of 2010. With property owners unable to refinance, even solid loans could go into default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To ease that crunch, the Federal Reserve is extending a program to lend investors up to $200 billion to buy assets backed by commercial mortgages and consumer loans. The program, which has lent just $29.6 billion, was to expire by year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initiative should establish realistic asset prices, reviving the market, says Jeffrey DeBoer, CEO of the Real Estate Roundtable, which represents property owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chandan is skeptical, saying banks are moving away from commercial real estate loans to diversify.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rose in most of the country in the second quarter compared with the first, a trend driven by falling prices, lower interest rates, and a tax credit for first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales increase is viewed as a positive sign that the struggling housing market is showing more signs of stabilization, even though foreclosures continue to escalate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales rose 3.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.76 million units in the second quarter from 4.58 million units in the first quarter, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). That is still 2.9% below the second quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing a growing percentage of metropolitan areas (with home sales) up over the year, which is impressive," says Joel Naroff, with Naroff Economic Advisors. "We're seeing growing strength in a variety of areas across the country."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But foreclosures are rising, and that's pulling down home prices. Foreclosure filings were reported on 360,149 properties in July, according to a RealtyTrac report today. That's an increase of nearly 7% from the previous month and a jump of 32% from July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty-nine states saw sales increases from the first quarter, and sales in nine states were higher than a year ago. Washington, D.C., showed both quarterly and annual rises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Double-digit gains in sales between the first and second quarters were seen in Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, Washington, Hawaii, New York, New Jersey, Maine, Vermont, Wisconsin, Indiana, South Dakota and Montana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This data suggests that the recovery is broadening," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist with NAR. "Low interest rates and the tax credit (for first-time home buyers) are beginning to pull buyers back into the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices on existing homes are continuing to fall. The national median price for single-family homes was $174,100 in the quarter, which is 15.6% lower than during the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest sales gain between the first and second quarters was in Idaho, up 67.5%, followed by Hawaii, up 24.2%. New York was up 22.3% and Wisconsin's sales rose 21.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's important to see the growth because of the volume (of homes) out there," says Pat Lashinsky, CEO of ZipRealty. "We're seeing inventory come down and the market come back into equilibrium."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- In the latest sign that the battered housing market is healing, sales of new homes in June jumped a bigger-than- expected 11% from May, and the inventory of new homes for sale continued to shrink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes, driven largely by lower prices and mortgage rates, sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 384,000 units last month, vs. 346,000 in May. It was the third month in a row of higher sales and the most robust sales pace since November 2008, which had an annual sales rate of 390,000 new homes, according to figures released Monday by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps more important, the months supply of homes for sale fell to 8.8 months in June, down from 10.2 in May and the lowest monthly supply since October 2007. Housing experts said that is a sign that the inventory overhang that has put downward pressure on prices is abating somewhat. The "months supply" inventory yardstick is the amount of time it would take to sell the 281,000 unsold new homes now on the market at current sales rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While median new home prices continued to fall last month, dipping 12% from a year ago to $206,200, and are unlikely to stop falling until late in 2009 at the earliest, market watchers were upbeat about the drop in inventories of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are finally working through this excess inventory," says Randall Guttery, professor of real estate at the University of North Texas. "Once we get that excess inventory taken off the market, we can get back to a more healthy supply-and-demand-driven market." A supply of six to seven months of new homes for sale is deemed a healthy balance between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales got a boost from a government program that offers a federal tax credit up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers that close before the end of November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend toward better housing data has raised hopes that the worst of the slump is finally over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Evidence is mounting that we have turned the corner for sales, and that is a precursor for a recovery," says Bernard Markstein, senior economist at the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite recent signs of stabilization, the housing market still faces obstacles, says Andres Carbacho-Burgos, economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "The housing recovery is tied to the ongoing recession and job market and depends on the health of the banking system," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rose for the third-consecutive month in June, a promising sign that stability in the housing market could help jump- start the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales last month rose 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.89 million properties with gains seen in all major regions of the USA, according to a Thursday report by the National Association of Realtors (NAR).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But overall home prices continued to slide. The median price on existing homes in June was $181,800, down 15.4% from June 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The numbers are encouraging and show some stability," says Bernard Baumohl at the Economic Outlook Group. "Given that the economic crisis all began with the collapse in the housing market, it's encouraging to see this sector starting to improve."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes for sale also dropped, meaning there is less of a glut on the market. Total housing inventory in June represented a 9.4-month supply at the current sales rate, down from 9.8 months in May. Compared with a year ago, the number of homes on the market is down 15%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke also said recently that the housing crisis seemed to be moderating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are being dragged down by the large number of distressed homes for sale. Distressed sales -- which include sales of foreclosed homes -- accounted for about a third of sales in the second quarter. About 30% of sales in June were distressed sales, down from about 50% through March of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers in June accounted for 29% of transactions, unchanged from May, according to a separate survey by NAR. Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight, says that it's too soon to say the market for homes is turning around. The economy is still shedding jobs, credit is tight, and a tax credit of up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers that has boosted sales will expire at the end of November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates also are inching up. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.20% for the week ended July 23, up from last week when it averaged 5.14%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sales will sag until the labor market turns around. This will not happen until next year," Newport said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And foreclosures are continuing to mount. June marked the fourth- consecutive month that foreclosure filings surpassed 300,000, according to RealtyTrac. A total of 1.9 million foreclosure filings were reported in the first half of this year, up 15% from the first six months of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Thursday, the Federal Reserve proposed changes in mortgage broker commissions. The changes would no longer let brokers earn greater compensation when offering pricier loans.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in many Middle America suburbs, the pace of development in Lee's Summit, Mo. -- 16 miles outside Kansas City -- has slowed dramatically after a decade of growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had a major, major boom," says Realtor Diana Frank of <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span>. "We couldn't build (houses) fast enough."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's no longer the case in Missouri's sixth-largest city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Maybe we have been building too much," concedes Heping Zhan, manager of long-range planning for the city's Planning and Development Department. "With the recent economy and housing crisis, new construction has dropped significantly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May sales of existing single-family homes fell 40% from a year ago, while construction of new homes dawdles in the white-collar suburb. Foreclosures and short sales also are becoming more common, Frank says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lee's Summit currently has 87 foreclosures, according to RealtyTrac.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And prices have been reduced, an average 7% off the original asking price, on 23% of 892 non-foreclosure homes on the market, reports Trulia.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There has been an increase in vacant homes, so choices are many," Zhan says, "especially for a first-time home buyer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The western Missouri suburb typically draws a higher-income home buyer because there is no mass transit, Frank says. Lee's Summit's median household income in 2007 ($72,283) was nearly double the average in Kansas City and well above the state average ($45,012), but only 25% of its residents work inside the city limits, according to the Lee's Summit Economic Development Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local economy, driven by the Lee's Summit school system and medical centers, is strengthening, Zhan says, but many workers still commute to Kansas City and other parts of the metro area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ranked 79th in CNN Money's 100 Best Places to Live in 2008, Lee's Summit attracts many families with its schools (rated seventh in the country on CNN's list) and nearby lakes, says Frank, who moved there 15 years ago for those reasons. "I think (the housing market) will slowly come back," she says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The government will allow more distressed borrowers who owe more than their homes are worth to be eligible for refinancing assistance under an Obama administration housing rescue program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, homeowners who owe 5% more than their homes are worth can refinance mortgages through <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, part of a two-pronged approach to reduce the rapid-fire pace of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan said the program will be expanded, allowing homeowners who owe 25% more than their homes are worth on the market to get refinancing help through the federal agencies. Owing more on a home than it's worth is referred to as being "underwater."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's great. It's good news," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the National Association of Realtors. "Many homes are way deeper underwater. This means more people can tap into those lower rates. It will enlarge the number of people who can get help."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other economists questioned how much of a boost it will give toward staving off foreclosures, which have risen about 18% from May 2008, according to a report last month by RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if more homeowners are eligible for refinancing under the Obama plan, rising interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages are still expected to dampen refinancing activity. For many owners, it no longer makes financial sense to refinance. The average rate on a 30- year fixed loan is 5.42% as of June 25, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That's up from 4.82% on May 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a little help, but not a huge deal," says Mark Zandi, an economist with <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "We need new fixed rates that are south of 5%. At the current rate, it doesn't make a lot of sense to refinance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refinancing activity has already dropped off as rates have risen. The refinancing share of mortgage activity decreased to 46.4% of total applications from 54% the previous week, according to a report Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association. The MBA's refinance index, which measures refinancing activity, is at its lowest since November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 15 million homeowners in the USA currently owe more than their homes are worth on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other housing news Wednesday, NAR reported that an index measuring pending home sales rose 6.7% compared with May 2008 -- the first time the index has risen four months in a row since October 2004 and a sign of some possible stabilization in the housing market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nationwide plunge in luxury home sales did not exempt Newport, R.I., but vacation-home seekers are beginning to come out of hiding in the seaside community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market went silent in October," says Melanie Delman of Lila Delman Real Estate. "But since April, we've experienced a change. We're busy every day with showings, discussions and negotiations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delman, whose company sells many of the multimillion-dollar homes in the area, believes the luxury market may finally be emerging from a lengthy drought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown, a high-end second-home community in Newport County, has seen a 66% drop in single-family home sales from a year ago, according to the Rhode Island Multiple Listing Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the wobbly luxury market, April sales of median-price homes in the county actually topped last year's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtor Chad Kritzas, who specializes in selling moderate homes in Newport, says he has experienced the normal cyclical market and is coming off a great spring. "Things will slow down a little bit until school starts in August, but we will pick right back up again in September," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems the luxury market, not the median market, has absorbed the brunt of the recession. The low sales are a clear reflection of a writhing Wall Street, says Bellevue Realtors President Vincent Marcello.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The luxury buyers are not here in the numbers they used to be," Marcello says. "Most lost money or are afraid of losing money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delman does not look at sales numbers too closely, though, as her company does not operate in a "volume market." She views now as a perfect time to buy; it could be years before Newport sees a return to the caliber of homes currently on the market at such reduced prices, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lined with plush mansions along a quaint, waterfront setting, Newport County appeals to many a luxury house hunter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linda Purdy, a retiree from Hobe Sound, Fla., recently chose to buy a vacation home in Newport over popular Northeastern equivalents such as Nantucket and the Hamptons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After some serious scrutiny of Northeastern seaside towns, we settled on Newport for its easy access, Gilded Age history, culture and its great value relative to other waterfront communities," Purdy said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts shot up 17.2% in May compared with April in a sign that construction of single-family homes has begun a modest turnaround that could bolster an economic recovery by year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of homes and apartments rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 532,000 in May after hitting an all-time low in April, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That soundly beat analysts' estimates of 485,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building-permit applications increased 4% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 518,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most significant was a 7.5% increase in single-family starts to an annualized rate of 401,000, the highest since November. That's still low by historical standards. But home starts have risen steadily since bottoming in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's really hard for someone to sell a new home," says Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight. "You're competing in markets where foreclosed homes are selling at fire-sale prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, housing investment should start contributing positively to the nation's gross domestic product by the fourth quarter, Newport says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the May increase in new residential building stemmed from a 62% jump in multifamily starts to 131,000. However, construction of apartments and condominiums reached a record low of 81,000 in April, and May's totals are still well below levels of two months ago. Also, multifamily totals swing wildly and don't reflect a severe slump in that segment, Newport says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily building permits, a more reliable indicator, fell 8.3%, the 11th monthly decline in a row. Construction of apartments and condos has been hampered by a credit crisis that has prevented builders from obtaining financing. <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> senior economist Mark Vitner also points to "widespread overbuilding of condominiums and town homes and rising vacancy rates for rental apartments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family-home permits, however, rose 7.9% to a rate of 408,000. Permit totals exceeding starts indicates starts should continue to move upward in coming months. "That's what gives us confidence that a bottom has been reached," Vitner says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economic news Tuesday was less heartening. Industrial production declined a larger-than-expected 1.1% in May, with manufacturing output falling 1%, the Federal Reserve said. Production of motor vehicles plunged 7.9%; consumer goods, 0.8%; construction supply output, 1%; and business equipment, 1.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, producer prices edged up 0.2% in May as surging gasoline prices offset a drop in food prices, the Labor Department said. Core producer prices, excluding food and energy prices, fell 0.1%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are finally showing some signs of life in Orlando. In April, sales were up 38% compared with the same month in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are climbing back up," says Les Simmonds, president of the Orlando Regional Realtor Association. "And we're encouraged by that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Orlando market has been in a free fall since the housing bubble burst in 2006. Even though sales have perked up, home prices are still dropping, and sales in the condominium market remain quite soft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the housing market may not yet have hit bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not ready to wave the 'bottom' flag until I start to see some stabilization in prices," says Sean Snaith, director of the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unclear how soon that will happen, because Orlando, home to <span class="companylink">Walt Disney World Resort</span>, is still seeing short sales and foreclosures, which drag prices down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subprime loans were the original cause of the housing meltdown, but now job losses are making it hard for many homeowners to keep up with mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The whole housing hangover is pretty bad in Florida, and Orlando is no exception," Snaith says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales, bank-owned properties, low mortgage rates and a tax credit have attracted first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A home for $100,000 or less is getting a lot more activity now," says Simmonds. "Sales are increasing, and we are also seeing multiple offers on properties again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orlando has always relied on tourism, which has suffered from the recession. But the medical industry is expanding, easing the economic downturn and creating jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may help prices rise and the housing market come back to life, even though no one knows how soon it will happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're optimistic because the real estate market is cyclical," Simmonds says. "And so we'll be going into an up cycle, but we don't foresee getting back into the craziness that we had before."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Herstein is in a good spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Seattle oncologist has shopped condominiums in eight cities - - including San Diego, Miami and Chicago -- for the past year. He wants a top floor on a building with a water view. He can pay cash. And he's in no rush to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Time is probably on my side," he says. "Sellers will have to become more realistic over the next year or so."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent housing figures indicate Herstein may be right, at least in some markets and in some price ranges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While evidence mounts that the single-family-home market is stabilizing, the condominium market remains "substantially weaker," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, resale condo and co-op sales nationwide were down 9.4% from a year ago vs. a 2.8% drop for single-family homes, the association said Wednesday. Median prices fared worse, too, with condo prices down 18.5% year-over-year vs. 15% for single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More distress is likely for the condo market, says Bradley Hunter, chief economist for market researcher Metrostudy. He says some markets could see condo prices drop 60% from their peak in 2005 or 2006. While some single-family-home markets will hit bottom next year, Hunter doesn't see that for the condo market until 2011. That's because it typically takes years to construct condo projects so new units have continued to come on line despite the real estate downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is absolutely a buyer's market," says Paul Berg, 73, a forensic psychologist who, with his wife, recently paid $1.4 million for a new, 2,000-square-foot condo in downtown San Diego. A year ago, the price was twice as high, Berg says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those on the selling side of the market, the downturn has been intense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Prices for condos in South Florida have plunged 40% to 50%, or more in some buildings, from original prices in 2004, 2005 and 2006, Metrostudy says. Recovery is far off. In Miami-Dade County, which includes downtown Miami, condo inventories are at a 41.5-month supply at the current sales rate, Hunter says. "That's a mammoth number."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Minneapolis-St. Paul, the average sales price per square foot for a condo is about 16% less than it was three years ago, says the Minneapolis Area Association of Realtors. Recent sales activity "has come to a grinding halt," says downtown condo expert Kristen DuLac of Edina Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Austin, buyers at a recent auction got condos for 15% to 20% less than similar units that sold in late 2008, says Rhett Winchell, president of California-based Kennedy Wilson Auction Group. His company has done almost three dozen condo auctions for builders in the last two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional challenges</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same factors dogging single-family-home sales have hurt the condo market, including rising unemployment, stock portfolio losses and tightening credit. The condo market faces additional challenges. For one, single-family-home prices in some markets have dropped so much they're attracting what would have been condo buyers, Winchell says. Condo loans are also tougher to get now than single-family- home loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lenders have greatly tightened restrictions because they see condo properties as a little more risky," Yun says, in part because occupancy rates in buildings can vary a lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To woo buyers, condo developers have been "aggressive with incentives," says Wendy Leung, condo expert at John L. Scott Real Estate in Seattle. A new condo development there, Gallery, is offering buyers incentives such as a credit of 3% of the purchase price toward closing costs, or no homeowner dues until 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are also relying more on rentals. In Las Vegas, the number of rentals in some luxury high-rise condo buildings on or near the Strip has doubled in recent years, says Bruce Hiatt, owner of Luxury Realty Group. "Owners or developers are buying time," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Diego, Mark Mills, Realtor and condo expert for Re/Max Real Estate Consultants, estimates that 50% of the units in his San Diego condo building are owner occupied, down from 75% in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the prospect of more distress ahead for the condo market, some markets show signs of improvement, Realtors say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Seattle had 13% fewer condos for sale than the same month a year earlier. Pending sales were up 1% year over year, Leung says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas' Hiatt says prices have dropped so much that multiple offers are now common. He says he's lost seven deals in recent weeks to multiple offers. "People didn't expect this to happen until next year," he says. "We are firming in price as well as demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Diego County, resale condo prices in April were down 55% from their peak three years earlier, says market researcher MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That big plunge -- and recent rise in sales activity -- is encouraging, says San Diego condo developer Nat Bosa of Bosa Development. In July, it'll reopen sales of the Bayside at Embarcadero condo project after a year of inactivity. "There are many more buyers out there now," Bosa says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers aren't waiting for anyone to call an official bottom. Marianne Rose and her husband bought a Seattle condo in April. They paid $213,500 for a 568-square-foot unit near downtown. A year ago, similar units were selling for at least $240,000, says Rose, a therapist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo gives the family, which includes four daughters ages 11, 15, 18 and 21, an alternative to commuting from their home on nearby Vashon Island. Rose's husband, who works in network communications, works a block from the condo and one daughter attends a nearby high school. The couple expect to own the condo for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're probably crazy, taking a risk in this economy," she says. "But you only know where the bottom is when you look back."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More repeat buyers appear to be buying homes, contributing to a slight uptick in existing-home sales this spring. First-time buyers' share of existing-home sales in April declined to 40% from over half in March, according to the National Association of Realtors. The majority of buyers are now repeat buyers, which includes owner- occupants who are moving up to larger or more expensive homes. Investors make up the rest of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes last month rose 2.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.68 million units from 4.55 million in March, the NAR reported Wednesday. Still, that was 3.5% below April 2008 levels. Home sales are rising in areas that have had a large number of foreclosures, such as California, Nevada and Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity from repeat buyers is important for increasing sales of midprice homes and for clearing out inventory of unsold homes. At the end of April there were 3.97 million existing homes for sale, a 10.2-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with a 9.6- month supply in March. Economists say a six-month supply is healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"During the spring season we see existing-home owners put their homes on the market," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR. "First-time buyers are releasing the existing-home owners, who are then able to sell to make their purchases. It's a chain reaction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market may not yet be drawing large numbers of repeat buyers who are trading up to larger or more expensive homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The move-up buyers aren't there. People are sitting on the sidelines trying to judge the market," says Coldwell Banker CEO Jim Gillespie. "I believe it's more investors."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists say that even with more repeat buyers and a tax credit for first-time home buyers, the housing market's recovery is still faltering because of the economy and job losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sales will continue to drop in the second half of the year, because the economy is losing so many jobs and the GDP (gross domestic product) is still dropping," says Patrick Newport at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median price for existing homes was $170,200 in April, 15.4% below 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of foreclosed properties and others that sold for less than their mortgage balance continue to pull down the median price because they generally sell at discounts. They represented 45% of all existing-home sales in April.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to feel good about a 10.8% drop in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But real estate officials in Salem, Ore., can at least take some solace that house prices there have held up better than the rest of the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic worries have dragged down sales in Salem for sure -- 33.2% lower in March 2009 than the same month a year prior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because Salem is the state capital and the county seat of Marion County, it is insulated from major job losses, which has buffered its housing market a little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have a lot of government employment, and that has been somewhat more stable than employment in other industries," says Ray Burstedt, president of SEDCOR, a non-profit economic development corporation. "Our economy is also very diversified."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salem is home to agricultural producers and food product manufacturers. "They have been working at full capacity, and that also has helped us considerably," Burstedt says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that doesn't mean that workers aren't anxious about their futures. "The economy is causing a lot of apprehension among home buyers," says Don Meyer, president-elect of the Salem Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has other problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of its markets has disappeared. Until the housing market crashed in California, many people who lived there were selling their homes and moving to Salem for less costly but lovely retirement homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When California prices fell, homeowners couldn't cash out of their homes. Salem suddenly had too many high-end retirement homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, many local home buyers are waiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are thinking that everybody is in trouble, and so they are waiting for prices to go down," Meyer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The waiting may be paying off, as more-affordable homes are coming into the market, and starting to sell. High-end homes are not selling, but homes for $200,000 have a lot of activity, Meyer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing industry hopes that sales have finally hit bottom. "We are probably going to bounce along for another month or two, but we are seeing some recovery even now," Burstedt says.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts hit a record low in April, driven by a plunge in new apartment construction while some improvement was seen in the single-family sector, the government said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disappointing numbers indicate that a broad bottoming in the housing market -- despite some recent signs that new home sales have strengthened and builder confidence is up -- remains elusive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction starts of new homes and apartments nationwide fell 12.8% last month from March to an annual rate of 458,000 units, the Commerce Department said. That's down almost 80% from the peak in January 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One glimmer of good news was that permits for single-family home construction edged up 3.6% in April from March, while starts posted a 2.8% gain month to month. Permits lead starts and indicate future construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uptick in single-family activity indicates that "we're hopefully bouncing along the bottom," says home builder analyst Anna Torma of <span class="companylink">Soleil Securities</span>. "But we're cautious about a recovery."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Torma says big numbers in unemployment, foreclosures and inventories of unsold homes will make anything but a shallow recovery unlikely for next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation is most dire for multifamily construction. In April, starts in the five-units-or-more category were down 42% from March. Production has almost ground to a halt. Financing for projects is hard to get. Some builders have too much debt, housing experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is hard to envision those numbers getting any worse," says economist Michael Montgomery of IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mixed report deflated some of the enthusiasm generated Monday by a relatively strong earnings report by No. 2 home-improvement retailer <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> and rising builder confidence as measured by the National Association of Home Builders/<span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Housing Market Index.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes picked up in 17 states in the first quarter compared with the previous one, pointing to more signs of life for the home market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, first-quarter sales of existing homes were down 3.2% from the last three months of 2008 and down 6.8% year-over-year, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the improvement in 17 states is more evidence that the market is bottoming out, economists say. In the fourth quarter, only nine states showed better sales. Economists predict more states will show sales gains throughout the year, given still-falling prices in many markets, low mortgage rates and some signs of improvement in the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are early signs of recovery in some states. They give me reason for optimism," says Patrick Newport, economist at IHS Global Insight. He expects home sales to pick up nationwide in the later part of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of the pickup this year may "surprise to the upside," says Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com. That's because prices have dropped so much that more people can afford homes, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That trend continued in the first quarter. Single-family home prices declined year-over-year in 134 of 152 metropolitan areas, NAR says. Nationwide, the median sales price for a single-family home was $169,000, down 13.8% from the same quarter a year ago. Median means half sold for more and half sold for less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices are skewed downward by the number of foreclosed and distressed homes being sold. They're selling for 20% less than traditional homes and account for about half of all sales, NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's attracting many first-time buyers, who accounted for about half of the quarter's sales, NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low prices -- driven by sales of foreclosed and distressed homes - - helped Minnesota post a 12% gain in the first quarter compared with the same period a year ago, NAR says. Median prices there are at 1997 levels, says Christopher Galler, chief operating officer of the Minnesota Association of Realtors. He says foreclosures and short sales -- in which banks forgive some of what is owed -- account for 50% of transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's also true nationwide, NAR says. The glut of distressed homes on the market will continue to be a "drag on prices," McBride says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The states with the largest sales gains from the fourth quarter were: Wyoming, 44%; Alaska, 37%; Nevada, 25%; and Minnesota, 22%. The figures include single-family homes, condos and co-ops.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More homes for sale are attracting multiple offers as buyers pursue lower-price homes and banks low-ball asking prices to attract competing bids on foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multiple bids have picked up in recent months in California and other states hit hard by foreclosures and steep price drops, real estate executives say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If a house is in a good neighborhood, is maintained and is a good value, it'll get multiple offers," says Julie Holt, owner of Anclote Title Services in Tarpon Springs, Fla. One in 10 homes now draw multiple offers, up from one in 30 last fall, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multiple bids usually signify a market in which prices are rising and buyers outnumber sellers. That's not true now, given rampant foreclosures, still-falling prices in many regions and low demand for higher-price homes. Multiple offers on distressed properties are also not new, but their recent frequency offers hope for the real estate market, says Beth Peerce, treasurer of the California Association of Realtors (CAR).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you begin to see people willing to fight for a property, that's a good sign," she says. "We are beginning to see the beginning of the end of a disaster time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The competition is driven by prices -- California's are down 39% from a year ago, CAR says -- low mortgage rates and a new federal tax credit of up to $8,000 for some first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other hard-hit regions are also seeing more multiple offers, mainly on:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Lower-end homes. In Phoenix, where prices have dropped 50% from their 2006 peak, competition has heated up for homes under $150,000, says Realtor Michael Orr, who publishes the Cromford Report on the Phoenix-area market. He recently considered bidding on one house for $70,000. It had received 14 offers, and Orr was told to bid $110,000 to be considered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Good values. Holt just handled a closing on a Tarpon Springs home close to schools that was listed at $185,000. It won three bids and sold at $192,000. Three years ago, the home would have sold for $280,000, Holt says. Higher-price homes are also getting more multiple bids. "People who always wanted to live on the water are realizing it is time to buy before prices go up," Holt says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some bidders may think foreclosure bargains are waning, says Mike Lyon, CEO of Lyon Real Estate in Sacramento. That market has 1,600 bank-owned properties for sale, vs. 2,800 a year ago, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says banks have lured multiple bids by setting below-market prices. Lyon cautions that government steps to curb foreclosures have delayed some.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are perceiving that they are running out. But there will be more," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The S&amp;P 500, which was down 25% for the year at the bear market low in early March, stormed back into positive territory for 2009 on Monday as investors bet that an economic recovery is on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Better-than-expected data that hint at better days ahead for the battered U.S. economy were again the catalyst that enticed buyers back into the stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales jumped a surprising 3.2% in March, the second monthly gain in a row. And the Commerce Department reported that construction spending climbed 0.3% in March, ending a string of five consecutive monthly declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those two glimmers of hope were the latest in a growing list of so-called economic green shoots sprouting up on Wall Street that point to an easing of the worst recession in decades. The stock market, which is viewed by many investment analysts as a forward- looking animal that prices in future events, rallied sharply on the news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500, which had plunged to a closing low of 676.53 on March 9, rallied 3.4% Monday to 907.24, eclipsing its 2008 year-end close of 903.25. The benchmark index, which is up 0.4% for the year, has rallied 34.1% from its bear market low in March. The rally amounts to a fresh bull market, defined as a gain of 20% from a low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The stock market is forecasting a recovery in the economy," says John Bollinger, founder of investment website BollingerBands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current rally marks the most powerful percentage gain since the last bull market peaked in October 2007, says Bespoke Investment Group. Since March 9, the stock market has gained $2.9 trillion in market value, yet is $8.1 trillion below its peak value, says Wilshire Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bollinger thinks this bull market is for real and has legs. The key to the rally is that most of the major U.S. stock indexes are "breaking out" of down trends, holding patterns and trading ranges, a surge that bodes well for future gains, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics say the sharp rally may be pricing in a far too optimistic scenario for an economic recovery, given the continued weakness in the banking sector, housing market and job market on Main Street. As a result, a pullback can't be ruled out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This rally is being fueled by panic buying by money managers who can't afford to miss the rally," says Scott Black, president of money management firm Delphi Management. "The risk is the economy doesn't turn around as quickly as people think."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ithaca, a small city in Upstate New York, seems like a bucolic refuge from financial woes. It avoided the housing bubble, and so far, it has been sheltered from much of the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local housing market has been lucky because Ithaca, the county seat of Tompkins County, is home to Cornell University and Ithaca College. The education and health care sectors account for more than 60% of the region's employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That is our bread and butter," says Elia Kacapyr, professor of economics at Ithaca College. "We're not growing jobs now, but we're holding steady."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales were up 6.7% in March, compared with the same month last year. But the numbers are small, and that's just a snapshot. In the past 12 months, home sales were down slightly, says Amy Wood Gonzalez, president of the Ithaca Board of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the region is more resilient than many other parts of the state, the Ithaca area is not skating through this recession, Kacapyr says. Cornell University, for example, has announced a retirement incentive program, and it has postponed faculty recruitment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But neither has had a major impact on the housing market. Instead, low mortgage rates and affordable home prices are attracting first-time home buyers, says Gonzalez, who is a Warren Real Estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are starting to get multiple offers on homes under $200,000," she says. "And lakefront homes are really desirable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ithaca attracts many tourists and vacation home buyers because it is at the southernmost end of Cayuga Lake and has many waterfalls, gorges and trails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an Ivy League school and outdoor beauty, Ithaca is often picked as one of the nation's best places to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, <span class="companylink">U.S. News &amp; World Report</span> selected Ithaca as one of the 10 best cities for job-seeking retirees. And in December, Forbes said that the city has the best middle-class housing market in the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list goes on, including this one: In February 2008, SmartMoney named the city as the second-best place to retire during an economic downturn.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelly Butler just got a bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, her new three-bedroom home came with fake barn wood nailed to the bathroom walls, carpet that had to be ripped up, broken closet doors and a need for plumbing and tile work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter. Butler, 27, and her husband, Jim, 28, represent the new face of today's home buyers: first-timers who are snapping up distressed homes and fixer-uppers that are being sold at bargain prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up to 45% of homes being purchased today are in that category, according to an April report by the National Association of Realtors (NAR) -- and that's a major force driving existing home sales. First- time buyers accounted for more than half of all home sales in March. Activity was concentrated in lower price ranges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a troublesome side, because sales of foreclosed and other distressed homes tend to drag down overall home prices across the USA. These properties typically sell for 20% less than traditional homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists tracking the beleaguered housing market say these first-time home buyers represent a critical demographic that could help lead the industry out of its doldrums by buying up much of the excess inventory of homes that is drawing down home values nationwide. And in one promising sign, the inventory of unsold homes is starting to shrink. Total housing inventory at the end of March fell 1.6% to 3.74 million existing homes for sale, which represents a 9.8-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with a 9.7- month supply in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Butlers have been fixing up their home since they moved in on Jan. 31. They plan to paint the brown exterior a cheerier white, with blue shutters. For 3% down, they got the foreclosed home in Stratford, Conn., with three bedrooms and two baths for $213,000 and a fixed loan at a 5.5% interest rate. The price was about 35% less than the previous owners paid a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yeah, it's a little scary from the outside," says Kelly, an operations manager at The <span class="companylink">Regus Group</span>, which rents office space. "But these fixer-uppers are really selling. There were even bidding wars. All these people were fighting for these houses."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hope among housing experts is that interest in millions of such properties across the nation will rise because of low interest rates, a tax credit for first-time home buyers of up to $8,000, and home prices that have sunk in some markets by more than 20%. Distressed homes are moving fast because they often sell below market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the open houses, many first-time home buyers are walking through," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR. "It's a very good sign that first-time home buyers are responding to tax incentives and historically low interest rates. I'm hopeful. This all points toward improving market conditions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unwanted side effect</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs that buyers are jumping off the sidelines to purchase distressed properties is a welcome indication that sales overall could pick up. But sales at these low prices are having the unwanted side effect of drawing down home prices across the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although prices rose from February to March, the national median existing-home prices for all housing types was $175,200, down 12.4% from March 2008, according to NAR, which attributes much of the downward pressure on prices to the sale of distressed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there are potential risks to home buyers, who may leap at the good prices on distressed properties only to find they lose any cost savings because the homes need so much work. The national average cost of a bathroom remodel in 2008-09 is nearly $16,000; a major kitchen remodel runs more than $56,000, and replacing a roof is $18,825, according to Hanley Wood, which analyzes the housing industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It can become like that movie The Money Pit," says Leif Thomsen at Mortgage Master, a provider of mortgage services. "These first- time home buyers getting distressed properties can easily get in over their heads if they don't know what they're doing. We strongly recommend against buying any home at auction, because you can't inspect the property first and have an inspection. There are real risks."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift toward buying distressed properties does have an upside: In areas hard hit by foreclosures such as Florida, California and Nevada, some neighborhoods peppered with boarded-up homes with overgrown lawns now are showing signs of revitalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida was among the 10 states with the highest foreclosure rates, according to an April report by RealtyTrac. Despite a 12% decrease from the previous quarter, Florida's first-quarter total of foreclosures was still the second highest in the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure filings were reported on 119,220 Florida properties, a 36% increase from the first quarter of 2008. The state posted the nation's fourth-highest state foreclosure rate during the quarter, with one in every 73 housing units receiving a foreclosure filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some houses that were in foreclosure had previous owners who took everything that wasn't nailed down, so the homes have had sinks ripped out, baseboards missing and wires dangling where light fixtures used to be; some banks that own the homes have gone in first and done some fix-up work, such as installing sinks, to spur sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those distressed properties and low prices are boosting sales, with NAR reporting home sales higher than a year ago in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What I'm seeing is incredible. At ground zero in Florida, my business has tripled overnight," says Suzanne White, an agent at ZipRealty in Tampa. "There isn't grass overgrown and mosquitoes all around in these neighborhoods anymore. First-time home buyers are saying rates are so low they can pay less than rent. The bank-owned properties are getting multiple offers and selling higher than asking price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sacrifices for fixer-uppers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing isn't as easy to get as it was during 2006, the peak of the housing boom. Buyers need good credit and a solid income that can be documented, and they need to be prepared to put money down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median down payment by first-time buyers was 4% in 2008, up from 2% in 2007, according to NAR. Many are turning to Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, which can require as little as 3.5% down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volume of single-family FHA-insured loans originated has tripled from $59 billion in fiscal year 2007 to more than $180 billion in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a fixer-upper also can mean sacrifices: Buyers may have to wait before they can move in because the homes need work, and first- time buyers often have to look past a home's problems to see the potential. For those buying foreclosed homes, dealing with a bank instead of a private owner can sometimes mean lengthy delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of distressed properties could have a trickle-down effect that may help boost remodeling businesses, which have seen business slump as homeowners halt renovation plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And first-time home buyers are showing more interest. More than three-quarters of first-time home buyers say now is a good time to buy a home despite concern about the economy, according to a March survey by Century 21 Real Estate of 1,000 prospective first-time buyers. More than 80% say prices are affordable, and 68% say now is a better time to buy than six months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kimberly Miles, 26, is one of them. In February, she got an FHA- insured mortgage on a three-bedroom house with a two-car garage, overlooking a lake in Myrtle Beach, S.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flooring, which smelled because of the previous owner's pets and smoking habit, was ripped up. The drywall needed caulking, and the previous owner had taken the fridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home, which had been in foreclosure, was listed at $142,000 in November and dropped to $122,000 in January. With the FHA-loan, she had to put down only 3.5%, and the $8,000 federal tax credit will pay for a lot of the renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It smelled awful. You couldn't breathe in there, but I saw the potential," says Miles, who works for the Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce and Convention and Visitors Bureau. "During the housing boom, I could never have gotten it."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of single-family homes in 20 U.S. metropolitan areas in February were down 18.6% from a year earlier, yet the fact that the rate of decline slowed signaled some hope for the housing market, a report said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 15 markets, annual declines were in excess of 10% and average home prices nationwide hit 2003 levels, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the drop in the 20-city index was less than the 19% year- over-year decline in January. Also, it was the first time in 16 months that annual declines didn't set records. "We ... need a few more months of data before we can determine if home prices are finally turning around," says David Blitzer of S&amp;P's index committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said last week that home prices rose more than normal from February to March and that the market may be stabilizing. Still, price drops remain brutal, especially in areas where they rose fast. The Case-Shiller index shows the hardest-hit cities in February were Phoenix, Las Vegas and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices continue to fall amid a glut of unsold homes, including foreclosed ones, says Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. He says prices will keep falling in regions with many foreclosures and strengthen where there are few.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On that front, the Obama administration Tuesday unveiled a plan that it says may reduce payments for up to 1.5 million at-risk homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plan, the government would tap a $50 billion housing fund to entice mortgage servicers to modify second mortgages and cut monthly payments for borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half the troubled mortgages have second loans, given by lenders to help buyers avoid mortgage insurance and reduce their down payments. The second loans make it harder to modify first loans, because more parties are involved, and the home may still be unaffordable even if a first loan is changed, the administration says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan would pay mortgage servicers $500 to modify second loans at 1% or 2% for five years, if first loans are modified. Servicers would also get $250 a year for three years if borrowers don't default. Borrowers could get $1,000 over five years to pay down principal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan may encourage modifications because second loans would likely be worthless in a foreclosure, says Ellen Harnick of the Center for Responsible Lending. It could have a significant impact on prices if foreclosures are curbed, she says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many would consider Hawaii a worry-free zone, that's not been the case for the Maui real estate market. Its steady decline over the past few years shows no sign of stopping anytime soon, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The popular vacation- and retirement-home destination benefited greatly from the technology bubble in the 1990s as wealth spread rapidly, University of Hawaii economist Byron Gangnes says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were low; the scenery exotic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These areas are much more attractive because they're not in big urban centers like Honolulu," he says. "It's the landscape, quality of life that is somewhat slower that people like."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such appeal sent Maui's housing market booming for about a decade until things began to unravel a few years ago, Gangnes says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless, home construction continued through last year, but the recession has left Maui with many foreclosures and half-built and empty homes, says Terry Tolman, chief staff executive of the Realtors Association of Maui.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the Maui market is heavily dependent on the national and global economy, because most of its home buyers are not native islanders, Gangnes says the recent economic downturn added to but did not cause the waning demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A good part of the decline would have happened regardless," he says. "This is not a process that happened overnight. The expectation is that there will be a weak housing market coming off such a big boom. The recession is just another source of weakness in the already deteriorating condition."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And although Maui's median home price is still nearly $350,000 more than the national median price, Tolman and Gangnes expect prices to drop further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do not think this is the bottom," Gangnes says. "It's hard sometimes to tell where the market's moving because of how few transactions there are, but it's just an indication of how weak demand is."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued to slide last month as foreclosed and other distressed properties drew first-time buyers and bargain hunters into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although prices rose from February to March, the national median existing-home price for all housing types was $175,200, down 12.4% from March 2008, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of distressed homes made up about half of all sales, and about two-thirds of those were foreclosures. Distressed homes also include short sales, in which properties are sold for less than the balance owed on the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March sales fell 3% from February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.57 million properties. The February rate was revised downward to 4.71 million. Last month's sales were 7% lower than in March 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales are largely being driven by first-time home buyers, who now make up more than half of transactions. Meanwhile, sales of higher- priced homes have almost entirely stalled, in part because of the higher interest rates that accompany so-called jumbo mortgage loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, says that the more modest ups and downs seen in home sales in recent months suggest the market appears to be stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We still need to see a consistent increase, and that's not happening now," he says. "Hopefully, by early this summer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tax credit of up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers and low interest rates are helping lure some buyers into the market. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 4.80%, down from 4.82% last week, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales were higher than a year ago in Minneapolis, Northern Virginia, Las Vegas, Phoenix and most areas of California and Florida, where prices have taken large hits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in one promising sign, the inventory of unsold homes is beginning to shrink. Total housing inventory at the end of March fell 1.6% to 3.74 million existing homes available for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of that inventory must be absorbed before prices will stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over the past five months, home sales haven't changed all that much. They haven't seen much life," says Patrick Newport at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lower prices aren't stimulating sales. We still have a big problem in the credit market. The money banks are lending is going to refinancing, not to home purchases."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Los Angeles have declined sharply, and it's unclear if they've hit bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price in Los Angeles was $308,540 in February, down from $478,350 a year ago and $616,230 in February 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The boom is over, but I don't know if the bust is over," says Betty Graham, president of Coldwell Banker Greater Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The well-documented surge in foreclosures has dragged down prices. Last year, the foreclosure rate in Los Angeles and Long Beach rose 113.5%, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures have been partly caused by rising unemployment, says Jack Kyser, economist at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. But the rate also has climbed because many homeowners got adjustable-rate mortgages they could barely afford, and then saw their interest rates reset much higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The potential good news: Many home buyers view the current market as an opportunity. In February, home sales in Los Angeles were up 69.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower-cost homes and lower mortgage rates have driven the market as first-time home buyers zero in on foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even high-end property is starting to show some sales life. "In the last 30 days, we have had many negotiations going on in the above-$3 million price range," Graham says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will it all stick? Who knows: The weak economy is making the future housing market hard to predict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our economy is struggling right now," Kyser says. "But it's a mixed bag."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the Los Angeles entertainment industry is doing well because of high box office sales, but tourism and travel are down, he says. And while there are plans for school-, highway- and bridge- construction projects, the housing-construction industry is still struggling mightily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a significant fear factor, and people are not certain about what is going to happen next," Kyser says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who work in the real estate business are cautiously waiting to see how the rest of the year unfolds. But Graham is positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've been doing this for over 30 years," she says. "I can sense the pulse of the market, and it is improving."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts tumbled 10.8% in March, a distress sign that economists say means housing construction will not make a big turnaround soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new homes and apartments fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 510,000 units, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That was the second-lowest rate in the department's records, which go back 50 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline was more than many economists had expected and took off some of the glow from a reported increase in February. The February figure was also revised downward in Thursday's report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for building permits fell 9% in March to a 513,000 seasonally adjusted annual pace, the lowest on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Larson, a housing analyst at Weiss Research, says the numbers are being strongly affected by the starts in the multifamily home segment, whose numbers tend to swing widely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders are having a hard time competing with these low prices on almost-new and foreclosed homes," Larsen says. "You're seeing things getting a little less bad on the housing arena, but there is still a market that is oversupplied. Nothing suggests an imminent recovery."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reduced housing starts could help shorten the time necessary to clear the nation's oversupply of available homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of newly built homes for sale has shrunk from a peak of about 555,000 three years ago to about 300,000 today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction has fallen in part due to the difficulty builders have getting credit, consolidations within the industry, and the fact that home prices are often coming in below construction cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts "are at extraordinarily low levels," says Mark Zandi at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "We are at a bottom in terms of construction. It's very hard on the home-building industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He predicts new construction will pick up by this time next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported last month that home construction had increased more than 20% in February. That was revised in Thursday's report to 17.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The numbers are bouncing around, which is not that much of a surprise," says Joel Naroff at Naroff Economic Advisors. "Single- family starts were essentially flat. That gives me some hope that that segment of the market is starting to stabilize."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homeowners facing foreclosure surged in March as lenders lifted temporary moratoriums and resumed legal actions against delinquent mortgage payers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure filings -- default notices, auction sale notices and bank repossessions -- were reported on 341,180 properties in March, 46% more than a year ago and 17% above February's total, RealtyTrac reports today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One in 159 U.S. housing units received at least one foreclosure notice in the first quarter, for a total of 803,459, according to RealtyTrac, which lists foreclosed properties around the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp increase in foreclosures comes as the Obama administration is launching an effort to help as many as 9 million borrowers avoid foreclosure by modifying their loans or refinancing mortgages. Many lenders put a temporary freeze on foreclosures late last year while the administration prepared its program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of March's activity was in new foreclosure actions -- bank repossessions fell 3% from February. With most of the moratoriums now lifted, bank repossessions are likely to start rising again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we'll see foreclosures surge through the summer," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increasing number of jobless Americans is likely to accelerate the supply of foreclosures, which in turn will continue to pull down housing prices, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This report shows that the housing problems are not going away anytime soon," says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. "Supply from foreclosed homes coming on the market will continue to pressure prices through this year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights of RealtyTrac's report:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Five states -- California, Florida, Arizona, Nevada and Illinois -- accounted for almost 60% of the first-quarter foreclosure activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Nevada had the nation's highest state foreclosure rate in the first quarter -- more than five times the national average. One in every 27 housing units received a foreclosure filing during the quarter, RealtyTrac reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Arizona had the nation's second-highest state foreclosure rate for the first quarter, with one in 54 housing units receiving a foreclosure filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*California posted the nation's third-highest state foreclosure rate, with one in every 58 housing units receiving a foreclosure filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to Florida and Illinois, the other states with foreclosure rates ranking among the top 10 in the first quarter were Michigan, Georgia, Idaho, Utah and Oregon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, Rochester, Minn., has been sheltered from the housing crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many other housing markets experienced a dramatic boom and bust, but Rochester has remained relatively stable because its largest employer is the Mayo Clinic. The teaching hospital has a revolving door of residents and fellows, who tend to be home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Typically they come in knowing full well that they only are going to live here for three or four or five years," says Robin Gwaltney, a real estate agent. "But they buy a home instead of renting property, and they sell it when they are leaving."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean that Rochester's housing market has not been affected by the economic downturn at all, though. For example, another large employer is IBM, which had job cuts last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Rochester area, home prices were down 11% in February, compared with the same month in 2008. Meanwhile, home sales were up 6.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, home sales and home prices fell a bit, says Chad Carpenter, president of the Southeast Minnesota Association of Realtors. The move-up home market has been the most affected by economic worries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think a lot of people have put the brakes on selling their starter home and are not moving up to a bigger, more expensive home," Gwaltney says. "They may decide that this home will last them for a while longer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home foreclosure has not dragged down the housing market. "Compared to North Minneapolis, it's a drop in the bucket," says Chris Flood, program director of the Rochester Area Foundation, who tracks foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subprime loans have not been a major driver of foreclosures. "Foreclosure seems to have been (caused by) the same issues as they have been in the past," Flood says. "They have always been caused by divorce, injuries and major financial events."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one can predict the future, but for now Rochester's housing market is holding steady, relative to other parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are pretty insulated," Carpenter says. "We have a low unemployment rate, and our population base is still growing. We have a small-town feel, and I think that's the biggest draw."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traverse City, Mich., which claims to be the Cherry Capital of the World, seems like a world away from Detroit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the Motor City, which is home to the struggling auto industry, Traverse City is a pristine corner of northwest Michigan that stretches along the shores of Grand Traverse Bay. It is the largest city in the region, and employers range from wineries to a major medical center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, first-time home buyers and vacation-home buyers have been drawn to Traverse City. Still, the housing market has been hit by the mortgage crisis and the crumbling economy: In February, home sales were down 17.4% compared with the same month in 2008. The median home price last month was 8.5% lower, pushing prices to their lowest in 15 years, says Mary Janik, president of the Traverse Area Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure has been one cause, though filings have slowed. The rate has dropped to one filing for every 468 housing units in the first two months of 2009 from one in 360 the last two months of 2008, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the filings have been caused by job loss. The Traverse City area is known for its tourism and manufacturing base, but it also has a number of local automotive suppliers. They have been dragged down by the auto industry, says Tino Breithaupt, senior vice president of economic development at the Traverse City Area Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Tower Automotive</span>, for example, is shutting its plant, affecting 358 workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-priced vacation homes have been affected because many auto company executives own them, says Rick Matley, a local real estate agent. "When they started losing their jobs, their second homes had to be sold, and so the prices have been lowered," Matley says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now waterfront properties are starting to attract buyers from Ohio to Illinois who want a vacation home. And first-time home buyers are finding great deals and low mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The activity isn't what it was a couple of years ago," Janik says. "But we are seeing improvement -- a nice and slow and steady progress."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in January plunged a record 19% from a year ago in 20 U.S. metropolitan areas, signaling continued distress in the housing market, according to a report Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year-over-year drop in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index was more than many economists had expected. All 20 areas showed annual declines, and in nine of them, prices fell more than 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are falling amid a glut of unsold homes that includes a growing supply of foreclosed properties with well-below-market prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cities in Case-Shiller's 20-city index with the steepest year- over-year declines were Phoenix, down 35%; Las Vegas, off 32.5%; San Francisco, down 32.4%; and Miami, off 29.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The places with the biggest housing bubbles were California, Nevada and Florida, so they had the biggest declines. Most other states had bubbles but not nearly as big," says Patrick Newport at IHS Global Insight. "Still, it's a grim report. January was a terrible month for housing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-city home-price index fell 2.8% in January compared with December, setting a record for the steepest month-to-month decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data don't reflect several recent initiatives, including an $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers that passed in February and the Obama administration's housing rescue program, which includes $75 billion for preventing foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also doesn't capture the recent rise in mortgage applications that has accompanied falling interest rates. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reported last week that the average for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage fell to 4.85% from the week before, the lowest since its weekly survey began in 1971. The average rate was 5.85% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've seen better news recently, like sales of new and existing homes," says Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at Economic Outlook Group. "We don't believe the index has incorporated what appears to be a bottoming out in the housing sector in terms of demand. Recent reports show housing is stabilizing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bright spot: The median price of existing homes rose from $164,800 in January to $165,400 in February, the first increase since June, the National Association of Realtors says. Existing home sales also rose 5.1% in February.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing homes sales rose in February as prices fell sharply due to the nation's increasing supply of distressed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes jumped 5.1% in February, reversing the decline in January, according to a report Monday by the National Association of Realtors. Many economists believe the drop in January was an anomaly and that last month's rise in home sales could be the first sign of stabilizing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.72 million units from a pace of 4.49 million units in January, but they are still 4.6% below the 4.95 million-unit level in February 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was nice to see," says Joel Naroff, with Naroff Economic Advisors. "February and December were similar (in showing an increase). If there is another similar increase in March, I will think prices may be stabilizing. Sales have pretty much hit bottom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed properties accounted for up to 45% of transactions in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median existing-home price was $165,400 in February, down 15.5% from $195,800 a year ago. That was the second-largest drop on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower interest rates also are bringing buyers off the sidelines. For the week ending March 13, mortgage loan application volume increased 21.2% on a seasonally adjusted basis from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased to 4.89% from 4.96%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers are eligible for lower rates, and prices have come down," says Brian Bethune, with IHS Global Insight. "A lot of things are factoring in to potentially generate more sales."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The West saw a 2.6% increase in sales, and the median price of $204,600 was about 30% below a year ago. California, where the median listing price is beginning to rise for the first time in three years, led the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Northeast, sales jumped 15.6% in February from January. The median price was $251,200, down 4.8% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in the Midwest increased 1%. The median price was $131,000, which is 7.8% below February 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the South, sales rose 6.1% in February. The median price in the South was $146,700, down 10% from a year ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market in Memphis keeps tumbling, which makes it like many other parts of the nation -- except it had been stable until very recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've not been extremely flashy," says Jon Albright, president of the Memphis Area Association of Realtors. "And over the years, the housing market has not been prone to huge swings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the city has been stung by home foreclosures. Initially, foreclosures were sparked by the subprime mortgage meltdown. Now they occur because of the economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People who became unemployed simply aren't finding new jobs," says John Gnuschke, director of the Sparks Bureau of Business and Economic Research at The University of Memphis. "And that has increased the foreclosure problem and changed its nature."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the home foreclosure rate in Memphis rose 53%, according to RealtyTrac. And its foreclosure rate ranked Memphis No. 18 out of the top 100 cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most buyers are now purchasing median- and low-price distressed homes, Albright says. "That segment has got to be cleaned up to a degree before we can get back to a stable market," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in Memphis were down 38.8% in January from a year earlier. And the median price dropped 15%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction has all but stopped, so home inventory is decreasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low home prices and low interest rates, along with the first- time home buyer tax credit available in 2009, have made this an opportune time to consider buying a home for some.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market hasn't turned around, but more people are going to open houses, Albright says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is some cautious optimism," he says. "At some point this year, we expect the market to bottom out. For those who are considering buying a home, it's a wonderful opportunity."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing construction showed unexpected gains in February, but economists warn that the battered sector may suffer more before hitting bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Tuesday that construction of new homes and apartments jumped 22.2% in February compared with January, pushing activity to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 583,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The positive report contributed to a stock market rally that pushed the Dow Jones industrial average up 179 points, or 2.5%, to 7396.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gain in housing starts was the first in eight months and reflected a "modest rebound" from January -- the worst month in history for new home production, says David Crowe, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with February's big increase, housing starts were 47% below their level the same time last year, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February's jump was propelled by an 82% surge in multifamily construction. That was likely driven by weather, as bad storms delayed projects in the Northeast and Midwest in December and January, says Patrick Newport, economist with IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more meaningful surprise in February's data was that building permits for single-family homes jumped 11% from the previous month, the first gain in nine months, he says. If that trend continues several months, it may signal that "housing has hit bottom," Newport says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a big if, he and other economists say. IHS says housing starts and permits have further to fall, because the outlook for builders continues to deteriorate. Prices of existing homes are dropping, inventory of unsold homes remains near all-time highs and foreclosures are still increasing. If financial markets improve and banks ramp up lending, the housing market should hit bottom later this year, IHS says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the month, single-family home starts increased by 1.1% compared with January. They remain 80% below the peak in January 2006, says <span class="companylink">Soleil Securities</span> equity analyst Anna Torma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a research note Tuesday, she warned that the slight increase is likely due to a sharp decline in January and is a "temporary reprieve." She also says starts will decline further as a result of "further deterioration in market fundamentals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the warnings, investors viewed the housing data as a glimmer of good news and snapped up shares of home builders. Lennar jumped 9% to $8.52. <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span> rose 7% to $10.16, and <span class="companylink">Toll Bros</span>. climbed 6% to $17.06.</p>

</div><div class="author">Kim Thai   </div><div>473 words</div><div>17 March 2009</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.7</div><div>English</div><div>© 2009 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strained energy industry, a devastating hurricane and the trickle-down effects of the national economy have teamed to squeeze Houston's real estate market, which at times has seemed immune from the national downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time last year, the Bayou City experienced a small boom in home sales as the median price climbed more than $15,000. And last summer, personal finance experts at Kiplinger named the fourth- largest metropolitan area the best city in the country, calling it the "Comeback Kid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household income grew an estimated 13% from 2000 to 2007, and the aerospace, technology and medical fields created more than 100,000 jobs. The job growth was the best among big cities nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were booming, and mortgage interest rates came down," says Jim Gaines, a research economist at the Real Estate Center at Texas A&amp;M University. "Houston was doing very, very, very well. We didn't have the big bubble in house prices like elsewhere."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Hurricane Ike's arrival in September, which devastated Galveston Island and other areas, caused delays in home building and pushed many homeowners to rent. The market slipped: From September to January, median sales prices dropped by more than $25,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gaines attributes the decline to the increase in foreclosure sales in the area, as many customers took advantage of the buyer's market and looked to renovate for profit. Also, about 1,000 fewer homes were sold in January compared with January 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Houston's housing market is strong compared with other metropolitan areas, Gaines says, and it has not "experienced the kind of downturn that is getting notoriety."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The energy sector and its jobs help shield Houston, so the metropolitan area doesn't experience the full effects of the national economy until about 10 months after the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The energy sector was a big driver, but with the price of oil and natural gas down, "We feel it coming around the corner," Gaines says. "The Texas and Houston economy are getting nervous. We know we're not immune to the economic state."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A substantial amount of housing built this decade has shifted from open fields on the edges of suburbia to dense central cities and their nearby suburbs, a new government study suggests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change suggests that a much-publicized urban renaissance in the past 15 years is more than an isolated trend, some urban analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In more than half of the 50 most populous metropolitan areas, communities at the urban core have captured a significantly larger share of their region's new residential building permits since 2002 than in the first half of the 1990s, according to an analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a very striking trend," says John Thomas, an EPA policy analyst and author of the report. "It seems to be holding up the first year of the real estate market downturn."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-standing patterns remain: A large share of residential construction still takes place on farmland on remote fringes of metro areas. In most regions, new housing in urban core neighborhoods accounts for less than half. Nonetheless, there was a consistent increase in housing in urban centers from 2002 to 2007, and the trend could transform growth patterns in some places for decades to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For years, there was just one model -- homes in auto-dependent suburbs," says David Goldberg with Smart Growth America, a national coalition that advocates denser development to allow easy access to jobs and services on foot or mass transit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes in demographics, high gas prices and longer commutes on congested roads are generating more interest in smaller homes in urban settings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The development industry finally began to create the kind of in- town products that people were looking for," Goldberg says. "It also reflects the investment that a lot of metro areas have made in rail transit systems."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The battered economy presents challenges -- downtown housing is struggling with vacancies just as exurban subdivisions are, says Joel Kotkin, a presidential fellow at Chapman University in Orange, Calif., who writes about urban history and trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have to have an economy to sustain high-density housing," he says, and most jobs are created in the suburbs. "Very few mayors focus on job creation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The EPA study analyzed the share of residential building permits that were issued in a region's core city, its close-in suburbs and suburbs farther out from 1990 to 1995 and from 2002 to 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparing those two periods was bound to show a growth in construction in the center because not much was happening in cities in the early '90s, Kotkin says. "It was the absolute nadir," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study highlighted 2007 results to capture the effect of the start of the housing collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a clear trend going on, but it's not universal," Thomas says:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In 15 regions, the central city greatly increased its share of residential building permits. Those regions include large cities with strong ties to the global economy (New York, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles) and medium cities that are leaders in controlling growth (Portland, Ore., Denver).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In 26 cities, including Sacramento and Milwaukee, the share has doubled or tripled since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Old suburbs on the edge of cities captured a significant chunk of new housing in eight metropolitan areas, including Boston, Minneapolis and Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*The shift also occurred in Atlanta, where the metropolitan area has been sprawling for decades. The share of permits issued in the city went from 4% in the early '90s to 13% this decade. In 2007, it jumped to 21%, reflecting a slowdown in more remote areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta renewed its focus on attracting residents after it hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics. Public housing was redeveloped, and a beautification push created parks and trails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a period of time when the United States started thinking more about smart growth," says Dan Reuter, land use chief at the Atlanta Regional Commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo development took off as more young professionals came to Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Demographics have really changed," Reuter says. "People are waiting longer to get married, longer to have children, and once children are grown up, we're living longer."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a long time, the housing market in Binghamton, N.Y., the county seat of Broome County, seemed to dodge the problems battering the rest of the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sailed through the mortgage crisis. Home sales had not skyrocketed, so they didn't crash, either. And there was no construction run-up like so many other cities had seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even last March, the local housing market was looking pretty rosy. It was listed as one of the top five hottest markets in the nation, according to NBC's Today show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For years, we lamented the fact that we didn't have new construction, and it ended up being a blessing in disguise," says Jennifer Arbach, president of the Greater Binghamton Association of Realtors. "We now don't have those $400,000 homes sitting empty on the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Binghamton couldn't continue to fend off the gloomy national economy. Late last year, the housing market slipped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices started to drop, and home sales fell. By January, sales dropped 27.8% compared with the same month in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Binghamton metro area, jobs are down, says Christian Harris, a senior economist for New York State Labor Department. "We have held off from the national ills for quite awhile," he says. "Unfortunately, we are definitely catching up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He expects the housing market to remain in a slump the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least the downturn in home prices has attracted home buyers. "We are starting to see multiple offers" on houses, Arbach says. "And that's a good sign."</p>

A possible solution: Rent these homes as a first step toward a more affordable, flexible housing system.</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past half-century, owning a single-family home has formed the cornerstone of the American Dream. James Truslow Adams introduced that phrase in 1931, at the heart of the Great Depression, defining it as the "dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, those two aspects of the American Dream -- a better, richer life and homeownership -- are in conflict. We could well look back on this moment and conclude that Americans acted as indentured servants to their homes. Single-family homeownership consumes an ever-larger share of income for far too many people, sometimes bankrupting them, but far more commonly severely constricting their way of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The system of single-family homeownership served us well for decades, helping set in motion a long wave of industrial expansion that fueled suburbanization and all the consumption that went with it. My father, a factory worker, toiled at the same Newark, N.J., eye-glass plant his entire working life. My parents lived in one house in nearby North Arlington, which they bought in 1959 and lived in until they died.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the housing system should no longer be allowed to put the nation's economy at risk, President Obama has gone overboard with his plan to stabilize housing, stem the tide of foreclosures and breathe life back into the paralyzed mortgage market. His quest to reinvigorate homeownership actually acts against the flexibility and affordability needed for economic recovery. Less homeownership and more rental housing is what today's idea-driven economy needs:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Flexibility. The heart of a creative economy is flexibility. But homeownership is by definition inflexible. Various economic studies show that those who own homes, especially those who fill the ranks of the working class, are hobbled in their ability to respond to downturns in business cycles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As homeownership rates rose, eventually reaching a peak of nearly 70% in 2004 -- our society became less footloose. Last year fewer Americans moved, as a percentage of the population, than in any year since the Census Bureau started tracking address changes in the late 1940s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This creeping rigidity in the labor market handcuffs our competitiveness. Economist Andrew Oswald has found that in the U.S. and Europe, places with higher homeownership rates also suffered from higher unemployment. During down times, homeownership can lock people into blighted locations and force them into work, if they can find it, that's a poor match for their abilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Affordability. Homeownership is also a financial albatross around the necks of too many "house poor" people. The rule of thumb used to be that you should pay 25%-30% of your income on housing. But the amount people pay has skyrocketed. Add in transportation, utility bills, food and clothing, and what's left over to create demand for an industry's goods and services? It's reckless for Obama to propose foreclosure relief that would extend mortgage terms to 40 years and reduce monthly payments to 38% -- or even 31% -- of income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of all this, homeownership doesn't make us happier. A recent study by Grace Wong Bucchianeri, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of business, shows that, controlling for income and demographics, homeowners are no happier than renters and report higher levels of stress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What about building equity in your home and taking advantage of mortgage interest deductions? If your home is now worth less than your mortgage, and you've already borrowed against the equity in your house, that's the least of your concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's needed is a complete overhaul as sweeping in scope as the one that brought to us the modern system of housing finance during the 1930s and the post-World War II homeownership boom. In his forthcoming book The Wealth of Cities, my University of Toronto colleague Chris Kennedy shows that real economic recovery and rapid expansion will come only from major upgrades in infrastructure, new housing patterns and significant shifts in consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foreclosure crisis, therefore, creates a real opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's start with overburdened homeowners. Instead of resisting foreclosures, the federal government should facilitate them in ways that minimize pain and disruption. The government could work with banks and real estate companies to offer to rent each home to the previous owner at market rates, which are typically lower than mortgage payments, for a certain number of years. At the end of that period, the former homeowner could be given the option to repurchase the home at the prevailing market price. Some banks have started taking this step.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what about the homeowners already forced into foreclosure? The government could help banks and large real estate companies turn these homes into rental properties, helping to clean up neighborhoods while providing affordable rental housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bigger, healthier rental market, with more choices, would also enable millions of people to move and find jobs, which in turn would make the lives of more people and the nation's economy more stable.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market in San Jose has turned upside down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are plummeting, and sales are rising. Last year, the market headed in the opposite direction. Homes in San Jose had been so costly for so long that many families had been priced out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When our median sales price was $850,000, two (income) working families could hardly afford to buy a home," says Quincy Virgilio, president of Santa Clara County Association of Realtors. In the past five years, only 16% of the local population could afford to buy a home in San Jose, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January 2008, the median home price was $664,444. It started to fall dramatically in October. And home sales hit bottom last year. Now that the median price is $415,000, homes seem to be a bargain, and nearly 50% of the local population can afford to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing a confluence of events," Virgilio says. "Interest rates are at a record low, and the affordability in San Jose is at a five-year high."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main reason that home values have fallen steeply is foreclosure. Last year, the foreclosure rate in San Jose was 153% higher than it was in 2007, according to RealtyTrac.com. Last month, 67.5% of sales were related to bank-owned properties and short sales, Virgilio says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People were getting into homes they couldn't afford," says Anne Ramstetter Wenzel, principal economist at Econosystems. "The value of their home is now less than what they paid for and what the mortgage is. That encourages people to walk away."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has created opportunities for first-time home buyers. Homes priced under $400,000, the low-end of the market, are getting multiple offers, Virgilio says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley already had to deal with a painful shakeout that hit its high-tech industry in 2001. "We had a long, protracted adjustment, and jobs didn't resume growth until the end of 2005," Wenzel says. Now local businesses are strong, Wenzel says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Jose's housing market experts say that home sales will continue to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's textbook economics," Wenzel says. "Lower prices are stimulating sales."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes plunged unexpectedly in January to the lowest level since 1997, a sign that even bargain prices weren't enough to draw home buyers into the dismal housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales, which had been predicted to rise, tumbled 5.3% to an annual rate of 4.49 million in January, down from 4.74 million properties in December, according to a report Wednesday from the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices sank nearly 15% from a median of $199,800 a year ago to $170,300 in January. That was the second-largest drop in NAR records. Several factors are behind the slump:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Foreclosure moratoriums. Many lenders -- including mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> -- have instituted moratoriums on foreclosures, which means sales of foreclosed homes have stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's somewhat of a surprise," says Brian Bethune of IHS Global Insight, adding that the most recent report on pending home sales showed an increase. "But existing home sales are driven by foreclosures, and moratoriums on foreclosures will reduce the numbers. That was what had been driving some of the gains."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Housing rescue plan. Some wary buyers may have stayed out of the market last month, anticipating the Obama administration's housing rescue plan could help them get a better deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama announced the plan last week, and details about how it will work are expected next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $75 billion plan, among other things, will include an up to $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers that many economists expect will help spur sales later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economic situation deteriorated due to the jobless rate and consumer confidence," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. "But serious buyers wanted to know what was going to be in the stimulus bill before they signed a contract. They were waiting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Interest rate volatility. So many issues are in flux, including weekly volatility in interest rates and uncertainty about the effect of Obama's housing affordability plan, that indicators such as home sales are reflecting ongoing uncertainty about the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications dropped 15.1% for the week ended Feb. 20, and refinancing activity also declined 19%, according to a Wednesday report by the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average interest rate for 30-year, fixed mortgages increased to 5.07% from 4.99% the week earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier reports showed home sales had been on the rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR's previous report found existing home annual sales rate rose 6.5% to 4.74 million in December from 4.45 million in November.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexandria, Va., a historic city close to the nation's capital, always has been a desirable place to live. It may be even more attractive now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns about gas prices and frustration with gridlock traffic have sparked more interest in the city, says Susan Mekenney, chairman of the Northern Virginia Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workers can rely on four Metro stations within Alexandria's city limits to ride trains to work, instead having to drive. And many Washington, D.C., employers subsidize Metro passes, says Gayl Warman, a Coldwell Banker real estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throw in that the metro area has the lowest unemployment rate among the country's top 15 metropolitan areas, and it's no wonder prices (down 5.0%) have not dipped as much as elsewhere, says John McClain, senior fellow at the Center for Regional Analysis, George Mason University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We used to call ourself 'recession-proof,' " Mekenney says. "That's not true anymore, but we are not feeling what the rest of the country is feeling."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job growth is focused on highly paid professional employees, McClain says. That is good news for Alexandria's housing market, because single-family homes are not cheap: The median price is $680,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With such high prices, it's no wonder that condominiums have held up better than single-family homes, McClain says. And because they are generally more affordable than homes and townhouses, they give first-time home buyers an option in Alexandria. In December, condominium sales were up 4% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are low and sellers are willing to negotiate, Mekenney says. Traffic through homes on the market has been good, she says, but that doesn't mean potential buyers are rushing to make offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are very sensitive and well-informed here," Warman says. "They are also fairly optimistic."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales showed unexpected improvement in December, driven by much-reduced prices in the West and lower interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rose 6.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.74 million properties in December from 4.45 million in November, according to a report Monday by the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Economists had been predicting a drop of around 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It looks like, especially out West where prices are collapsing, that lower prices and lower mortgage rates are generating demand," says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 0.5% in September 2008; however, the December gain was the biggest since January 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's behind the recent rise:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Low prices. The uptick in sales was driven especially by home buyers in California, Nevada, Arizona, Florida and other distressed markets where home prices have tumbled. Those are also where foreclosure rates have been highest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up 13.6% in the West, 7.4% in the South and 4.0% in the Midwest, but slipped 1.4% in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median home price was $175,400 in December, which is 15.3% below December 2007, when the median was $207,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Lower interest rates. For those who qualify, interest rates are still at historic lows -- making it a tantalizing time to buy. Interest rates on a 30-year, fixed loan were 5.12% for the week ended Wednesday, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benjamin Roberts, 32, an account executive at e3communications, plans to close on an 1875 Italian-style fixer-upper in Buffalo next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've been looking for a while and it was scarier when the market started going down, but I got a 4.5% fixed rate," says Roberts, a first-time buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales could continue to rise if buyers' insecurities are allayed by passage of an economic stimulus package, says Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, troubling signs persist. Mortgage applications as a whole decreased for the week ended Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And despite the pickup in home sales, sales are still anemic: Existing-home sales in December were 3.5% below the 4.9 million pace in December 2007, NAR reports. For all of 2008, sales were 13% below transactions recorded in 2007.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even cities with seemingly strong and stable economic foundations have been unable to withstand the housing crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider Montgomery, Ala., the state capital that has a plethora of state and military jobs, and is home to conservative bankers, Alabama State University, Auburn University at Montgomery and Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the local housing market didn't get clobbered by subprime lending woes and resulting foreclosures, the city has not been spared a housing slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales were down 43.5% in November, compared with a year earlier. The downturn has been caused by economic worries, says Keivan Deravi, a professor of economics at Auburn University at Montgomery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state government began to slash its budget last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The city is tightening its belt to deal with the realities of declining revenues," Mayor Bobby Bright said during his budget address last August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major employer, <span class="companylink">Hyundai Motor Manufacturing</span>, is not laying off employees, but it gave all 3,000-plus of them furloughs in December. And the local unemployment rate has nudged up to about 5.9%, although it's less than the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder home buyers and sellers are more cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"About four people in my neighborhood got into the market to sell their homes," Deravi says. "Because they couldn't sell them, they are holding back for a better time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction also has slowed, says Dee Morris, president of Montgomery Area Association of Realtors. Prices on newer, high-end homes are falling because those homes are stuck on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of that and low mortgage rates, now is a great time to buy a home, Morris says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many buyers are waiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We didn't have the excesses of many other metro areas, but there is a very clear slowdown that appears to be happening," Deravi says. "Montgomery's participation in the recession is not voluntary, but it's mandatory."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the winter, the Continental Divide protects Missoula, Mont., from the arctic air. It has not, though, protected it from the frigid housing crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in Missoula County were down sharply in November -- 64.2% -- compared with a year earlier. Experts say the local mortgage market has been stable, but the national mortgage crisis and the economic downturn have sparked much anxiety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People think that things are falling apart here," says Larry Swanson, an economist at the University of Montana. "But we did not overbuild. We didn't have subprime mortgages all over the place. We don't have many foreclosures occurring and causing real estate values to plummet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the median home price continues to rise, and is up 11.3% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales, though, are being dragged down by a few factors other than the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In a nutshell, our market is a destination market, and people are not coming here," says Bryan Flaherty, president of the Missoula Organization of Realtors. "They are not able to sell where they now live." As a result, construction has slacked off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's probably the biggest hit that we're taking now," Flaherty says. "Our builders, framers, carpenters, plumbers and electricians are not as busy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Missoula's economy has a relatively high dependency on construction and real estate, but unemployment still is not as high as the national average, Swanson says. That's because local industries also include health care and professional services. And Missoula is home to the University of Montana, which is a source of stability, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the national economic meltdown, lower mortgage rates and affordable homes may help Missoula's housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think the housing market is going to slide through it, although we're going to be beaten up," Swanson says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices are sliding in Eugene -- but not enough to boost sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even though prices are relatively cheap by some West Coast standards, relative to incomes here, they are actually somewhat expensive," says Tim Duy, director of the Oregon Economic Forum at the University of Oregon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with the most-overvalued housing markets nationwide, Eugene ranked 10th in IHS Global Insight's report for the third quarter of 2008. "Instead of bursting, we have had a slow leak," says Lorena Teer, president of the Eugene Association of Realtors, of home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Eugene, the county seat of Lane County, has a foreclosure rate well below the national average. In Lane County, one in every 865 homes was in foreclosure in November, compared with one in 488 nationally, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its favor, the city has had a smart growth plan that prevents too much construction, Teer says. Tracts of land were not available to speculative building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the housing market became a little overheated, it happened much later than elsewhere in the nation, Duy says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eugene's market is still working off the price increase as it faces other challenges, including rising unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are suffering from the same economic downturn as most regions of the country, with some of our key industries in decline or, in some cases, they have closed entirely," Duy says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, <span class="companylink">Hynix Semiconductor</span> closed its Eugene factory last summer, eliminating about 1,400 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers have hunkered down: "They are saying that they are waiting until the market hits bottom," Teer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer investors are buying homes because it is more difficult to get a conventional mortgage, she says. And many families who want to move to Eugene from states like California are waiting to sell their homes there before moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eugene still offers many advantages to home buyers, says Jim Barnhart, a real estate agent. It is home to the University of Oregon, and it's close to the ocean and mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's large enough to be intellectually invigorating," he says. "And it's small enough to be intimate and caring."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American dream is shrinking. For the first time in at least a decade, builders are substantially reducing the size of new houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're trending toward smaller homes," says Gopal Ahluwalia, director of research for the National Association of Home Builders. He says growth in the average size of new single-family homes, which went from 1,750 square feet in 1978 to 2,479 in 2007, is starting to reverse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His analysis of Census data shows that homes started in the third quarter of 2008 averaged 2,438 square feet, down from 2,629 square feet in the second quarter. Ahluwalia, who began the quarterly analysis in 1999, says there have been slight dips before, but the latest drop was much steeper and is likely to hold even after the economy recovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a survey of builders this month, his group found that 89% are building or planning smaller homes than they had been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kermit Baker, chief economist of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), also sees the shift toward smaller houses. He says it was obvious with high-end buyers even before the economic downturn and he expects it to continue with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a survey last April, the AIA found twice as many architects reporting a size decline rather than an increase. In 2006, the reverse was true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Affordability is a major problem," Ahluwalia says, and building smaller usually means cheaper. Also, he says, people are realizing as household size shrinks that they don't need big homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baker says there is less incentive to buy a bigger, more expensive home as the economy weakens, home prices fall and energy costs remain a concern. He says people are less likely to see a home as a good investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even high-end buyers, Baker says, are showing more interest in smaller, better-crafted homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People don't want to be wasteful," says JD Callander of <span class="companylink">Weichert Realtors</span>. She says they are concerned about utility costs and cleaning requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clients used to like the status of a big home, she says, but "those days are gone."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are up in Reno as prices have fallen, attracting buyers. But the local housing market has not turned around. The existing housing market has a deep hole to climb out of, says Wayne Capurro, president of the Reno/Sparks Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the subprime mortgage collapse, Las Vegas grabbed national attention because sales and prices plunged so far. But Reno and its twin city, Sparks, also suffered housing turmoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Because our heyday was more overheated than most of the other cities in the country, perhaps except Las Vegas, now we are going through a much steeper decline in housing than the rest of the country," Capurro says. From their peak, prices have plummeted 40%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six months ago, local real estate agents thought home prices had bottomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We didn't predict that the median price would go down 27% just in the past year alone," Capurro says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local market has about a 13-month supply of homes for sale. In general, six months of inventory is considered a more balanced market between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although many home buyers may want to take advantage of the low prices, they may not qualify for a mortgage. Jumbo loan qualifications are much more stringent these days, so few homes of more than $500,000 are selling, Capurro says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just when the local housing market might have begun to bounce back, the economy nose-dived. In Reno, where there is very little building going on, the unemployment rate in the construction industry has risen, hurting other businesses that feed off of it, says Thomas Cargill, a professor of economics at the University of Nevada-Reno.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The metro area includes manufacturing, high-tech and service- oriented businesses, so Reno's economy is not entirely reliant on gambling and tourism. Last year Inc. magazine named Reno/Sparks the eighth-best midsize city for job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can actually live here and not be aware that there is gambling going on," Cargill says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job diversification makes for a better shock absorber when times are tough, he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales in Fort Worth were down drastically in October compared with a year ago. But it's not as bad as it seems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike many other parts of the nation, the housing market in the Fort Worth metro area was still sailing along in 2006 and 2007. "Our declines now are being magnified because they're measured against peak conditions," says James Gaines, an economist at Texas A&amp;M University's Real Estate Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though home sales are down, the average time that homes are on the market is about six months, Gaines says. "That indicates a relatively strong market," he says. In addition, the Fort Worth market has never been overly inflated, as have other parts of the nation. Prices haven't skyrocketed, followed by extreme drops, says real estate agent Pamela Payne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The metro area is considered affordable. The median home price is now down a bit, so despite the national financial storm, home buyers are moving ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm very busy," Payne says. "I'm probably doing better this year than the year before."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong local economy has helped spur home sales. "The oil and gas boom has been a blessing here," says Helen Collins-Epps, president of the Greater Fort Worth Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the energy industry is still doing well, Gaines predicts that it's likely to hit a snag in the next 12 to 14 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices may be a good deal, but home sales have fallen because buyers now need a down payment and a good credit score to get a mortgage. It's also more difficult for them to get jumbo financing to buy a high-price home, Gainer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, investors are buying fewer homes, and building has slowed. "It's going to be an unsettled time, but hopefully by the end of 2009, this market will gradually start going back up again," Collins- Epps says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is one thing in Fort Worth's favor. It remains a popular place to live and raise a family. As Payne puts it: "People enjoy Fort Worth because it's laid back, and there is a bit of Southern charm."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued their free fall nationwide in September, and economists say foreclosures and tight credit will continue to keep the market down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a single-family home in September was down 17.4% from September 2007 and down 21.8% from the peak in July 2006, according to the widely followed <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index of 20 metropolitan areas. Prices dropped 1.8% from August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop from last September for the 20-city index was a record for the 8-year-old index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cities with the biggest annual declines were Phoenix, down 31.9%; Las Vegas, down 31.3%; and San Francisco, down 29.5%. Los Angeles, Miami and San Diego followed with prices down 25% or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moderate annual drops were reported for cities such as New York, down 7.3%; Boston, down 5.7%; Charlotte, down 3.5%; and Dallas, down 2.7%. Detroit, down 18.6% from last September, remains the only city in the index in which a house costs less today than it did in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The decline overall in September was greater than expected, and it will be in that level for a while," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. "With the tighter credit standards, less money available, we're likely to see three or four more months of not very good numbers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naroff said it was unclear how much of the price drops were buyers flocking to foreclosures and short sales because that's where the deals are. "That overestimates the true extent of the decline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is a pretty gloomy report," said Karl Case, a professor of economics at Wellesley and the co-founder of the Case-Shiller index that bears his name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case said that two markets are developing in these metro areas: an auction market, or those bank-owned properties sold after foreclosure, and a traditional market, in which an owner sells to a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It does look like the traditional market, despite all the gloom, is holding its own better than I might have thought," Case says. Rising unemployment, a major predictor of mortgage delinquency and subsequent foreclosures, and credit so tight that employed and qualified people can't get a loan, means, "there is a lot of fear out there that has yet to hit these numbers," Case says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is tempting to blame the faster drop in September on the chaos in the financial markets, which would have had an impact on consumer sentiment, said Ian Shepherdson, U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics, in a statement. But prices do not respond to credit problems immediately, so, "We have to be braced for even bigger price declines through the fall and winter; no bottom in sight," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales tumbled in October and prices continued a precipitous decline not seen since 1968, indicating there is scant sign of a turnaround in the housing market despite aggressive federal intervention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report Monday by the National Association of Realtors found that home sales dropped 3.1%, from a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.14 million in September to 4.98 million in October -- a much larger decline than many economists had predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices had their largest year-over-year drop on record. The median price for an existing home in October fell 11.3% from a year ago, to $183,300 -- the lowest median sale price since March 2004. Economists expect the grim report to be followed by further declines in sales and prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors imperil a turnaround this year and possibly next:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Climbing unemployment is putting home purchases out of reach of more Americans. A sign of the trend: Mortgage applications dropped 15% in October and are on track to fall a similar percentage in November, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data. "The credit crunch will result in declining sales through the end of the year," says economist Patrick Newport of IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Rising foreclosures mean more housing inventory, which puts downward pressure on prices. There were 4.23 million unsold homes on the market in October. Roughly 165,000 Americans lost their homes in September and October, bringing the total to 936,000 since August 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More mortgage defaults are likely. At least $500 billion worth of option-adjustable-rate-mortgage loans are expected to reset from mid- 2009 through 2012, further raising the risk of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth has nearly doubled from the 6.6 million who were underwater at the end of 2007, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. Most are homeowners who bought between late 2003 and 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are projected to drop on average another 10%, bringing to an estimated 14.6 million the number of homeowners who will be underwater on their mortgages by fall 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the NAR report, home prices fell across most of the USA. Home sales were down in the Northeast (-5.5%), the South (- 4.3%) and the Midwest (-14.4%), but up in the West (+6.1%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data show that President-elect Barack Obama and Treasury secretary nominee Timothy Geithner face a formidable task once they take office in determining how best to use some of the remaining $700 billion financial-rescue fund to help homeowners with troubled mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors says that Treasury should "actually start buying the mortgage paper from the banks, which was the original intention of the $700 billion bailout plan. Once the government owns the mortgages, they can then restructure them, allow a moratorium or do whatever they want."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in foreclosures continued to drive down the median price of homes across the country in the third quarter, according to a report released by the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect the fourth quarter to be worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 35% and 40% of all transactions were either foreclosures or pre-foreclosure sales -- called short sales -- in the quarter, the report says, causing the national median price of a single- family home to drop to $200,500, 9% lower than the third quarter of 2007 and 11.9% off the peak of the housing boom, in the third quarter of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Homes are selling because prices are plunging," said Patrick Newport, economist at Global Insight. "Prices are plunging because of distressed sales."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While existing home sales dropped from the third quarter of 2007 in the South and the Northeast by 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively, the number of sales jumped 13.1% in the West and 2.7% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It isn't a sign that it is a healthy market," Newport said. "It is just a sign that banks are foreclosing on homes and slashing prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Naroff, of Naroff Economic Advisors, disagrees. "People look at it as being bad. I see it as being good. The foreclosures and short sales are getting prices to where they belong." Sales jumped the most in Nevada, up 76%; California, 58.4%; and Arizona, 49.4%. All were among the five states with the highest number of foreclosure filings in October, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The areas that saw the largest price declines were the areas hardest hit by high numbers of foreclosures: Riverside/San Bernardino/Ontario, Calif., down 39.4%; Sacramento/Arden-Arcade/ Roseville, Calif., down 36.8%; and San Diego/Carlsbad/San Marcos, Calif., down 36%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some areas saw modest price gains, including Buffalo, up 3%, Tulsa, up 5.1%, and Wichita, up 5.5%. But prices dropped in the majority of the 152 metropolitan areas included in the survey. Also on Tuesday, a closely followed home-builder index recorded its lowest level of confidence in the industry since it was created in January 1985. The National Association of Home Builders/<span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> housing market index, which peaked at 72 in mid-2005, was at 9 on Tuesday. The index reflects home builders' view of new home sales now and in the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They've thrown in the towel," Naroff says. "We look for capitulation in the stock market, we've gotten it in the home builders' market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He predicts the worst economic numbers will come in the fourth quarter. Newport agrees: "The economy really changed on Sept. 15 when <span class="companylink">Lehman Bros</span>. went bankrupt. That's when credit came to a halt."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ventura, a California beach town, is coping with the winds of change. Just last month, its home sales were climbing back up, while its home prices were tumbling down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now Ventura's housing market, like the rest of the nation, is suddenly in a holding pattern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the last several weeks we've had all the uncertainty in the market and so everybody just stops in their place," says Dale King, president of the Ventura County Coastal Association of Realtors. "But the coastal areas recover quickly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one thing, there is a limited amount of oceanfront properties and they are coveted, says Janet Caminite, a real estate agent at <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>. "And so the property seems to retain a lot of its value," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further inland, housing development in the Ventura area is restricted. The controlled growth prevents home building from taking much land out of agriculture and hillsides, King says. "As a result, the existing housing supply becomes more precious and it tends to put a floor under prices," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It doesn't mean that Ventura has been exempt from the housing crisis and the surge in home foreclosures. Even though foreclosure rates started to decline in September, Ventura had the 15th-highest rate among the country's metro areas, according to Realtytrac.com. It was behind seven other California metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The majority of the foreclosures in Ventura stemmed from 2004 and 2005, according to King. "That was when prices were peaking and lenders were making incredibly exotic loans," such as subprime loans, he says. "Lenders were trying to loosen up their programs to just get people in any way, shape or form. There was also fraud that took place because people were vulnerable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that prices have come down substantially, many first-time buyers can afford a home. And compared with other coastal areas, such as Santa Barbara, the homes in the Ventura area are more affordable, Caminite says. "It's an up-and-coming area," she says. "A lot of people from Los Angeles who don't want the congestion and the smog are moving north to Ventura."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the high end of the market continues to sell, even if somewhat slowly, King says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local realty agents expect Ventura home sales will rebound fairly quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the last month I've gotten a lot of calls from prospective home buyers," Caminite says. "They are not writing offers right now, but the fact that they are inquiring is a good sign."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued to fall in August, and economists and housing experts say that more declines are likely before the market stabilizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a single-family home in August was 16.6% lower than in August 2007 and has fallen 20.3% from the price peak in July 2006, according to the widely followed <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/ Case-Shiller index of 20 metropolitan areas. Prices dropped only 1% from July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline from the year before was a record fall for the 8- year-old index of 20 cities, and it was the fifth-consecutive month that all of the cities saw price declines from the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those with the biggest annual drops were Phoenix and Las Vegas, with prices falling more than 30% from last August. Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego all had price declines of more than 25% from last August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the steep declines in those areas are countered by more moderate annual price drops in areas such as Dallas and Charlotte, which are down only 2.7% and 2.8%, respectively, from August 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the year-to-year declines, two cities, Cleveland and Boston, saw prices rise slightly from July to August. Boston has had price increases from the month prior in each of the last five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Affordability is coming back into markets all across the country," says Joel Naroff, an economist at Naroff Economic Advisors. "That should generate additional sales and stabilize prices. If only people could get mortgages. The biggest impediment in the market is the ability to get mortgages."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He anticipates a further drop of only 5% to the bottom. "Peak to trough I don't see us dropping 30% by any means," Naroff says. "I could see 25%, but I wouldn't be surprised if we don't get that much."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other experts forecast a steeper fall from the peak, with a remaining 10% or more decline coming slowly into next year and beyond. From the top to the bottom, "Expect a total fall of 30%," says Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we have incremental declines every month, it will take until 2010 to reach the total 30% drop," says Suzanne Mistretta of Fitch Ratings. She adds that the run-up in prices from 2004 to the peak in 2006 has been unwound and prices are currently at 2004 levels. She expects prices will go lower, down to 2003 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The monkey wrench in all this is the possibility of worsening macroeconomic conditions and jobs," she says. The 30% drop from the peak, "doesn't take into account significant deterioration in the economy."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September sales of new homes rose 2.7% from August, but economists and housing experts say the turmoil in the financial markets makes it too soon to declare a bottom to the housing market's downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family new construction fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 464,000, down about a third from the pace in September 2007, the Commerce Department reported Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The August to September gain was driven by strong results in the West, where sales jumped about 23% on the strength of some of the biggest price cuts by home builders anywhere in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report said that the national median price for a new home was $218,400, down from a median price of $221,900 in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales numbers in September "were only up because they were down so much in August," says Patrick Newport, an economist for Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report on new home sales followed the National Association of Realtors' report Friday showing that existing home sales rose 5.5% in September from August and 1.4% from a year earlier. Existing home sales include foreclosed properties, and the two reports illustrate the impact of falling prices on home sales overall, Newport says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Newport says, new home sales in the western part of the U.S. were down 37.9% from September 2007, while existing home sales there were up 34.4% from September 2007, according to the NAR .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What that tells me is that builders can't sell new homes because banks are foreclosing on existing homes," he says. "A builder can't cut his price too much, because he has to cover costs, but a bank can cut the price on the property until it sells. With tumbling home prices, builders can't live in that market. It is happening everywhere, but it is highlighted in the West."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing number of foreclosures, particularly in states such as California and Nevada, continue to push down prices of all homes, including new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent Fitch Ratings report said prices have fallen about 22% from their 2006 peak, but another 10% decline is likely before prices stabilize in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is very hard for a new home builder to compete with a foreclosed property," says Bernard Markstein, senior economist at the National Association Home Builders. "It seems clear that existing home sales have been increased due to foreclosures, and that is good because you're moving them off the market and getting people into them," he says. "The bad part is that it tends to depress prices more than is warranted."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of September, there were 394,000 new homes for sale nationally, down from 425,000 in August but still more than a 10- month supply at the current selling rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we could get down to 350,000 or 300,000 we'll be in much better shape," Markstein says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October new homes sales are likely to be weak, but some recovery is expected in November and December, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If people shrug off the stock market, we'll be on the path to recovery," Markstein says. "If it takes a couple more months and people are still saying, 'I'm not buying a house,' we've got another step down to go."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've heard a lot of people talking about the stock market and the economy," says Marolyn Pryor, president of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Association of Realtors. "But right now, they don't seem to be that upset." In September, Oklahoma City's home sales were up from a year earlier. And so far this month, "We're doing fine, and people are still buying homes and moving up," Pryor says. The only area that has slowed down a bit is the sale of high-end homes, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are down. "Some builders are reducing prices to get rid of their inventory," Pryor says. "They may be a little nervous about what is happening on the national level."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But overall, the housing market in Oklahoma City has remained in good shape because it never had a speculative boom, and home prices have remained relatively low. Home sales are rising, in part, because of the strong local economy and job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Oklahoma as a state is doing particularly well, and Oklahoma City is the standout," says Mark Snead, research economist at Oklahoma State University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has long been known as a gas and oil producer, and that still provides an economic boost. But there isn't a single-industry story in Oklahoma City, Snead says. The area now is broadly diversified. "It is finally hitting its stride, and it looks like a typical metropolitan area," Snead says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, in addition to oil and gas companies, it's home to the military aviation industry, such as Tinker Air Force Base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder that Forbes.com this year named Oklahoma City as the top recession-proof city in America. It said that the city's falling unemployment and strong housing market are reasons why "it looks best positioned of the nation's metropolitan areas to ride out the current crisis."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STOCKTON, Calif. -- Two years ago, Sharon Halligan drove from Kentucky to California lamenting that she couldn't afford a home in the high-priced state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her job search brought her here, and she rented. Then the 61- year-old Halligan watched prices tank as the subprime lending mess engulfed home after home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, the human resources manager moved into her $260,000 two-story home in Stockton after losing seven other bids on foreclosed homes. Thirty months ago, her new house appraised for $608,000. "Isn't it amazing?" she says, standing next to her U- Haul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stockton, a boom-and-bust town hit early and hard by the nation's foreclosure crisis, is digging out of the financial excesses of its past. Here, two hours from the San Francisco Bay Area, more than 7,500 homes and condominiums have been lost to foreclosure since the end of 2006, says real estate researcher MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>. The glut has cut median home prices by more than half, spurring multiple offers on foreclosed homes and record sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the city's hangover is likely to be a doozy. Its experience mirrors that of other U.S. cities devastated by foreclosures and underscores that recovery from the national mortgage and credit crisis will be painful for many people but filled with opportunity for some.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter alone, one in 25 Stockton homes received a foreclosure notice, one of the highest rates in the nation, researcher RealtyTrac says. Some blocks have been so depopulated that even the Saturday afternoon jingle of an ice cream truck is greeted with silence. The telltale signs of homeownership gone bust? Brown lawns dying in the Central Valley heat and black lockboxes dangling from front doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We used to have block parties," says Stockton homeowner Anitra Deramous, 47, a hospice nurse. "We knew everybody. It used to be all homeowners. No more. The majority are renters now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stockton's city budget, which draws 43% of its funds from property and sales taxes, faces an 11% shortfall, necessitating "draconian" cuts, budget analyst Joe Maestretti told The Stockton Record newspaper this month. In September, the city's unemployment rate hit 12.4% vs. 8% for the same month two years earlier, when construction and finance jobs were plentiful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effect of so many foreclosures has seeped into other parts of the community. School enrollment is down 7% from 2006 in a district heavily affected by foreclosures and population dips. School closures are possible, says Jason Messer, acting superintendant of the Manteca Unified School District, which serves some of Stockton's population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Women's Center of San Joaquin County, which serves victims of domestic abuse, gets more calls of distress as bad finances and bad relationships collide, coordinator Tiffany Fields says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in another part of the city of 290,000, prayer groups field numerous requests to pray for those fearful of losing homes, says the Rev. Marc Maffucci of Quail Lakes Baptist Church.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In years past, we would go a long time before we had to pray for someone getting kicked out of their house," Maffucci says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures driving sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other U.S. cities hit hard by foreclosures are seeing many of the same trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, where RealtyTrac says foreclosure filings hit one in 75 homes in August, home prices have dropped 37% in the past two years. September home sales were torrid there, too. Almost three out of four involved foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices continue to inch down as foreclosed homes sell fast only to be replaced by new ones, says Patty Kelley, president of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cape Coral, Fla., the police and fire departments are bracing for staff cuts of 9% and 11%, respectively, due largely to lowered property tax revenue, spokesman Michael Jackson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southern California home sales in September were up 65% from the prior year. Half involved foreclosure resales, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> says. In the Bay Area, the September median price for homes and condos sold was 36% less than a year ago, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout California, the number of mortgage default notices -- the first step in the foreclosure process -- fell 22.5% in the third quarter from the second, due to a change in the state's foreclosure process, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Stockton, lenders are more willing now than in past months to redo loans for those who can't make monthly payments, says Stockton Realtor Laurie Hallquist of <span class="companylink">Prudential California Realty</span> Stockton. She says about 27% of current home sales are "short sales" in which, to avoid a costly foreclosure, lenders allow a home sale for less than what's owed and forgive the difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> says 2,128 Stockton homes were lost to foreclosure in the third quarter, up 18% from the quarter before. Statewide, no peak is in sight for foreclosures until early next year, says the California Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of Stockton's now-empty homes were owned and occupied by Bay Area workers. Others were bought by investors as rental properties. Buyers gobbled up homes because they were cheaper than in the Bay Area and showed strong gains. At the same time, lending terms were generous, and housing stock was ample.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Stockton's boom years of 2003, 2004 and 2005, home builders constructed almost 8,000 homes in the city -- an amount equal to 11% of its single-family-home inventory. Home prices soared 25% from the end of 2004 to the end of 2005 alone, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> says. Lenders required no money down, sometimes handing out loans for 100% to 105% of the home's value, says Hal Lurtsema, president of <span class="companylink">Prudential California Realty</span> Stockton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When home prices soared, many owners refinanced and spent the proceeds. When prices got so high that new buyers stopped coming, they started to tank. Many owners ended up owing more than their homes were worth. "The vast majority of people in foreclosure had no money in and had money out," Lurtsema says. "The whole thing was crazy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowner Deramous was caught in the frenzy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband relocated to Stockton from the Bay Area in 2000, buying a 2,400-square-foot home for $176,000. As home values soared, so did their spirits. The house appraised for $500,000 in 2006. They refinanced, took money out for a new car, vacations and other expenses. Now, they owe more than $300,000, and the house "is probably worth $176,000 again," Deramous says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was foolish of us," she says. "My parents never took money out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deramous hopes their lender will lower their payments. It already has agreed to keep their interest rate at 7% vs. the 9% it could go to, she says. Foreclosure would wreck their credit. "We did borrow the money," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down the street, Manuel Leighton, 63, stands behind the white picket fence he built around his yard. He and his first wife bought the home in 1998. The next year, his wife of 36 years died at home of breast cancer. Leighton remarried. Near the peak of the market, the house was appraised for $465,000. He and his wife refinanced three times in almost six years, each time taking out cash to pay for a pool that never got built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Leighton laments the loss of his better judgment and that he owes $390,000 on a house worth far less. A house next door recently sold at auction for $265,000, he says. "That hurts me," he says. "I'm going to call my lender and see if they'll redo my loan. If they can't, I may end up walking."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A silver lining for some</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this is evident to Paula Pelzl, 24, a stay-at-home mom, and biotech employee Troy Avidano, 29, of San Jose. Gripping a list of eight foreclosed homes that they checked out online, the couple recently scanned the outside of a foreclosed home in Stockton's Weston Ranch subdivision, a favorite with Bay Area commuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They hope to buy their first home for less than $200,000. Despite drops in Bay Area home prices, a similar property there would still be about $600,000, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a good time to buy. We got lucky," Pelzl says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Pekarek, 27, didn't get lucky the first time around, but he hopes to on the second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The civil engineer bought a house in Modesto, 25 miles south of Stockton. He bought with a friend, who was also an engineer, for $425,000. They paid no money down and got a five-year, interest- only loan. Their plan was to live in the house for two years, sell it and make a little profit. The only problem? They bought at the top of the market, and the home is now worth about $225,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Convinced that real estate in California's Central Valley will once again be a good investment, Pekarek and his fiancee recently bought a foreclosed house in Stockton for $170,000 from lending giant <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>. Pekarek hopes to negotiate with a different bank to unload his Modesto home without going into foreclosure, or keep it as a rental property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's also considering buying another foreclosed property in the area with his cousin. To finance it, he knows they'll need at least 20% down, given tightened standards by lenders. To get that, he may tap his 401(k).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You win some. You lose some. I just happened to buy at the top of the market," he says. "Now I have to buy back in at the bottom."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent jump in mortgage rates could jeopardize any turn-around in the housing market as home buyers face steeper loan costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage this week hit 6.46%, up from 5.94% last week, mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly half-point increase is the biggest weekly jump since 1987. On a $165,000 loan, a borrower would pay $1,069 monthly, or $58 more than the payment on the same loan taken out last week. Despite the big jump, the 30-year rate is about where it was as recently as mid-August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales nationally have increased as prices have declined, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported last week. But escalating mortgage rates are eroding some of the growing affordability that has come from dropping home prices, say economists such as Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the USA's housing market remains well below its 2006 peak in both sales volumes and prices paid. According to the most recent data from NAR, the pace of home sales in August was 11% below the year-ago level. The median sales price of $198,100 in August was down 9.5% from a year earlier, and the USA had more than a 10-month supply of homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naroff and others cite the federal government's bank rescue plan as a key reason for the recent jump in mortgage interest rates. The government's $700 billion rescue plan means the Treasury is borrowing more money, putting pressure on long-term interest rates for mortgage securities -- the source of most capital for home finance. That, coupled with investors' fears about future inflation, means rates could continue to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another feature of the rescue plan may also be affecting mortgages. The government has agreed to guarantee bank debt. As a result, investors who had previously bought mortgage debt issued by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> debt are investing in bank debt, which now seems safer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big jump in mortgage rates mirrors recent volatility in Treasury securities. The 10-year Treasury, a benchmark for fixed- rate mortgages, was yielding about 4% Thursday, up from 3.5% early last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some economists say rates should stabilize as fears over the economy recede and markets become less volatile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I suspect what we're seeing right now is the worst of it. I'm predicting the financial panic will abate some," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homeowners say they believe the federal bailout is unfair and could backfire if it continues to make the cost of home financing rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Hogan, 30, of Columbus, Ohio, recently refinanced from an adjustable-rate loan to a fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage at 6%, and says he's concerned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People have been spoiled with low rates, and with higher rates they won't refinance or purchase. And we're paying to help bail other people out," says Hogan, who works in advertising.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the financial meltdown, it seemed that Denver's housing market was finally about to turn around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Denver's home sales in August were down from a year ago, there have been a number of positive signs. "We have less inventory right now," says William Roberts, president of the Denver Board of Realtors. "There are more buyers, and the interest rates are fairly low."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are unlikely to go any lower, says Gary Bauer, an independent real estate broker. Recently, there has been some bidding, and home buyers have paid more than the asking price, Roberts says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a good sign after such a long housing slump. In 2006, after the housing market started to bottom out, Denver's foreclosure rate was among the highest in the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It hit us first," Bauer says. "And we've been aggressive at working with homeowners, and we worked our way through that." For example, the city set up a foreclosure-assistance hotline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Denver metro area encompasses seven counties, and there are a number of very popular and stable neighborhoods, such as Cherry Creek and LoDo, the lower downtown area of the city where there are many lofts. In some other areas, though, sales were hard hit because homes were overbuilt like crazy, Roberts says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, home inventory is 25% less than a year ago, and the Mile High City's local economy is in good shape, Bauer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denver is known for energy and aerospace industries. It is also expanding into alternative energy, including two new plants by <span class="companylink">Vestas Wind Systems</span>, which will bring about 1,300 jobs, according to Metro Denver Economic Development Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, everything suddenly has hit a major snag. Denver's job growth has slowed because of the national economy. Consumer confidence has been the lowest in years, and that's what's most holding back the housing market, Bauer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No one knows what is going on in the market, and they are just going to sit and wait," he says. One of Bauer's clients, a young Denver couple, had been shopping for a home but instead decided to rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the bailout helps rescue the national economy, Denver's housing market may be able to restart. "We have such a strong position with our economy," Roberts says. "Hopefully, we should be able to lead the nation out of the housing recession."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big-city home prices in July were down 16.3% from a year earlier, but the decline in prices appears to be slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city housing index released Tuesday showed the largest 12-month decline since it began in 2000. Home values in all 20 cities fell year-over-year. Las Vegas and Phoenix reported year-over-year declines of nearly 30%. Miami reported a decline of 28.2% from July 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the peak of the housing market in mid-2006, the 20-city price index has fallen 19.5%, according to <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new report shows a slowing pace of declines that may hint at stabilization in some markets: During the May-July period, home prices fell about 2.2%. That's far less than February through April, when prices declined by more than 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Denver and Minneapolis all reported price increases during the May-July period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's positive and reflects that we saw a surge in foreclosure sales in the beginning of the year," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. As more of those homes move off the market, the rate of price declines is slowing, he says. About 20% of the market is foreclosure sales, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said the slowing pace of price declines may indicate some stabilization in the market. "Pockets of the country have turned around," says Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have been searching for signs that the steep drop in housing prices over the last two years is slowing. Price declines are leaving more homeowners owing more for their properties than they could sell them for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a problem because people had been using homes for a source of funding through home equity. Now they can't do that," says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. "Their spending is going to go down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index follows other recent reports showing the housing slump has yet to turn around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said last week that the median sales price of an existing home in August was $203,100, down 9.5% from a year earlier. That was the largest 12-month decline since 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home fell to $221,900 in August, down 5.5% from a year earlier, the Commerce Department also said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also last week, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight reported a 5.3% decline in home prices nationally during the 12 months ended in July. OFHEO bases its calculation on home sales in which government-chartered investors <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> were involved.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staten Island is close to Manhattan, yet it seems like another world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its streets are not surrounded by towering skyscrapers or crowded by tourists and workers in a hurry. Instead, it has quiet, family- oriented neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's Camelot," says John Vernazza, president-elect of Staten Island Board of Realtors. "We've got diverse communities, and we're just 20 minutes from Manhattan. The Staten Island Ferry is a staple of New York City, and it never stops running."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staten Island is also one of the least-expensive places to buy a home in New York City, says Herman Herrera, real estate agent. And families can buy a home with a backyard, instead of a co-op or condominium apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have the proximity to Manhattan, but we have a suburban feel," Herrera says. "We have the best of both worlds."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the appeal, Staten Island's housing market has been suffering. "Sales are down because of the whole national economy," says real estate agent Tony Whalen. "People are losing their jobs. And the banks have tightened their belts."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Staten Island has not experienced the kind of mortgage crisis that has hit other parts of the nation. Home foreclosures there are not out of the ordinary. "In general, we're doing OK," Vernazza says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People aren't sure if the financial meltdown on Wall Street will cause home sales to fall even more in Staten Island. It is not home to many top financial executives, but there are high-end neighborhoods, where the homes cost $1million or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No matter what happens to the economy, people still have to live someplace," Vernazza says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market many not fall much more in Staten Island, but it also may not climb back up any time soon. "I think we can use a price adjustment," Whalen says. "It had gotten out of hand, and until now it was hard for young couples to buy a home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staten Island is generally home to middle-class families, such as police officers, firefighters, teachers and secretaries. In the 1988 movie Working Girl, actress Melanie Griffith played a secretary from Staten Island who worked for a Manhattan brokerage firm.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in August were a record 9.5% lower than a year earlier, but the lower prices lured more buyers, shrinking the backlog of unsold homes and raising hopes that the housing market might be close to turning the corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price nationwide was $203,100 vs. $224,400 a year ago, the National Association of Realtors said. The percentage drop was steepest in the West at 24%. Prices dipped 3.4% in the South, 5.6% in the Midwest and 3.8% in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're back to a level of affordability we haven't seen in three years," says Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors. "We've wiped out a good portion of the (housing) bubble."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price plunge largely reflects fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis, with nearly 40% of homes on the market in foreclosure or sold for less than the mortgage value, the Realtors group says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news: Fire sale prices are attracting buyers, especially in the West and Southeast. Sales nearly doubled in California markets such as San Diego, Sacramento and Riverside, as well as in Las Vegas and Fort Myers, Fla. That helped slash the number of unsold homes at the end of August by 7% to 4.3 million, or a 10.4- month supply, down from 10.9 months in July. That's still much higher than a typical six-month supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At least it's moving in the right direction," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the NAR, adding he expects the trend to continue the rest of the year. "The only way to get price stabilization is to get the inventory down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another sign the market may be bottoming, Naroff says, is that home sales in August fell only 2.2% from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.9 million. Sales the past 10 months generally have been stable, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, only a limited number of buyers are taking advantage of the moderating prices because of tight lending criteria and higher interest rates, especially from <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. The government takeover of the mortgage finance giants should ease credit standards and attract more buyers, Yun says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Yun and Naroff predicted home prices could fall another 5% or so this year before mounting a rebound early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, is less sanguine. He notes that the shrinking inventory can largely be traced to fewer home listings because of the weak market. He doesn't see a turnaround until "well into 2009."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A growing number of Americans are struggling to pay for housing, despite a steep drop in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, 38% of homeowners with mortgages spent 30% or more of their before-tax income on housing -- the threshold the government defines as unaffordable, according to an analysis of Census data done for USA TODAY by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And 15% of homeowners without mortgages and half of all renters had trouble meeting housing costs, the analysis found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan McCue, a research analyst at the Joint Center, said the number of households straining to pay for housing grew despite "serious price declines" in real estate across the USA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price slumped 7.1% to $212,400 from July 2007 to July 2008, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the largest 100 metro areas, Miami-Fort Lauderdale had the highest percentage of cash-strapped homeowners with mortgages. Nearly six out of 10 homeowners with mortgages there are spending 30% or more of their income on housing. Stockton, Calif.; Riverside- San Bernardino, Calif.; Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Fla.; and Los Angeles- Long Beach round out the top five.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 13 of the largest metro areas, at least half of homeowners with mortgages spent 30% or more of their income on housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of those markets are also in areas of the country hit hardest by the recent wave of home foreclosures as the value of real estate -- which soared during the housing bubble -- collapsed in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCue says the growth of homeownership was halved from 2006 to 2007, while renting reversed itself and gained in popularity. "From 2005 to 2006, renting went down by almost a quarter of a million households. It went up by almost as many from 2006 to 2007."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 75% of homeowners with household incomes under $50,000 struggled to pay their mortgages, vs. 23% of those who made more than $50,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners with mortgages and whose incomes were lower than $20,000 continued to struggle most. Nearly all spent at least 30% of their income on housing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Honolulu is far from the mainland, and the nation's mortgage crisis hasn't made many waves there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Honolulu's banks didn't invest in many subprime loans, says Rochelle Gregson, CEO of the Honolulu Board of Realtors. "Our business practices are conservative."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And home foreclosure hasn't been a major problem, either. In the second quarter, Honolulu's foreclosure rate was the lowest of 100 major metro areas, according to RealtyTrac.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Honolulu's housing market has fared much better than the mainland, its home sales have hit a snag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing that homes have more days on the market and fewer sales," says Margy Grosswendt, a real estate agent. "The prices are definitely not rising unless it's a spectacular product."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, homes were on the market for about five days, Gregson says. Now, they tend to stay on the market 30 days, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation has shaken the confidence of home buyers. "The fuel prices have affected our lives," Gregson says. "It not only affects our driving habits, but it also affects the cost of goods, such as food and produce, because everything is shipped in."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And although Honolulu is known for a strong local economy with good job growth, this year it was hit by the shutdown of <span class="companylink">Aloha Airlines</span>. That affected nearly 2,000 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least Honolulu's high-end market, which they consider prices of $4 million or more, hasn't slowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"High-net-worth individuals want to diversify out of the stock market and into trophy real estate," says Grosswendt, who specializes in the high-end market. "It's like a very fine piece of art, and jewelry." High-end homes have been attracting investors from Australia and Japan, as well as the mainland, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area remains popular due to a mild climate, beautiful beaches and big-wave surfing. And the city of Honolulu is cosmopolitan, with museums, restaurants and an opera theater. It has several highly regarded private schools. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, who was born in Honolulu, attended Punahou school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're very vibrant, we have clean air and water, and we have a friendly aloha spirit," Grosswendt says. "Even when the market slows, we know that it will come back."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New housing reports out Tuesday show some of the first glimmers of stabilization in the troubled housing market, but economists say there are still significant risks that could undermine a recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices fell at a slow pace for the fourth-consecutive month in June, with prices in 20 major metro areas down 0.5% for the month. The decline is far less than the 2% monthly drops seen earlier in 2008, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price index. And, in June, prices in nine of the 20 metro areas measured showed a gain from the preceding month, up from seven metros in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The bottom of the national housing market is in view," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "The rate of (price) decline is slowing, and there are signs of stabilization in some markets." But troubles persist. The decline in home prices year- over-year remained in the double digits, with prices a record 15.4% lower in the second quarter of 2008 than in the second quarter of 2007. From the housing market peak two years ago, the index report said, housing prices are off 18.8% in the 20 cities measured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices still down, but not everywhere</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data released Tuesday also show the market remains weak. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight reported that home prices nationally were 1.4% lower in the April-June quarter of 2008 vs. the preceding quarter, and down 4.8% from a year earlier. OFHEO analyzes prices paid nationwide for residences financed through <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Commerce, new homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 515,000. That rate is up 2.4% from June but is 35% below the July 2007 sales rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists remained generally upbeat about the reports, noting that several factors suggest the worst may soon be over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some regions, for example, are seeing home prices rise again. Those areas, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller report, include Denver, Boston, Charlotte and Dallas. Prices were up in some areas by 1.5% from May to June. OFHEO says prices increased in 12 states over the 12-month period ended June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market is weak on one hand, but we are in the process of hitting bottom. That's the true story," says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But any recovery is perilous. Inventories of unsold homes are still high, which could drag down prices. In a report Monday, the National Association of Realtors said the USA had 4.7 million unsold homes in July, the highest number in 40 years of tracking. That inventory would take more than 11 months to sell at the current rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates for a 30-year home loan have risen about half a percentage point since May. Those rates -- now in the 6.5% range -- could hamper any turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, lenders could continue to maintain tightened credit standards or clamp down even more, lessening the ability of potential buyers to get loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other variables include the job market and energy prices, which play into buyer confidence and the ability to afford a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, in light of recent housing reports, economists such as Brian Bethune now say it's a good time to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The evidence is starting to accumulate that things are starting to turn around," says Bethune, an economist at Global Insight. "A number of major metro centers are showing signs of stabilization, and that is positive news."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its market in the doldrums, the Columbus Board of Realtors launched a campaign earlier this year to let home buyers know that "the grass is greener here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, they point out, the housing market should be put in perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're a stable market," says Greg Hrabcak, president of the Columbus Board of Realtors. "And we're affordable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Columbus is home to Ohio State University and Ohio state government. It's also the headquarters of <span class="companylink">Nationwide Insurance</span> and <span class="companylink">Limited Brands</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter, the Columbus metro area added 1,600 jobs - - a 0.2% increase at a time when the national employment rate fell 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Forbes.com said Columbus was the third-most stable city in the nation, after Seattle and Pittsburgh. Despite the good rating, Forbes noted that of 40 markets, Columbus was also the 17th worst market for mortgage delinquencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no wonder that the local economy hasn't been able to quickly recharge the housing market. Like other parts of Ohio, Columbus has suffered from the rise in home foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter of this year, the foreclosure rate was 39% higher than in the same period in 2007, according to RealtyTrac.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subprime lending and fraud contributed to the rise in foreclosures, says Art Russo, a real estate agent. "Mortgage brokers were giving loans to people who didn't qualify and didn't know what they were signing," he says. "And they charged an exorbitant amount of fees."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, there was an overbuilding of homes and condominiums. "We especially have been flooded with condos," Russo says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction industry is mired in gloom, and the forecasts for the future don't look much better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New housing starts fell 11% in July from June, to an annualized rate of 965,000 -- the lowest level since March 1991, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, an indicator of construction plans, fell to an annualized pace of 937,000, 17.7% below June and 32.4% lower than in July 2007. "The housing market is in a deep recession, and it is getting worse," Global Insight economist Patrick Newport told clients in a conference call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts were skewed by a rule change in New York, prompting builders to start projects earlier in the year. The change made the data in June higher than they would have been otherwise, and lower in July than they would have been otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newport estimates that 70% of the drop in housing starts in July was in the multifamily sector in the Northeast -- the area affected by the New York rule change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for single-family homes continued to suffer. Single- family starts slowed to an annualized 641,000 units in July, the lowest since 1991. Building permits for single-family homes slid to 584,000, the lowest rate since August 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Permits suggest that starts have some distance to come down yet," says David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. He thinks housing starts will bottom in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even do-it-yourselfers have been cutting back on major projects, says hardware giant <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span>. "We continue to experience weakness in spending for larger projects and more discretionary purchases," <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> CEO Robert Niblock said Monday on a conference call with analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today, nearly 90% of our stores are in markets experiencing year- over-year home price declines, and generally our weakest comps are in those markets that have experienced the greatest declines," Niblock said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> second-quarter earnings beat Wall Street expectations, but were still down 8% from the same period last year. Rival <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> said Tuesday that it expects sales to fall 5% for its 2008 fiscal year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken Goldstein, economist for The Conference Board, said the gloomy construction numbers might not be as bad as they look. "It's not good news, but it's not a catastrophe," he says. "We're seeing signs that housing is closer to bottoming than we were six months to a year ago."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greeley, a city known for cattle producing and meatpacking, has been hit hard by the foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, it struggled with one of the top foreclosure rates among the nation's largest metro areas, according to RealtyTrac. Last year, the city's filings remained high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even this year, Weld County, of which Greeley is the county seat and principal city, saw a 23% increase in foreclosure filings in the first half, vs. the first six months of 2007, according to the Colorado Division of Housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors help explain the meltdown. For one thing, home construction had escalated in recent years as the Greeley area came to be seen as more affordable than other cities, including Denver, which is about an hour away. Many buyers snapped up homes using adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), says Angell Fuchs, a mortgage lender with Home Team Lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many of those who relied on such loans apparently didn't fully understand the loans would reset at higher rates that they might not be able to afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During that period, in addition to local home buyers, many families with jobs in Denver and Fort Collins chose to buy homes in Greeley, often using ARMs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had a lot of people commuting," says John DeWitt, president of the Greeley Area Realtor Association. "Three years ago, about 30% of our citizens would wake up and go elsewhere to work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once payments on ARMs began rising, many homeowners couldn't pay their bills. Several bedroom communities, meantime, popped up closer to Denver, a trend that started to shrink the pool of buyers in Greeley, DeWitt says. At the same time, home sales slowed, and the number of foreclosures rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought we would come out of this cycle a bit sooner," DeWitt says. "But not only are home prices still falling," he says, gas prices have risen significantly, and "people can't afford to commute."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a glimmer of good news, though. In the past three months, sales of foreclosed properties have risen, and the number of days they've remained on the market has fallen, Fuchs says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the local economy remains strong. Last year, JBS of Brazil bought Swift, a beef processor, and reopened a second shift in Greeley, bringing about 1,300 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We still have growth," DeWitt says. "We have an awesome quality of life."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The magnitude of home foreclosures appears to be overwhelming the efforts of lenders to help distressed borrowers keep their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help stem the wave of foreclosures, some lenders have been easing the terms of loans, helping owners refinance or even letting homes be sold for less than the value of the mortgage -- called a "short sale." But so far, those efforts have had only modest success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest evidence was a report Thursday from RealtyTrac, which said banks last month repossessed nearly three times the number of homes that they did in July 2007. One in every 464 households received a foreclosure filing last month. Some experts say the epidemic has yet to crest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From July to December -- that will be the peak of the foreclosures," says Susan Wachter, a real estate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "Assuming there's no increase in interest rates and no decrease in GDP. If we get through that, we can avoid the darkest scenario."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in bank-owned foreclosed properties is also helping drag down the national median price of a single-family home. About one- third of current sales are either bank-owned or short-sale properties, the National Association of Realtors says. In the second quarter, the median price of a single-family home fell 7.6% from the same quarter of 2007, to $206,500 from $223,500, the NAR reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As people can't get a refinance or work out a deal with their lender, you get to the end of the road," says Dominic De Simone, a partner at Philadelphia law firm <span class="companylink">Ballard Spahr Andrews &amp; Ingersoll</span>. "Unfortunately, the end of the road is often foreclosure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government and non-profit groups have been working with lenders to help prevent foreclosures. Some distressed borrowers have had some success in easing the terms of their loans or setting repayment plans with lenders -- collectively referred to as "workouts." Yet the number of foreclosure filings is outpacing those efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hope Now, an alliance of mortgage counselors and lenders, says more than 181,000 workouts were done for at-risk homeowners in June; 522,000 were done in the second quarter of 2008. But also in June, 252,363 properties received foreclosure filings; in the second quarter, 739,714 did, RealtyTrac says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With area home sales and prices extending their fall, the Memphis real estate market looks pretty gloomy at the moment. Still, unlike, say, Las Vegas, Memphis never ran rampant with overbuilding during the housing boom. Unlike Detroit, it hasn't been dragged down by an ailing core industry. That's why, according to the Memphis Area Association of Realtors, it's fairly well-positioned to climb back out of the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Memphis is not a roller-coaster city," says Jules Wade, the association's executive vice president. "Our market just kind of moves along at a fairly steady pace -- nothing too fast and nothing too slow."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, Memphis has hardly been immune to the effects of the national mortgage crisis. Tightening credit standards have made it harder to buy a home, says Dennis Wilson, research associate professor at the Sparks Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Memphis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city also bears some of the bruises of the economic slowdown, which has caused many people to hesitate before buying homes and making other expensive purchases. With sales slowing, Memphis has been left with an overabundance of new homes on the market. Right now, Wade says, homes under $100,000 are selling faster than the higher-priced end of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the local economy remains in fairly good shape, the city should be poised to climb back out of the downturn in the mortgage market. Memphis, a transportation and distribution hub, is headquarters for <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> and runs a busy cargo airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also trying to stimulate the local music industry, says John Snyder, president of the Memphis Area Association of Realtors. This week, the city is celebrating Elvis Week, which includes a screening of a new DVD with footage of his life and career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the growth of the Memphis economy has been relatively slow on average, so the mortgage market isn't likely to snap back very quickly, Wilson says. "Memphis is not as volatile as some other areas of the country. But when it goes down, it is slower to recover."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there are signs that the market is at least heading in the right direction. The housing surplus is gradually starting to shrink, and a few sections of the city are showing some increases in sales prices, Wade says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it gives us some glimpse of hope," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a glimmer of hope in the neon city of Nevada, where home sales are starting to heat up after two dismal years. In fact, sales in Las Vegas have risen over the past six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank-owned foreclosed properties are setting the pace. With prices falling, the homes are grabbing attention. The median home price was $225,000 in June, down from a peak of $315,000 in June 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"About 60% of everything that is selling is foreclosed properties," says Patty Kelley, president of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors. "A feeding frenzy of buyers is coming in and picking up property at the 50 cents to 60 cents on the dollar that owners had paid for it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas was one of the first areas hit by the subprime mortgage collapse. In a city where many gamblers have lost their shirts in casinos, many investors and other home buyers lost their luck in the mortgage market. After the housing bubble burst, foreclosures rose quickly. Last year, Nevada posted the nation's highest state foreclosure rate, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unclear if the housing market has hit a true bottom and begun to reverse course for good. "We're not looking for things to rally vastly until the end of 2009," Kelley says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas is apparently in a local recession, says Keith Schwer, a professor of economics at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. The area, he says, has been hard hit by speculation and excessive supplies in the housing market. Even worse, fuel prices have battered the tourist-based city as airfares have increased and schedules have been reduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We may have been able to avoid a recession had it not been for the rise in energy prices," Schwer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the slowdown in the national economy is causing many Americans to hold back on buying a home, Las Vegas still enjoys an advantage. Many foreigners love to visit the city, and some are eager to take advantage of the lower prices and favorable currency exchange rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're getting a lot more people from Canada and other foreign countries who are able to pick up property that they can afford," Kelley says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local residents may also help lift the housing market after some new casinos open at the end of the year and in late 2009 and produce jobs, Schwer says. While Las Vegas may have been one of the first cities to suffer from the housing crisis, it now may lead the way out of the slump, he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued to drop in May, and economists warned that more declines are likely before the housing market turns around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a single-family home in May was 15.8% lower than in May 2007, according to the widely followed <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index of 20 metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the largest annual drop for the index since it was created eight years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, home prices are back to where they were in August 2004, and overall, there hasn't been a month-to month increase in prices for the index since August 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the second month in a row, all of the 20 cities saw price declines from the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets that had experienced the greatest increase in prices continued to decline the most, with the sharpest drops in Las Vegas, 28.4%; Miami, 28.3%; and Phoenix, 26.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data suggested hints of bright spots. Some cities saw prices stabilize on a monthly basis. From April to May, the index fell just 0.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This does signal the beginning of the end of this downturn," says Mark Zandi, chief economist for <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "We're in the sixth inning."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of the decline is slowly abating, Zandi says, and the worst of the downturn is over. Some cities have had small monthly gains and may have stabilized, he says. However, he adds, "Prices won't rise until the job market stabilizes and more credit is available."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-market Case-Shiller index has dropped 18.4% from its peak in July 2006. "It will probably be down about 30%, when it is all said and done," Zandi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In USA TODAY'S quarterly survey of leading economists, 85% predict that home prices won't hit bottom until 2009 or later. Sixty- three percent say the median home price will drop 16% or more from the peak of the market before stabilizing, and 18% of those say it will drop more than 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures are the driving force behind the price declines, says Patrick Newport, an economist at Global Insight. When demand falls off, he says, sellers typically do one of three things: let it sit on the market; take it off the market; or cut the price incrementally. "Now, you have banks slashing prices on homes," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large inventory is exacerbated by sellers' denial, says Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors. Sellers, he says, "don't want to accept that they have to drop their prices a little and then drop their prices a lot."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a great time to buy a home in Bend, Ore., a popular resort and retirement community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price peaked at $396,000 in May of 2007 and earlier this year hit a low of $270,000. Now the median price, at $315,000, is still a bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates also have been fairly low and buyers have a huge selection, says Tom Greene, president of the Central Oregon Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not many home buyers have been taking advantage of the lower prices. In fact, home sales in Bend have fallen. That's mostly due to the weak economy and worries that the country might tumble into a recession, Greene says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many people are fearful that they might lose their jobs," he says. And during tough times, he adds, families may hold off on buying a second home for vacations or retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, Bend's economy is based on more than just tourism. "That's a bright spot here," Greene says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bend has developed a diversified economy, says Roger Lee, executive director of Economic Development for Central Oregon. Although many are small companies, local businesses include health care providers, aircraft manufacturers, alternative energy companies and microbreweries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For a decade, the job creation has been in the annual 4% to 5% range, which is phenomenal," Lee says. That has recently dropped to 1% to 2%. "But the fact that there are still people moving here and that we do have job creation going on, that will help us eat up the home inventory that's out there," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greene predicts that Bend will rebound, because the features that drove up home prices before the housing market collapsed haven't changed. The city is in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains and is a gateway to outdoor sports -- from mountain biking and hiking to fishing and white-water rafting. Even those who aren't so energetic, Greene says, like to take scenic drives on Cascade Lakes Highway.</p>
