<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market takes center stage in this week’s economic news as the sector largely returns to normal after two months of hurricane-related volatility. Also coming are reports on consumer spending and business investment, and a final estimate of economic growth in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose sharply in October after hurricanes in Texas and Florida dampened construction activity the prior month. A more gradual rise in single-family starts is expected for November. But groundbreakings for multifamily buildings could fall substantially after an outsized 37% increase in October, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. All told, economists expect the Commerce Department on Tuesday to report a 3. 1% drop in housing starts to a still-solid seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1. 25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Fed raises rates, keeps forecast for 3 hikes in 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Real estate market exclusive: Here are top cities to buy and sell homes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales have experienced similar swings, with a weak storm-related showing in September followed by a surge the following month. More broadly, low inventories are expected to continue to constrain sales, Alexander says. Economists expect the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday to announce a 0. 8% rise in existing home sales to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5. 53 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U. S. economy has been on something of a tear lately. The Commerce Department revised up its estimate of third-quarter economic growth from 3% at an annual rate to 3. 3%, the best quarterly performance in three years. That followed a 3% gain in the second quarter and capped a six-month stretch that was also the best since 2004. For the final third-quarter reading on Thursday, economists expect Commerce to leave its 3. 3% estimate unchanged amid healthy and consumer and business spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Commerce provides a more recent snapshot &nbsp;of consumer spending in November. Strong job and income growth continue to support consumption gains, though a retreat in auto purchases is likely after a surge driven by car replacements in the hurricane zones, Alexander says. Economists predict consumer spending rose salad 0. 4% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment also has been growing smartly on a resurgent global economy and relatively weak dollar that makes U. S. exports less expensive for overseas customers. Economists expect Commerce to record a 0. 5% gain in capital goods orders excluding aircraft and defense - a proxy for business capital spending - as part of its report on durable goods orders and purchases in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales have been surprisingly strong in recent months despite the hurricane’s effects. But shortages of construction workers and available lots are likely to continue to crimp the market, Alexander says. &nbsp;Economists expect Commerce to record a 5. 1% drop in new home sales last month to a still sturdy seasonally adjusted annual rate of 650,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The workplace misconduct allegations that prompted an investigation into <span class="companylink">Carolina Panthers</span> owner Jerry Richardson include claims of sexual harassment and the alleged use of a racial slur toward an African-American scout, according to a&nbsp;Sports Illustrated&nbsp;report published Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sports Illustrated&nbsp;reported that at least four former Panthers employees have received monetary settlements from Richardson over the years, along with non-disclosure agreements&nbsp;prohibiting them from publicly discussing the allegations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Panthers announced Friday that they had opened an investigation into Richardson's conduct. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed to USA TODAY Sports on Sunday that the league has since taken control of the investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to&nbsp;Sports Illustrated, Richardson&nbsp;invited female employees to lunch and offer to fasten their seatbelts for them, reaching across their laps or grazing their breasts in the process. On Fridays, when employees were permitted to wear jeans, he would ask female employees to turn around so he could see their backsides, according to&nbsp;Sports Illustrated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The magazine also reported allegations that Richardson "had a special interest in female grooming," paying for female employees to get manicures or asking them if he could personally shave their legs, among other claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richardson also allegedly used a racial slur when speaking to an African-American scout who has since left the team, according to the&nbsp;Sports Illustrated&nbsp;report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following Sunday's 31-24&nbsp;victory over the Packers, Panthers coach&nbsp;Ron Rivera addressed the situation by remembering various acts of support by Richardson toward him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of you know I had a house fire and he was there for Stephanie and I, he was tremendous in supporting us,” Rivera told reports. “My brother passed and Mr. Richardson was there and helped me get to the funeral and back. … I don’t know what’s been written or what’s been said. All I know is what Mr. Richardson has been for me and that’s been very supportive. ”</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Women often can't avoid their harassers, who then use it against them</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO - Women who are subjected to unwanted sexual advances in the workplace say they can't afford to burn bridges and often wind up leaving a trail of friendly messages behind them -- continued contact that men later produce as evidence to dispute their accounts and cast doubt on their credibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This pattern, repeated in several high-profile business cases that have ousted men from perches of power this year, reflects the bind women routinely face in the workplace. More than half of all American women say they've been harassed on the job, but repercussions for men have been few.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You are not going to walk up and say: 'You are dead to me,'" says Aileen Lee, a partner with venture capital firm Cowboy Ventures who belongs to an informal network of female investors. "You could potentially do more damage to yourself and to your career."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, author and entrepreneur Laura Fitton had just left a fundraiser when she says venture capitalist Shervin Pishevar grabbed and forcibly kissed her in the hotel's elevator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fitton deterred Pishevar and later reprimanded the investor about his behavior. But nervous about alienating an influential business connection, she stayed in touch with Pishevar, whose early bets on Uber and <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> opened doors across Silicon Valley. Over the next few years, she sent friendly notes asking about his welfare and inviting him to speak at conferences in her role as a tech marketing influencer. Pishevar -- who resigned Thursday from his firm <span class="companylink">Sherpa Capital</span> -- has denied Fitton's allegations. He is now using those notes -- through his law firm -- as proof that he couldn't have done anything that wasn't consensual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yes I look at the messages I sent and cringe, but in the context of my job I felt I had to repair the relationship," Fitton told <span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, men have pointed to ongoing communication to refute the accounts of women. During Anita Hill's testimony in 1991 against Clarence Thomas, Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., hammered Hill on why she followed Thomas from one job to another and kept in touch with him instead of formally complaining about his behavior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hill explained she worried that deleting Thomas from her Rolodex would harm her career. "I was afraid of retaliation. I was afraid of damage to my professional life," Hill replied. "And this kind of response is not atypical."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is this myth that if you are really being harassed or assaulted, you will get angry and get the hell out of there," says Lilia Cortina, professor of psychology and women's studies at the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>. "People say: Why didn't she just report him? Why didn't she just leave? They don't understand all the complicated reasons why leaving is not an option."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco tech entrepreneurs Lindsay Meyer and Niniane Wang were two of six women who this summer accused venture capitalist Justin Caldbeck of sexual harassment in professional situations. Wang says Caldbeck tried to sleep with her when they met to discuss business, a charge she made public in an article in the technology news outlet The Information that forced Caldbeck to step down from his post running Binary Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Wang during a July tech conference alleged Caldbeck pressured the women and The Information's news reporter to shelve the article or face legal repercussions, he sent her a cease-and-desist letter threatening legal action. In it, Caldbeck also took issue with her contention in a Pando Daily article that he had tried to buy her silence by offering to fund her company. He pointed to a friendly email Wang sent him asking for a business favor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You had asked Justin a matter of weeks before the article to introduce you and your company, Evertoon, to Binary companies and followed up repeatedly while telling him that you hoped 'things were great at Binary!' leaving him no indication whatsoever that you were angry or uncomfortable with him," the letter reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caldbeck declined to comment. He has apologized to the women who came forward while disputing some of their allegations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In many cases there is always the need to stay friendly and responsive because you might need an introduction within their network or access to their resources in the future," said Meyer, who told The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> Caldbeck used his investment in her fitness start-up in 2015 as a pretext to grope and kiss her. "The quid pro quo is a horrible hand in skewed situations like this."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For an article on sexual harassment in the tech industry in The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span>, entrepreneur and investor Susan Wu recounted how, at a mostly male tech gathering in Las Vegas in 2009, Chris Sacca touched her face without her consent, making her feel uncomfortable. The cowboy-shirt-wearing technology investor best known for his appearances on Shark Tank told the newspaper he was "grateful to Susan and the other brave women sharing their stories." After the article appeared, Sacca changed his statement and said he disputed Wu's account of what happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to undermine her claim, Wu says Sacca shared with the reporter a friendly email she had written to him after the Las Vegas encounter as proof that she could not have felt "too badly about him or what had occurred." Sacca says The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> initiated the request for the email. The newspaper denies this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wu says she reached out to Sacca because he had become such a successful investor. "It would have been very challenging for me to work in tech and not attempt some sort of neutral-to-friendly demeanor with him, since his network of influence was so broad and far reaching," Wu says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That gatekeeping role in the business world where men hold a disproportionate share of the power is why so many women feel compelled to stay in touch with their harassers, venture capitalist and diversity advocate Freada Kapor Klein says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no plus for Susan or any woman to come forward about incidents of harassment years ago," Klein says. "You forever become the whistleblower, not the great engineer or VC or entrepreneur. Those who come forward do so to protect others and support the truth."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market has been branded a seller's paradise, with limited home inventories pushing up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, though, individual markets across the country vary widely. Strong economic and job growth, for example, drive buyer demand and home prices higher while a sluggish labor market tempers gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, tight housing supplies spur faster price increases and plentiful inventories keep a lid on values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western metro areas have both strong employment growth driven by the technology industry as well as onerous regulations that limit housing construction. The result: Sellers are in the driver's seat, and homes are selling quickly and above asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have more leverage in some northern and Mid-Atlantic metro areas that have higher unemployment rates or bigger housing stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are Owners.com's top 10 sellers' markets and top 10 buyers' markets in the 12 months through Oct. 31. It's based mostly on the average difference between homes' sale and listing prices, the average number of days listings linger on the market and the average number of houses in inventory.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices climbed in September while the scarcity of houses on the market hit a record low. The Standard &amp; Poor's CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index, released Tuesday, rose 6.2% in September from a year ago, the largest gain since June 2014. It's the 10th consecutive month the index has risen to an all-time high. In September, the fewest homes were available in that month since 2001.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After hitting the malls over the weekend, the resurgent American shopper takes the spotlight again in this week’s economic news, with reports on consumer confidence and spending due out. Data on new-home sales and manufacturing are also expected to reflect continued gains in those sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales soared 18. 9% in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000, the most in a decade. Rebuilding from hurricanes in Texas and Florida may be part of the story. But many Americans also may be buying newly-constructed homes because of a shortage of existing units. For October, economists surveyed by Action Economics expect the Commerce Department on Monday to report a drop of 8% from that lofty level to a still robust annual rate of 615,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: U. S. economy grew briskly at 3% in third quarter despite Hurricanes Harvey and Irma</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: More older Millennials are living with relatives, a legacy of 2007-09 recession</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence jumped to the highest level in 17 years in October on steady job and income growth and a stock market that keeps setting new records. &nbsp;Modestly higher gasoline prices may have damped Americans’ outlook marginally this month, says Gus Faucher, chief economist of PNC Financial Services Group. But the economists surveyed still expect the Conference Board on Tuesday to announce that its confidence index in November remained very close to its recent high. That would be “a good sign for a strong holiday sales season,” PNC wrote to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Commerce provides its second estimate of economic growth in the third quarter. Its first reading showed the nation’s gross domestic product expanding at a brisk 3% annual rate despite some negative effects from the hurricanes, as consumer and business spending more than offset weak housing construction. Consumption in the July-September period will likely be revised up on Wednesday, Faucher says, a bump that economists say should push third-quarter growth to an even stronger 3. 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending leaped&nbsp;1% in September, the most in eight years, largely as a result of the healthy labor market. Strong auto sales also helped underpin the surge as many people replaced vehicles damaged by the storms. Faucher says car sales declined in October, partly offsetting sturdy spending on services. Economists expect Commerce on Thursday to report a more modest 0. 2% gain last month in consumer spending, which makes up about 70% of economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation’s manufacturers have been buoyed by an improving global economy and a revived oil sector. Slower car sales likely crimped activity a bit in October, Faucher says. But economists still expect the <span class="companylink">Institute for Supply Management</span> on Friday to announce that its index of manufacturing activity continued to reveal strong growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Kirsten Anderson submitted a memo detailing her concerns about sexual harassment at the Iowa Capitol, she expected comments about women in the office -- their sex lives, breast sizes and the length of skirts worn by teenage pages -- to stop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Anderson was fired seven hours later from her job with the Iowa Republican Senate Caucus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After four years of litigation that ended in September, the state agreed to pay $1.75 million to settle her claim, leaving taxpayers footing the bill. Her case is among the first in a recent wave of high-profile sexual harassment cases that have roiled legislatures around the nation, highlighting the moral and financial liability states face as claims pile up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since last year, at least 40 lawmakers -- nearly all men -- in 20 states have been publicly accused by more than 100 people of some form of sexual misconduct or harassment, a <span class="companylink">USA TODAY NETWORK</span> analysis found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total, which doesn't include confidential or anonymous complaints or government staffers who have been accused of sexual misdeeds, reflects unprecedented levels of scrutiny on statehouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As allegations and swift actions are taken against high-profile men, including Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, and others accused of sexual harassment, there have been varying degrees of punishment for lawmakers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks ago, Kentucky House Speaker Jeff Hoover, a Republican, resigned from his leadership position amid growing pressure over a report that he settled a sexual harassment complaint made by a staff member.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, Florida's Senate president, Republican Joe Negron, ordered an investigation into allegations that Sen. Jack Latvala, a Republican running for governor, touched or made inappropriate comments about six women. Latvala denied the claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Republican Rep. Mark Lovell, a freshman Tennessee lawmaker, resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment. The resignation followed last year's expulsion of Jeremy Durham, a Republican representative who had inappropriate sexual contact with at least 22 women, according to an attorney general's investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ways lawmakers have handled sexual harassment and assault allegations have left some experts looking for change. "The consequence must fit the transgression," said Jennifer Drobac, an Indiana University law professor and expert on sexual harassment cases. "You have to withdraw the privileges, kick them out of Congress or out of the statehouse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Democrats and Republicans face accusations of misdeeds at nearly two dozen state capitols: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States that haven't seen allegations of sexual harassment by lawmakers have taken action. Several, including Wisconsin, North Dakota, Arkansas and Alaska, are working to change their sexual harassment policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laura Palumbo, communication director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, said the sudden national discussion has given victims and others a new sense of security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think that the level of attention that is currently on the issue of sexual harassment really does point us to a watershed moment where more victims are feeling comfortable coming forward with reports," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Mooney, director of the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois-Springfield, said he would "bet the farm" sexual harassment happens in most statehouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a structural situation that's the same in each state where you've got a lot of independent power controlled by men arbitrarily, and they've got stuff they can give, and some of them are willing to use it," Mooney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women make up less than a quarter of all state lawmakers, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In legislatures, where staffers, lawmakers and lobbyists intermingle inside and outside statehouses, reporting harassment is complicated by the fact that it is often unclear to whom victims should turn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, experts said, the traditional hurdles of speaking out about sexual harassment have begun to topple, in part because of fallout from scandals surrounding Weinstein and other prominent men accused of misconduct. Still, much needs to be done to address the issue, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we see lawmakers grabbing and groping people or paying people off in secret to keep quiet about abuse, that is not indicative of an evolved society," said <span class="companylink">Indiana University</span>'s Drobac. "We need to move beyond this Wild West 'I'm going to indulge all my passions' society and start living to a higher level."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A national uproar has erupted after revelations of years of sexual abuse by powerful Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. It has prompted more women to go public with their experiences of men exploiting positions of power, and some men in the business,&nbsp;technology and media worlds are being held accountable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hollywood: The list of Hollywood power players accused of sexual assault or harassment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Harvey Weinstein effect: Men are getting outed and some are getting fired as women speak up. And it's spreading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a list of powerful men outside of Hollywood who have either lost their jobs or faced other consequences after being accused&nbsp;of harassment or sexual misconduct since the Weinstein scandal broke:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Al&nbsp;Franken&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•&nbsp; Work: U. S. Senator for Minnesota, Democrat;&nbsp;former Saturday Night Live actor and writer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•&nbsp; Accusations: TV host and broadcaster Leeann Tweeden accused Franken of kissing and groping her without her consent while on a USO tour in the Middle East in 2006. Tweeden wrote in an online post: He "put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth. " She also tweeted an incriminating photograph. A second woman, Lindsay Menz, told CNN the senator&nbsp;pulled her in close and grabbed her buttocks while the two were posing for a picture at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•&nbsp; Consequence: The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate have both asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review the allegations. Franken apologized to Tweeden in a written statement and promised to cooperate with any investigation into the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•&nbsp; Franken said: “The first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone else who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worked for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women,” Franken wrote in a statement. &nbsp;“I respect women. &nbsp; I don't respect men who don't. &nbsp; And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roy Moore</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•&nbsp; Work: Candidate for U. S. Senate for Alabama, Republican</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•&nbsp; Accusations:&nbsp;Eight women accuse Moore of a range of inappropriate conduct, ranging from unwanted attention to sexual misconduct and assault. Most of the incidents took place when Moore was assistant district attorney in Gadsden from 1977 to 1982. One woman, Leigh Corfman, said she was 14 when Moore, then 32, took her to his home, undressed her and guided her hand over his crotch. The legal age of consent, then and now, is 16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•&nbsp; Consequence: Moore has not dropped out of the race, but he has lost the fundraising support of the&nbsp;National Republican Senatorial Committee and the <span class="companylink">Republican National Committee</span>. He is also down in the polls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•&nbsp; Moore said:&nbsp;Moore has called the allegations “completely false” and threatened to sue media outlets reporting them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenn Thrush</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•&nbsp; Work: White House reporter, The New York Times</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•&nbsp; Accusations: Several women accused Thrush of sexually inappropriate behavior, reports Vox. The report's author,&nbsp;Laura McGann, claimed Thrush came on to her at a bar and she had to extricate herself from him. McGann said she believes he later disparaged her to their newsroom colleagues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•&nbsp; Consequence: The New York Times said it will suspend&nbsp;Thrush while they investigate the allegations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•&nbsp; Thrush&nbsp;said: "Over the past several years, I have responded to a succession of personal and health crises by drinking heavily," said Thrush in a statement to Vox.

Let me be perfectly clear: no such allegations are true," he wrote. "I left DFJ because of interpersonal dynamics with my partners. "</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A holiday-shortened week of economic news will provide fresh readings on the housing market and business investment as well as <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> meeting minutes that could virtually assure an interest rate hike in mid-December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales have trended higher this year but remain choppy. Steady job and income gains have spurred growing demand. But housing supplies are meager as a result of both a construction worker shortage and a reluctance by many Baby Boomers to sell their homes and head to retirement havens. Home sales increased 0.8% in September, but that followed a 1.7% drop in August. For October, economists expect the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Tuesday to report a more modest 0.2% rise in existing home sales to a sturdy seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment has perked up this year in response to an improving global economy and an ongoing revival in oil production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital goods orders excluding aircraft and defense -- a proxy for capital spending -- has risen by a healthy 1.3% for three consecutive months. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Wednesday to announce another solid 0.5% jump in that measure for October as part of a report on business purchases of long-lasting goods such as aircraft and computers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the Fed didn't explicitly signal this month that it will raise interest rates for the third time this year at a mid-December meeting, it provided an upbeat appraisal of the economy that bolstered market expectations for another hike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed fund futures say there's a 91.5% chance the Fed will move again next month. Minutes of the Fed's Oct.31-Nov.1 meeting could all but guarantee it with more explicit language.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minutes also could help clarify Fed policymakers' view of inflation, which has been stubbornly low but showed signs of picking up recently, Nomura economist Lewis Alexander says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From producer Harvey Weinstein to actor Kevin Spacey, Hollywood’s reputation has been rocked by sexual harassment allegations. But the movie industry’s closet isn’t the only one with skeletons in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America’s labor movement, which has long touted its pro-worker bona fides, has a troubling harassment history of its own. This became apparent recently as female employees of the <span class="companylink">Service Employees International Union</span> (SEIU) came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct. Executive Vice President Scott Courtney, who had led the union’s aggressive Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign, recently resigned from his post after complaints surfaced about his relationships with female staffers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Harvey Weinstein 2020: This man is presidential material</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Trump needs to push Roy Moore out of Alabama Senate race</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a dozen current and former SEIU staffers&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;“complaints about top-level staff on the Fight for 15 campaign, including (Courtney), were an open secret, and that complaints about abusive and aggressive behavior by some organizers who reported to Courtney led to no action. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Courtney is hardly alone. The SEIU placed Mark Raleigh, another Fight for $15 official, on administrative leave for misconduct. The union also had to fire the leader of its Fight for $15 campaign in Illinois, Caleb Jennings, who allegedly shoved a female subordinate against a door frame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is cruelly ironic given that the Fight for $15 has&nbsp;repeatedly vowed&nbsp;to reduce “rampant sexual harassment in fast food restaurants. ” Perhaps the SEIU should practice some introspection before throwing stones from a glass house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the SEIU is not the only culprit. This year, Ford paid over $10 million to settle charges of sexual harassment at its <span class="companylink">United Auto Workers (UAW)-</span>represented Chicago plant. &nbsp;According to one report, “more than 1,500 female workers were subject to sexual abuse … by both Ford management and UAW officials from 2012 to 2014. ”&nbsp;The company responded by suspending the union’s plant chairman at the Chicago plant. Incredibly enough, the UAW filed a grievance against the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s right: The union stood up for one if its own officials over hundreds of female employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the current headlines, this problem is also personal for me. &nbsp;I work in a factory in Hamilton, Ala. that manufactures taper roller bearings. &nbsp;The UAW was a staple at the plant for decades, and had ceased to be an effective voice for employees. The union also intimidated those who chose to question the status quo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: 'The Advocate' knew about Spacey&nbsp;encounter with teen, but didn't speak up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">POLICING THE USA:&nbsp;A look at&nbsp;race, justice, media</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day, I saw union enforcers dropping tacks in the parking lot, targeting employees who dared to cross a picket line. Another day, the union president came to my car and said, “You know, your husband’s … not been in the best health. You know, what if he died?”&nbsp;Meanwhile, my best friend - another female employee at the factory - was on the receiving end of menacing sexual comments. As you can see, sexual harassment hits very close to home. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After enduring five votes and countless instances of harassment, my colleagues and I were able to decertify the UAW and get a taste of workplace freedom. Unfortunately, the harassment that changed my life forever is commonplace in the union America I left behind. And it’s especially debilitating to female workers, who are often forced to cope with aggressive, even violent, male leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As actors and actresses come out with their own sexual harassment allegations, please do not forget the rank-and-file. Our stories may not generate major headlines, but they are no less important. As Hollywood’s film union, SAG-AFTRA,&nbsp;has said, “We believe that each of us&nbsp;has&nbsp;a fundamental right to be safe in our person and&nbsp;to&nbsp;be treated with dignity and respect&nbsp;at work. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I agree. Now it’s time for organized labor to stop talking and start walking the walk.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had both positive and negative effects on the economy in September, boosting car sales but hurting housing starts, for example. Those impacts likely reversed in October, which should amount to a net gain for an economy that’s been humming along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices got a lift from the storms in September as refinery disruptions caused gasoline prices to spike. Pump prices, in turn, fell nearly 1. 5% last month, <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span> says, tempering inflation overall. Core prices, which strip out volatile food and energy items, rose just modestly in September, defying expectations that damaged homes and vehicles would push up rent and auto prices, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. But he says a bump in rent may show up with a lag in the October data. Alexander is also looking for a leap in prescription drug prices after a sharp drop in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, economists expect the Labor Department on Wednesday to report just a 0. 1% rise in consumer prices in October, pushing down the annual gain to 2% from 2. 2%. Core prices are expected to increase 0. 2%, leaving the 12-month increase unchanged at 1. 7%. The Federal Reserve has anticipated a pickup, especially in core inflation, to underpin its tentative plan to raise interest rates in December. Although that likely won’t be provided by Wednesday’s release, investors still expect the Fed to hike rates on the belief that low unemployment will soon juice wage growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Supply and demand: Here's why house hunting is so frustrating right now</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales were bolstered by the hurricanes in September as consumers in Texas and Florida bought new cars and flocked to building supply stores to begin repairs, while U. S. gas prices driven higher by the storms also pushed up sales totals. Those effects were probably offset in October, Alexander says. &nbsp;A core measure of sales - which excludes autos, gasoline, building materials and food services - was mixed in September. Sales online and at clothing stores rose smartly but traffic at furniture, electronics, sporting goods and health and personal care stores fell. Economists expect the Commerce Department to announce that overall retail sales edged up 0. 1% in October while the core measure increased a solid 0. 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the Fed reports industrial production for October. Output generally has been strong on an improving global economy and sturdy U. S. job and income growth. Texas refinery outages triggered by Hurricane Harvey in late August were still dampening production in September, but a recovery in October should have bolstered the numbers, Alexander says. Economists expect the Fed to report a healthy 0. 4% rise in industrial production last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts were pummeled by the hurricanes in September, falling 4. 7%. Economists expect Commerce on Friday to report an October rebound, with starts rising 5. 4%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new U.S. homes jumped last month to the highest level since October 2007, a sign that Americans -- unable to find existing homes -- are turning to new construction. Damage from last month's hurricanes may have also inflated the data. New home sales leapt 18.9% in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign of the ongoing shrinkage in traditional retailing, a department store that became a New York landmark has been sold to a company that plans to use it partly for shared office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flagship Lord &amp; Taylor store on Fifth Avenue in New York City was purchased by WeWork, a New York-headquartered work-space leasing company, for $850million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acquisition is part of a larger deal in which WeWork will lease space in other stores in chains owned by <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lord &amp; Taylor store will remain open through this and the 2018 holiday shopping season, then will be converted into a new headquarters for WeWork, additional office space and a redesigned 150,000-square-foot Lord &amp; Taylor store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change comes as traditional department stores are being challenged as never before by online retailers. They are responding by closing stores or, like in the case of Lord &amp; Taylor, reducing their footprint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lord &amp; Taylor says in a history on its website that it was the first big department store to move to Fifth Avenue and the first to have an elevator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The windows of our flagship location on Fifth Avenue have been making an impact on the New York fashion scene for more than 90 years," it says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WeWork also has agreements to lease retail space within several other <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay Co</span>. stores, including those in Toronto, Vancouver and in Frankfurt, Germany. The start-up, which has attracted funding from Softbank and others, has seen its valuation skyrocket to $20 billion, research firm CB Insights says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The toll that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma took on the U.S. economy will finally be revealed this week, though analysts are still forecasting solid third-quarter growth in a testament to the economy's resilience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports on business investment and new home sales will also be released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment has rebounded smartly this year on an improving global economy and a revival in U.S. oil drilling. In Commerce Department reports on orders and shipments of long-lasting goods such as computers and cars, capital goods orders excluding aircraft and defense -- a proxy for business capital spending -- rose a robust 1% or so in both July and August. Economists expect Commerce on Wednesday to announce more modest growth of 0.2% in that key measure in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales have risen this year, though they've been curtailed by shortages of construction workers and lots. Hurricane Irma likely further held back sales in Florida last month, Nomura economist Lewis Alexander says. On the positive side, rebuilding in the months ahead could boost new home sales somewhat, he says. Economists expect Commerce to report that new home sales fell 1.8% in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 550,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Hurricane Harvey slammed the Houston area in late August and Irma tore through Florida in early September, some economists predicted a hit that would lower third-quarter economic growth nearly a percentage point to about 2% -- in line with the tepid average during the 8-year-old recovery. But the nation's economy has been packing its own punch lately, with consumer spending rising on steady job and income growth, and business investment and stockpiling advancing solidly. Exports also have been strong as foreign buyers step up spending amid the strengthening global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Alexander says, the hurricanes likely dampened business investment in structures, while housing construction was constrained by the labor and land shortages. Overall, economists expect Commerce on Friday to report solid growth of 2.5% at an annual rate in the July to September period.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurricane Harvey, which battered the Houston area last month, is likely to continue to throw some cold water on August economic reports after already dousing retail sales and industrial output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week’s data includes releases on consumer confidence, consumer spending, new home sales and business investment. Any storm-tainted reports, and potentially offsetting increases in fourth-quarter activity, could make it tough to get an unclouded view of the economy in coming months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Median household income hits $59,039, rising for 2nd straight year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence has been booming in recent months as a result of solid job and income growth, hitting a 16-year high in March and retreating just modestly since then. But the recent flurry of hurricanes - including Harvey, Irma and Maria - may have dented Americans’ outlook the past few weeks, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. Economists expect the Conference Board on Tuesday to report a decline in its confidence index to a still healthy level in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales have been choppy lately, in part because of shortages of construction workers and available lots that have slowed building. Alexander says the hurricane might have curtailed activity in August as well. But after sales plunged 9. 4% in July, surveyed economists overall estimate the Commerce Department will announce a partial, 3. 2% rebound in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 590,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment has enjoyed a solid recovery this year as result of an improving global economy and a revival in oil drilling. Core capital goods orders - a measure that’s tantamount to business investment - rose a sturdy 0. 4% in July. Economists expect Commerce’s durable goods report Wednesday&nbsp;to show a more modest 0. 2% gain in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Commerce releases its third and final estimate of economic growth in the second quarter. In the last reading, growth was revised up sharply, from an annual rate of 2. 6% to 3%, because consumer spending was stronger than first believed. Consumption is likely to revise still higher in the upcoming estimate as a result of healthy spending on services, though that’s likely to be partly offset by softer retail sales, Alexander says. All told, economists expect Commerce to nudge up its estimate of growth in the April-June period to 3. 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumption in August, however, likely was hampered by Hurricane Harvey, particularly auto sales, according to <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span>. After consumer spending rose 0. 3% in July, economists expect Commerce on Friday to record a 0. 1% advance in August.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobless claims fall as storm's effects recede</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits dropped by 23,000 last week to 259,000 as the economic effect of Hurricane Harvey began to fade. The Labor Department said the less-volatile four-week average rose by 6,000 to 268,750. In early September, jobless claims shot up by the most in five years as Harvey battered Texas.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central bank may announce it will start shrinking its portfolio</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A historic <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> meeting highlights this week's economic news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Fed isn't expected to raise interest rates, Fed officials have indicated they'll announce that they'll begin to shrink the bloated asset portfolio the central bank has built since the Great Recession. That move will slowly push up long-term interest rates. Reports on housing starts and existing home sales will also be released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts have been choppy in recent months, falling 4.8% in July. With existing home supplies at historically low levels, demand for new houses is strong. But a shortage of construction workers and a limited supply of lots has constrained building. Multifamily starts, meanwhile, have pulled back after the market was flooded with new apartments in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Nomura economist Lewis Alexander expects a rebound in multifamily construction for August, more than offsetting a decline in single-family starts. He expects minimal effects from Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area, though he says that impact could loom larger in coming months. Overall, economists expect the Commerce Department on Tuesday to report a 2.2% rise in August housing starts to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> announces the number of existing home sales in the U.S. last month.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A historic Federal Reserve meeting highlights this week’s economic news. While the Fed isn’t expected to raise interest rates, Fed officials have indicated they’ll announce that they’ll begin to shrink the bloated asset portfolio the central bank has built since the Great Recession. &nbsp;That move will slowly push up long-term interest rates. Reports on housing starts and existing home sales will also be released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median household income hits $59,039, rising for 2nd straight year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vice Chair Stanley Fischer stepping down from Fed, citing 'personal reasons'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economy added tepid 156,000 jobs in August</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts have been choppy in recent months, falling 4. 8% in July. With existing home supplies at historically low levels, demand for new houses is strong. But a shortage of construction workers and a limited supply of lots has constrained building. Multifamily starts, meanwhile, have pulled back after the market was flooded with new apartments in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Nomura economist Lewis Alexander expects a rebound in multifamily construction for August, more than offsetting a decline in single-family starts. He expects minimal effects from Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area , though he says that impact could loom larger in coming months. Overall, economists expect the Commerce Department on Tuesday to report a 2. 2% rise in August housing starts to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1. 2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the National Association of Realtors announces the number of existing home sales in the U. S. last month. Sales have been subdued lately, mostly because of the low housing supplies, which also have driven prices higher. But demand remains healthy as a result of solid job and income growth. And so economists figure sales rebounded modestly in August after two straight monthly declines, rising 0. 6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5. 5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has been preparing markets for months for the gradual shrinking of its $4. 5 trillion balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During and after the recession and 2008 financial crisis, the Fed bought more than $3 trillion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to lower long-term rates for home buyers and other borrowers. Now that the economy is on more solid footing, the Fed wants to begin whittling down the portfolio. That’s expected to nudge up rates slowly, but with investors anticipating the move, little short-term impact is expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed watchers likely will be paying more attention to whether Fed policymakers continue to forecast a third interest rate hike in 2017. With inflation still weak, the Fed’s median forecast could push that rate increase into 2018.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GREENVILLE, Del. &nbsp;- The first stone used to build Crooked Billet, a tavern that became a longtime du Pont mansion, was laid nearly a century before the Revolutionary War on land given&nbsp;by William Penn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operated as a tavern from 1702 to 1811, the mansion is said to have hosted Gen. George Washington and his men on their way to fight in the Sept. 11, 1777, Battle of Brandywine, a Delaware battle that the Americans lost to the British in the Revolutionary War.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, this registered National Historic Place is for sale for the first time since 1864 when Henry, Lammot and Éleuthère du Pont, partners in nearby gunpowder mills, bought the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2017 price tag: $2. 85 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">► Sept. 7: Long-term U. S. mortgage rates fall to lowest level this year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">► Sept. 6: Historic railroad depot turned hilltop home for sale for $1. 05M</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That includes the nine-bedroom, 8,875-square-foot home; a spacious guest house featuring a stone fireplace, tavern-style bar and screened porch overlooking the pool; a detached four-car, carriage-style garage topped with a two-bedroom apartment; and 4. 2 acres of mature, three-season gardens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original tavern section remains. While wings have been added and the estate renovated, the building retains much of its earlier appearance, according to its National Register certification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s about as classic as classic gets,” said managing partner Laird Bunch of&nbsp;Brandywine Fine Homes, <span class="companylink">Sotheby’s International Realty</span>, who is marketing the property. “It’s a really special part of the area’s history. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Centuries-old 12-inch heart pine flooring spans most of the main level, which also features intricate built-in cabinets and bookshelves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the oldest room of the home, doors with big brass knobs and locks swing open on hand-forged iron strap hinges, sweeping over a herring-bone patterned brick floor. The original exposed wood beam ceiling overlooks an oversized fireplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous owner Marion du Pont McConnell grew up at Crooked Billet. Her mother, Jean Ellen du Pont McConnell Shehan, who died in 2011, was an accomplished equestrian known for the prize horses she kept on the estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1976, the land was added to the National Register of Historic Places, part of its significance was being the “last surviving farm property in a sprawling suburban district” and “a rare surviving example of early rock construction. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, McConnell and her husband, John Kai Lassen, sold the estate - including the house and the 28. 34-acre property on which it sits - for about $6. 5 million, according to public records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">► Sept. 3: Is your home really a safe investment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">► Sept. 1: 42 states with the highest home seller profits</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Crooked Billet LLC, whose managing partner is Dewson Construction, owns it. The developer is preserving the main house and about 15 acres of surrounding open space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remaining land will be developed in conjunction with Bernardon Architecture into a 55-plus community of 19 homes with construction expected to begin in coming weeks. An additional seven houses will be built that are not age restricted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This property is such an historic part of the area, just dead-center in the heart of Greenville and the last remaining land,” Bunch said. “We are going to preserve that history. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Day 1, the family has been involved in the development's&nbsp;planning, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, when John Kai Lassen was president of the Society of Mayflower Descendants in the State of Delaware, he shared some of the history of his home in the group’s fall newsletter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penn deeded the property to Adam Stedham, who in 1684 built a two-room, stone home, Lassen wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stedham’s son, William, expanded the structure in 1702 into the Crooked Billet,&nbsp;following the tradition of English taverns to hang a bent stick, or billet, over the door to signal travelers. The word “billet” also can refer to lodging, particularly of soldiers in a private home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Crooked Billet continued to operate as an inn until 1811&nbsp;when the Kennett Road was moved to the northeast to become a toll road known as the Kennett Pike, leaving Crooked Billet about 2,000 feet back from the new road,” Lassen wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because it lost its street frontage, Crooked Billet became a farm and passed to the du Pont family in 1864.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON - Long-term US mortgage rates fell this week, led by the benchmark 30-year rate, which declined for the sixth straight week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage buyer <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> says the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell to 3. 78 percent, from 3. 82 percent in the previous week. That is down sharply from this year’s peak of 4. 3 percent, reached in March, though it remains slightly above last year’s average of 3. 65 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-term mortgage rates typically follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which has fallen to 2. 05 percent, the lowest level this year. Bond yields have fallen as investors, rattled by everything from North Korean nuclear tests to hurricanes in the U. S. , have flocked to the safety of Treasurys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 15-year mortgage averaged 3. 08 percent, down from 3. 12 percent last week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation is driving the national economic conversation. And economists will comb through this week's upcoming data particularly for trending signs on price directions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the kerfuffle in President Trump's souring relationship with Corporate America, the consensus still points to the U.S. economic recovery continuing at its steady pace. The stock market buoyancy reflects the nation's general optimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But persistently weak inflation -- a reflection that wage and price increases are not taking hold -- was noted as a cause for concern in the minutes of <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> policymakers' July 25-26 meeting that was released Wednesday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales for July, which will be released by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Thursday, will also likely convey robust demand in housing.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is the Federal Reserve still shrugging off weak inflation and looking to raise interest rates for a third time this year? Minutes of the Fed’s late July meeting could give some clues. This week’s economic releases will also reveal whether retail sales bounced back last month and provide the latest data on housing starts and industrial production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales have been surprisingly choppy in recent months despite solid job and income growth, and still-cheap gasoline. June brought a dip in both overall sales and a core measure that excludes volatile items such as autos and gasoline. Nomura economist Lewis Alexander figures purchases rebounded last month. And <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span> says Amazon Prime Day likely gave the measure a further shot in the arm. Economists surveyed expect the Commerce Department to report Tuesday that the broad and core readings of sales each jumped 0. 4% in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minutes of the Fed’s July 25-26 meeting will be released Wednesday. Most Fed officials have downplayed this year’s drop in annual inflation further below the central bank’s 2% target, attributing it to temporary declines in prices for items such as cell phone service and prescription drugs. But Alexander notes the softness recently has extended to other categories, such as apparel. If the minutes indicate that more Fed policymakers see the weak inflation as longer-lasting, it could reduce the chances of an anticipated hike in the Fed’s key short-term rate late this year. The meeting account will also likely affirm that the Fed plans to begin shrinking its $4. 5 trillion asset portfolio in September, an initiative that’s expected to gradually push up long-term rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts generally have been climbing but shortages of construction workers and available lots, along with more stringent zoning constraints, have made for a volatile performance from month to month. Starts surged 8. 3% in June. And so economists expect Commerce to announce a more modest 0. 8% gain to a seasonally adjusted 1. 2 million starts in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production has picked up in recent months as a result of the improving global economy and rebound in oil drilling. Despite more sluggish auto production now that sales have moderated, economists expect the Fed to report Thursday that industrial production rose solid 0. 3% last month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baby Boomers are deciding to stay put, reducing options for first-time buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can't find a house to buy? Blame Baby Boomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of residential houses for sale is at a 20-year low as the appeal of McMansions wanes and Baby Boomers grow increasingly reluctant to trade up or down from their homes, according to a survey by Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of its survey respondents, or 59%, said they didn't plan to sell their houses in the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, there was a 4.3-month supply of homes -- the time it would take to run out of homes for sale if no new units were added -- on the market in June. That's down from 4.6 months a year ago and a normal inventory of six months, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crunch has driven home prices up. The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller national home price index was up 5.6% in May from a year earlier, hitting an all-time high. Some markets are frothier, with average home prices up 13.3% in Seattle and 7.9% in Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing shortage forced many first-time homebuyers to consider smaller homes and condos as a way to literally get their foot in the door," says Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. "Our survey data reveals that we may see more of these homes hitting the market in the next year, but whether these owners actually list will depend on whether they can find another home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtor.com, a real estate listing site operated by <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>., surveyed 1,054 randomly selected homeowners across the U.S. July 6 to July 13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A vast majority of those who are at or near retirement age like where they are, the survey found. Eighty-five percent of Boomers said they have no plans to sell their home in the next year. Homeownership among Boomers is at 78%, or about 33 million properties. That's nearly twice as high as Millennials. Older age groups have historically moved less frequently than younger home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market dynamics have shifted because more people are in the older age groups than in past years. People ages 55-74 made up 21% of the population in 2015, compared with 16% in 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Clark, 72, a retired teacher, considered moving from his three-bedroom house in Greeley, Colo., to retirement mecca Phoenix. But, he says, "I've developed friends here. I'm with the (Veterans Administration). Why would I want to move?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Boomers hold the key to those homes the market desperately needs, both in the urban condo and the detached suburban home segment," Realtor.com's Hale says. "But with a strong economy and rising home prices, there's really no reason for established homeowners to sell in the short term. Although downsizing might be on the minds of Boomers, they face the same inventory shortages and price increases plaguing Millennials."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, there are fewer new homes for Boomers and others to buy. The number of housing starts remains about 35% below normal levels despite a gradual climb since the mid-2000s real estate crash. And nearly 10% of homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their houses are worth, down from 29% in 2012, according to ATTOM Data Solutions, but still higher than the historical average of about 5%. That prevents many of those "underwater" homeowners from selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the gap between trade-up homes and premium homes has widened, pricing out many Boomers who would like to move up, says Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist of real estate research firm Trulia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combine those headwinds with the fact that many Boomers are content with their houses. When those who are reluctant to sell were asked why they plan to remain, 72% said their home meets their family's needs. Thirteen percent cited financial security concerns and 12% the need to make home improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boomers also appear less eager to move to a traditional retirement locale, such as Florida or Arizona, and more interested in maintaining close ties with family and friends, Hale says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the 35% of homeowners who said they're planning to sell in the next year, more than half of them were Millennials looking for larger homes or better features. The supply of starter homes in the market is down 17% from a year ago, and medium-sized houses are down 10%.</p>

Google manifesto fuels sexism debate</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Men, women on both sides are taking a stand</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hot-button issue of gender bias in the workplace has just gone thermonuclear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the weekend, an incendiary manifesto from Google software engineer James Damore -- citing biology as one reason why women weren't well-represented in technology jobs or leadership positions -- inflamed an already-contentious debate on the topic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then on Monday, Damore was fired. A frenzied social media firestorm ensued, with conservative commentators, women's rights activists, rank-and-file workers and others bombarding social media with impassioned posts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some hailed Damore as a hero for his courage to pen a memo that touted the benefits of ideological diversity over gender diversity. Others said he was a bigot who fostered a hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manifesto maelstrom puts a glaring spotlight on the challenges companies face in the drive for greater gender diversity and inclusion. There are myriad views on what it will take to achieve workplace equality, as well as lingering doubt parity will ever come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's deep sociological change that needs to happen that can only happen over time," says Jessica Rovello, CEO of Arkadium, a developer of AI tools for publishers, who adds that she has had frequent encounters with both overt and unconscious bias in her career. "It will take years, if not decades, to have gender parity in the workplace. But with small steps, we move forward."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue became so serious Google CEO Sundar Pichai ended his vacation to discuss the matter with staffers, eventually making the decision to fire Damore. Pichai was expected to address the issue with employees on Thursday, but <span class="companylink">Google</span> abruptly canceled that meeting amid concerns over employee safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Google</span> imbroglio is just one in a string of high-profile gender bias and harassment incidents at major companies and comes as some firms ramp up their inclusion initiatives and work to eradicate an exclusionary, male-centric atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of companies that have dedicated staff and funding to diversity programs, grew from 13% in 2011 to 17% in 2014, according to the latest survey data from the <span class="companylink">Society of Human Resource Management</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At companies such as <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, executives tasked with improving diversity and inclusion programs aim to create environments where women and minorities get a better chance of both landing jobs and thriving in their new positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women still hold fewer leadership positions than men, are paid less, aren't fully represented in expanding industries such as tech and still face high rates of harassment. Consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 70% of <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s overall staffers are men, as is 75% of its leadership, according to company statistics from January 2017. Of the nation's overall computing workforce, women make up just a quarter of workers, according to the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016, the median weekly full-time earnings for all female workers was $749 and equivalent for all male workers was $915, according to the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> and the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among Fortune 500 companies, 32 CEOs are women, according to Fortune magazine's June tally, a record number that still represents only 6% of those corporate leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost 60% of women have reported some form of gender harassment, which includes sexist, crude or offensive behavior at work, according to a June 2016 <span class="companylink">U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span> report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down in June after facing claims that he fostered a toxic and sexist work culture. Binary Capital partner Justin Caldbeck resigned from his VC firm after being accused of harassing women who were trying to raise money from him. Last year, Fox News CEO Roger Ailes was ousted in a sexual harassment scandal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there are questions about the effectiveness of such programs, and in some instances, concern some initiatives -- and penalties -- have gone too far. Both women and men recently stood by some of their embattled peers, such as Caldbeck, painting their punishments as too swift and harsh and saying that some men have served as scapegoats for years of bottled up frustration over unchecked sexism in tech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a "witch hunt mentality," says Heidi Dangelmaier, who runs an all-female innovation firm, GirlApproved, in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his memo, Damore laid out the differences between men and women, saying that on average, woman have higher anxiety and lower stress tolerance and that men have a higher drive for status. While those thoughts outraged many people, others have urged that Damore's points be assessed with balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At most, Damore argues that because of innate cognitive and personality differences, a 50/50 gender balance in the tech sector may be unrealistic," <span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span> Opinion contributor Cathy Young wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman suggested Silicon Valley companies sign a "decency pledge" to hold managers accountable. VC firm The Foundry Group has a "Zero Tolerance Policy" on harassment, which it publicly posted in late June. Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, now running fitness start-up Chorus, suggested in July to Fortune that men start funneling more money to female entrepreneurs and VCs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Change has to come from the top down, longtime venture capitalist Aileen Lee of Cowboy Ventures says. "The impression you get is it's these guys in their 20s partying and misbehaving, but the bigger challenge is to get leaders of all ages to face the big gender and inclusion issues in our industry," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a good time for company chiefs to embrace introspection, says Joelle Emerson, CEO of diversity and inclusion strategy firm Paradigm. "It's easy to call out other companies and not really reflect on your own culture," Emerson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaders also get outraged with egregious examples of sexual harassment but often don't pay attention to less apparent -- but also important -- areas, such as bias in hiring, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's all connected," she says. "If you're not hiring that many women, then there aren't many in key meetings, and that can allow harassment to flourish."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Men and women on both sides of the divide are making stands and airing grievances. This alone is a positive sign that perhaps change is coming, Jahan Sagafi of Outten &amp; Golden says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Women are more confident now about coming forward and putting it out there," he says. "With each additional woman who points out discrimination, there's a chance to spur real change."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week’s economic releases will reveal whether growth accelerated in the second quarter after a sluggish start to the year. A busy week also features a Federal Reserve meeting that’s not expected to include an interest rate hike and the latest reports on home sales and business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales have increased solidly this year but have been restrained by skimpy supplies. In May, sales edged up 1. 1% despite an 8. 4% drop in inventories from a year ago, notes Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. He says job growth has been healthy, fueling demand. Yet sales are likely to remain choppy until the stock of homes on the market expands. Economists estimate the National Association of Realtors will report Monday that home sales dipped 1. 2% in June to a still-sturdy seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5. 6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence hit a 16-year high in March, but has edged down since. Job growth remains healthy and gasoline is cheap, but economists cite&nbsp;doubts among Republicans about President Trump’s proposed tax cuts that have grown with the setback in efforts to replace the Affordable Care Act. The Conference Board is expected to report Tuesday that its consumer confidence index slipped further in July to a still-sunny reading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After raising interest rates last month for the second time this year, the Fed is likely to pause at a meeting ending Wednesday&nbsp;as it awaits a pickup in inflation. Yet many economists believe the central bank will provide another signal that it’s set to begin reducing its $4. 5 trillion asset portfolio in September. Fed Chair Janet Yellen told Congress last week that initiative, which will gradually push up long-term rates, should start “relatively soon. ” The Fed expanded the balance sheet after the financial crisis to lower&nbsp;rates for mortgage and other borrowers. &nbsp;Now, some Fed officials worry&nbsp;low rates could drive investments from bonds to riskier assets, creating bubbles that might burst and trigger another downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RELATED:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment picked up early this&nbsp;year but was tepid for much of the second quarter. Economists figure the Commerce Department will announce Thursday that orders for capital goods excluding aircraft and defense - a reading tantamount to&nbsp;capital spending - rose a respectable 0. 4%&nbsp;in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Commerce releases its report on economic growth in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 1. 4% annual rate in the first quarter - below the recovery’s 2% average - as sluggish consumer spending offset strong business investment. In the April-June period, consumer spending accelerated, due to a pickup in service&nbsp;outlays, Alexander says. Meanwhile, business investment&nbsp;increased modestly while weak housing starts and the widening U. S. trade deficit subtracted from growth, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> says. Economists estimate Commerce will announce the economy grew at a solid 2. 5% pace last quarter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KNOXVILLE, Tenn. - Could working as a waitress at restaurants like Hooters or Twin Peaks be bad for your mental health?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two researchers in the Psychology Department at the <span class="companylink">University of Tennessee</span> here published research that they say shows a link.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Psychology Professor Dawn Szymanski and graduate student Renee Mikorski studied more than 250 female restaurant servers for their work,&nbsp;Sexually Objectifying Environments: Power, Rumination, and Waitresses’ Anxiety and Disordered Eating, published at the end of May in the journal Psychology of Women Quarterly. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two used an online survey promoted via social media to find female restaurant servers in the United States 18 or older who spoke English. &nbsp;After eliminating those who weren’t servers now or who didn’t fully complete the survey, they ended up with 252 participants ages 18 to 66. ►</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly half were enrolled in a college or university. And nearly half, 48%, were from the South; 20% each were from the Midwest and North and&nbsp;12% were from the West.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">► 2015: 'Guy candy' eatery, all-male Hooters, opening in Dallas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were predominantly -&nbsp;87% -&nbsp;white, and more than a third identified as working class while most of the rest identifying as middle class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey asked the women questions such as whether they were encouraged to wear sexually revealing clothing&nbsp;or whether male customers stared at them. But it also asked about the power structure -&nbsp;whether more men than women were in supervisory positions&nbsp;and whether male employees seemed to have more power than female employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers concluded that women who work in “sexually objectifying restaurant environments,” where they wear revealing clothing and are encouraged to flirt with customers, were at greater risk for anxiety and eating disorders. That was&nbsp;not only because their bodies were displayed and scrutinized, in some instances with their appearance “graded” by customers and supervisors, but also because they lacked power at work to control their own environment, such as with sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most people are pretty respectful," Ashley Yonan, who worked during college for two years at a Hooters in Santa Monica, Calif. , told Cosmopolitan in 2015. &nbsp;"It's a sexually charged atmosphere so there may be a few innuendos, but being a Hooters girl&nbsp;you kind of can't be offended by that because you signed up for this and you are embracing that sexual atmosphere. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another who rose to the role of corporate trainer told the magazine that she thought management was good at handling the few drunken men who were inappropriate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Power dynamics in such restaurants was a theme in a 2011 study by Szymanski and Erika Carr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Szymanski and Mikorski&nbsp;built on previous research that suggests women may develop negative emotions such as sadness, anxiety, guilt, insecurity, disgust and confusion or psychological problems like depression or anorexia as coping mechanisms because of their repeated exposure to objectification.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They focused their research on restaurants like Hooters&nbsp;rather than on sexual harassment and objectification and lack power among female servers in restaurants in general&nbsp;because those types of restaurants are growing in popularity even as some - Hooters and the Tempe, Ariz. -based Tilted Kilt Pub &amp; Eatery with more than 50 locations in 26 states and Canada&nbsp;&nbsp;- have had discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuits filed against them on behalf of female employees,&nbsp;Szymanski said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We want to raise awareness about the negative impact that these types of restaurant environments may have on female servers,” Syzmanski said. “We want the public to use this data in personal decisions about whether to support or not support these types of restaurants. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Hooters -&nbsp;two private companies, Atlanta-based&nbsp;<span class="companylink">Hooters of America LLC</span> and Clearwater, Fla. -based&nbsp;Hooters Inc. ,&nbsp;that&nbsp;operate&nbsp;more than 450 eateries in 43 states and 28 countries - nor Dallas-based Twin Peaks, which has more than 80 locations in 25 states, commented on the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study also noted that women who already have psychological issues may choose to work in such environments&nbsp;or may be more likely to perceive their environment as sexually objectifying. The survey did not ask women about their mental health histories and was limited to those with computer access, the researchers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our study offers some groundwork” for later, more detailed studies into a link between those types of restaurants and mental health, the researchers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also hoped the study might alert professionals who could help women in those jobs develop skills, such as boundary setting, to help them maintain good psychological health.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unusually light week of economic news will reveal whether the recent slump in housing starts ended last month, providing a needed boost to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The kickoff of the second-quarter earnings season will likely draw more attention, with CNBC reporting that <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Capital IQ</span> expects record profits for S&amp;P 500 companies, up 6.2% from a year ago. That could provide additional fuel for the frothy stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among companies reporting are <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> (earnings-per- share estimate of 43 cents, up from 41 cents a year ago); <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> (16 cents, up from 9 cents); and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> (71 cents, up from 69 cents).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In economic news, the Labor Department announces the latest reading of its import price index on Tuesday. Import prices usually don't get much notice. But stubbornly low inflation is getting more scrutiny from <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials who could be persuaded to forgo a third interest rate hike this year if the meager price increases continue. A weakening dollar has pushed up prices of imported goods, partly reversing previous declines due to a strong greenback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But import prices fell 0.3% in May, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. Even core import prices, which strip out volatile food and energy items, were unchanged. Another sluggish reading could signal more weakness ahead for overall inflation in the U.S. Economists expect Labor to report that import prices fell another 0.2% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' (<span class="companylink">NAHB</span>) sentiment index has ticked down in recent months but remains elevated. It could be an indicator of housing starts and new home sales in the months ahead. Steady job and income gains have bolstered demand for new single-family homes, Alexander says. Economists expect <span class="companylink">NAHB</span> to announce that the measure edged up in July to a healthy 68 from 67 the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts, however, have dropped for three straight months. The main culprit has been the volatile multifamily market but single- family construction has slipped as well. Alexander figures single- family starts are poised for a comeback but multifamily could continue to slow. All told, economists estimate the Commerce Department will report Wednesday that housing starts rose 6.2% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.2 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melissa Cefalu, a veterinarian, and her husband Andrew, a chiropractor, have their dream jobs. But they're living a nightmare of self-denial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buried under $365,000 of student loan debt, they never take vacations, instead snatching occasional long weekends with friends or relatives. Andrew drives a 13-year-old Chevy Tahoe. And rather than buy new clothes, Melissa, 35, makes do with her sister's hand-me-downs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every penny is accounted for" even though the couple's combined salary is $125,000 and they live in the affordable town of Madison, Miss. , Melissa says. "I love what I do but ... I don't feel my degree was worth the sacrifices we have to make every single day. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many analysts say the nation's record high $1. 34 trillion in student debt is also casting a long shadow over the economy, delaying home purchases, crimping consumer spending and inhibiting business formation. As President Trump sets out to juice an economy that has grown a lackluster 2% a year since the recession ended in 2009, these economists count student debt -- along with an aging population and weak productivity -- as another obstacle in his path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"EVERY PENNY IS ACCOUNTED FOR"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It delays the economic life cycle for the younger generation," says Marshall Steinbaum, senior economist at the Roosevelt Institute. "People would have started their economic lives at zero and now they're starting at a negative balance. " That, he says, widens the wealth gap and could have "negative consequences (on spending) that reduces (economic) growth. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with high school graduates poised to enter college later this summer, other economists say the oft-lamented "student debt crisis" is over-hyped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're paying a higher amount but your earnings are also higher," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one disputes that heavy student debt loads have become more prevalent as tuition has skyrocketed and budget-strapped states have doled out less money to public universities. Since 2007, total student debt has nearly tripled while the number of people with loans has climbed to 44 million from 28 million. The Great Recession prompted many young adults to stay in school longer, while many older laid-off workers returned to college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, nearly 70% of college seniors graduated with student debt, up from less than half in 1993, and their average tab had tripled to $30,100, according to the Institute for College Access and Success. All told, about 20% of American adults and 35% of Millennials are burdened by student debt, according to a 2015 Gallup poll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wages have not kept up. From 2007 to 2015, average student loan balances surged 60% while average pay for recent graduates rose 13%, FitchRatings says. About 8 million borrowers are in default on their loans, damaging their ability to rent apartments, buy cars and even get jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest toll is in the housing market, some experts say. The homeownership rate for Americans under 35 fell to 34% last year from 41% in 2000. The trend has hurt housing construction -- and prevents Millennials' from building wealth that spurs more spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on a 3. 5% mortgage rate, a home buyer shelling out $203 in student loan payments each month can afford $45,000 less in mortgage than a buyer without student debt, <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> says. Student debt makes it harder to save for a down payment and make monthly mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It all adds up to a pretty grim picture for first-time home buyers," says Bill Warlick, a senior analyst for Fitch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers, who typically drive growth in the housing market, make up 32% of all existing home sales, down from a prerecession level of 40%. Student debt "will be a big shadow that prevents a return back to normal" for at least several years, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Graceanne Hillyer of Olathe, Kan. , has$70,000 in college loans and her husband, Nathan, has $30,000. For several years, the couple, who work for the same insurance company, have tried to set aside $200 to $500 a month for a down payment. But despite total household income topping $100,000, the task is more formidable because of their combined $1,100 in monthly student loan bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of people our age already have houses," Graceanne says. She says the couple has only basic cable and she grudgingly rejects her husband's pleas to buy new electronics such as a larger flat screen TV. "I said maybe we can get that when we get ahead of the game," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all isn't lost. The Hillyers expect to have enough saved for a down payment in two years. A Federal Reserve study found that student debt delays home purchases for adults in their 20s, but by age 30 to 34, the homeownership rates of college grads with and without student debt are nearly identical at about 42% and well above the 30% for those with no college. In other words, the benefit of a college degree on homeownership seem to be deferred, but not squashed, by student debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the financial strain also affects consumer spending, which makes up about 70% of economic activity. The share of household outlays accounted for by Americans under 35 fell steadily from about 16% in 2007 to 12. 8% in the fourth quarter, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> and government figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It has impacted the affordability of the American dream -- from car purchases to home purchases to starting a business to saving for retirement to paying for medical care and cell phone service," says Natalia Abrams, head of Student Debt Crisis, which advocates for borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What do student borrowers themselves say? Seventy-one percent of non-homeowners surveyed by the National Association of Realtors last year cited student loan debt as the chief factor delaying their home purchases. And among all borrowers, 57% said the debt affected their ability to buy a car, clothing (41%), and entertainment (43%), and to start a small business (33%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ARE STUDENT LOANS HURTING NEW BUSINESS FORMATION?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of new entrepreneurs age 20 to 34 dropped to 24. 4% last year from 34. 8% in 1996, according to the <span class="companylink">Kauffman Foundation</span>, which studies entrepreneurship. A nationwide study by the <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Fed</span> concluded significantly higher student debt in a given county compared to the U. S. average resulted in 14. 4% fewer new businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers find it harder to invest their own funds to start a business, pay expenses before the firm is profitable and get loans, says Arnobio Morelix, Kauffman's senior research analyst. Business start-ups are vital to growth because they tend to hire more workers and devise innovations that increase productivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics argue that the higher earnings that result from college degrees typically more than offset the added debt. Mark Kantrowitz, a consultant on student loans and scholarships, says that from 1995 to 2013, the average debt-payment-to-income share for college graduates ranged from 9. 1% to 11%, according to his analysis of federal data. He says perceptions of a student debt "crisis" are colored by the fewer than 1% of borrowers with debts over $100,000, 90% of whom are professionals such as doctors and lawyers who can easily afford the loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Chingos, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, attributes the hand-wringing over student loans to the growing share of borrowers from wealthier families. He says it's not clear that providing that group relief would help the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those squeezed, Kantrowitz says, are college dropouts who are stuck with the debt payments but never realized the fruits of a degree, or graduates who chose less practical majors such as ethics and history. Dropouts are four times as likely to default on their loans, he says, citing his analysis of Education Department figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't have a student loan problem so much as a college completion problem," Kantrowitz says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PERCEPTION OR REALITY?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Colin King, 24, of Buffalo, the remedy for his student debt woes is to take out yet another loan for more schooling. He pays $150 a month toward $50,000 in loans for Bachelors and Masters degrees in biology. He hoped to be a research assistant, which in his city would pay as much as $55,000. But King earns $34,000 as a lab technician. He has two other jobs, as an Uber driver and adjunct professor, but still can't afford to eat out more than once a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he's seeking another $70,000 in student loans to become a physician's assistant but says the $100,000 starting salary will more than offset the expense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mathematical models and budget crunching may overlook consumer perceptions, says Rohit Chopra, a senior fellow at the <span class="companylink">Consumer Federation of America</span>. He cites the Realtors group study that showed Millennials bemoaning the effects of student debt on their housing and other purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sometimes the perception about your financial future is even more influential than reality, Chopra says. "They may qualify to buy a house" but never even try "if they perceive their debt is too big," Chopra says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By many measures, the effort to convert old elevated railway on Chicago's Northwest Side into a signature park has been a smashing success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2.7-mile recreation trail, known as The 606, built on an old Chicago &amp; Pacific Railroad line has been praised as a model use of public space since it opened two years ago. It's regularly packed with bikers, joggers and walkers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Art installations and eclectic programming -- including evening stargazing sessions, Afro-Latin music and dance demonstrations and puppet shows -- have helped make the linear park a destination that draws visitors from beyond the four neighborhoods the trail bisects. Volunteers of the park have even picked fruit grown from the Serviceberry shrubs along the trail and turned them over to a popular Italian ice shop to make treats for a fundraiser for the trail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 606's charms notwithstanding, some residents along the western portion of the trail say the recreational space has been both a blessing and curse. It brought much-needed green space in a part of Chicago that lacked it, but it is also driving up property values and rent prices in their once affordable neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I miss my neighborhood, I miss my neighbors, I miss my local stores," said Alicia Avila, who had rented near the western edge of the trail for 11 years but moved to a cheaper Chicago suburb this month as a result of the rising housing costs that have followed the trail, which takes its name from the Chicago zip code prefix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I know gentrification is going to happen, but it should happen in a responsible way so that people who have been here for many years can co-inhabit the same space."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call it the greening neighborhood conundrum. The paradox Chicago faces with its new-ish gem to its park system is one playing out in other big cities around the U.S. that are also finding it's difficult to add marquee park space on derelict tracks and bridges in low-income areas while also keeping housing prices in check for longtime residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, designers and city officials seeking to create recreational space on abandoned industrial eyesores are increasingly recognizing - - though some belatedly -- that they have a chicken-and-egg quandary on their hands: How do you add green space in lower-income areas without inevitably setting those populations up to be displaced by more well-heeled neighbors looking to enjoy the amenities?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This issue calls for cross-sector collaboration," said Adrian Benepe, director of city park development at <span class="companylink">The Trust for Public Land</span>, the San Francisco-based non-profit group that worked with Chicago officials on developing The 606. "It's not enough to say you're going to build a park and stick your head in the sand and say: 'We only care about the park. We don't care what else might be going on.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta's Mayor Kasim Reed announced plans for a fund in April to help residents living near parts of Atlanta's Beltline pay their rising tax bills in the area that has seen a rejuvenation during a years-long plan to rebuild an old railway into a multi-use trail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bozeman, Mont., the city of about 41,000 has set aside 5 acres for development of affordable housing adjacent to its forthcoming signature Story Mill Park, Benepe noted. The city broke ground on the project over the weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, D.C., organizers of the 11th Street Bridge Park, a $45 million proposal that would transform a dormant bridge into recreational space, have drawn up an "equitable development plan" that sets goals for affordable housing and job creation for residents in a low-income neighborhood near the project. The non- profit Local Initiatives Support Corp. has committed to spend $50 million to support groups providing affordable housing, early childhood education, food support and other services in area around the park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founders of the High Line in New York City -- the much- ballyhooed 1.45-mile trail built on abandoned railway on the lower West Side that was the forerunner to The 606 and similar "rails to trail" projects springing up throughout the USA and beyond -- last year launched the High Line Network, a consortium that includes representatives from 19 adaptive reuse park projects across North America to help more easily share lessons learned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The High Line, which opened in 2009, saw property values spike 103% for real estate within a five-minute walk from the trail from 2003 to 2011, according to New York City government data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dazzling park, which has drawn more than 20 million visitors as of July 2014, has been criticized for becoming a tourist magnet rather than a neighborhood amenity. A study last year by Queens College political scientist Alex Reichl also found that fewer than 7% of High Line users were black or Latino -- a striking observation considering the trail was built near two public housing complexes with large black and Latino populations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I want to make sure other people don't make the mistakes we did," Robert Hammond, co-founder of the High Line, told the website City Lab earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chicago, three city council members last month proposed a pilot ordinance that would require developers to pay as much as a $650,000 fee if they want to demolish and replace habitable housing near parts of the 606 trail that have seen property values increase by 48% since 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money collected for the proposed Chicago program would go into an affordable housing trust, which would help homeowners pay for property taxes and home repairs. The ordinance appears to face an uphill battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the issues that the city government and funders should have foreseen is the accelerated gentrification, the accelerated increases in property values and taxes that we could have programmed for at the time," said Juan Carlos Linares, executive director of LUCHA, a Chicago affordable housing group that has backed the proposed ordinance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While real estate values in the neighborhoods around the trail have been rising for years, housing prices have risen sharply along the western segment of the trail that cuts through Humboldt Park and Logan Square neighborhoods -- areas that historically have large Latino populations and, until recent years, plenty of reasonably priced housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 606 has had a more modest influence on the already- gentrified neighborhoods on its eastern edge, but real estate prices on the once-affordable western side have skyrocketed by 48.2% since ground was broken on the trail in 2013 and by 9.4% during the first year the trail was open, according to a report in November 2016 from the Institute of Housing Studies at <span class="companylink">DePaul University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the six years before The 606's opening, 15% to 19% of single- family home sales went to investors and developers. In 2015, the year the trail opened, the figure reached 21%, and in the first quarter of 2016 it was almost 31%, the study found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's much more difficult to take action retroactively now that the market forces have already started to take force and gain momentum," said Geoff Smith, lead author of the <span class="companylink">DePaul</span> study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aides to Mayor Rahm Emanuel say his administration has worked to maintain affordable housing along the 606 corridor and help keep longtime residents in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the city created a $1 million forgivable loan program for lower-income home-owners on the western edge of The 606 to help them pay for needed exterior repairs as well as electrical, plumbing and heating fixes on their homes. The city has also created 33 affordable housing units near The 606.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We make sure that new developments, projects and resources, like the 606 trail, take into account the needs of the local community," Emanuel said in a statement to <span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coming week will be relatively quiet on the economy front, with Wall Street focusing some of its attention on the U. S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the prime home-selling season and investors will get the latest numbers on sales of existing homes and new ones, following lower-than-expected residential real estate sales in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a 2. 3% drop in sales of existing homes in April to an annualized pace of 5. 57 million units, analysts expect a similar sales pace in May when results are released Wednesday. Current projections are for a sales pace of 5. 55 million homes, a 0. 4% decline from April. Pending home sales, which reflect signed contracts that front-run existing home sales by four to six weeks (or the time for buyers and sellers to close on their deals), declined modestly in both March and April, according to Lewis Alexander, an economist at Nomura. That "portends a slowdown in existing home sales," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales pace has been slowed by a low supply of homes for sale, which tends to push prices higher, making them less affordable for many people. Still, with long-term interest rates that impact mortgages trending lower (despite the Federal Reserve's second increase of short-term interest rates in 2017 this past week), consumer demand for homes remains strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales declined 11. 4% in April, to an annualized pace of 569,000. However, when fresh May data is released Friday, a solid rebound is expected. Economists expect new home sales to jump 5. 5% to an annualized pace of 600,000 units. "It is possible that a blip in April was likely transitory," Alexander said in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The health of the housing market, of course, is dependent on multiple factors, such as borrowing costs, the health of the job market and worker wages, as well as the overall health of the U. S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, equity investors will continue to monitor the recent technology stock selloff, that has been centered mainly in the so-called FAANG stocks, which include <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and <span class="companylink">Google</span> parent Alphabet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street will also be analyzing economic conditions in the Eurozone. On Friday, a key reading on June manufacturing, known as the flash PMIs, will be released. Europe's improving growth has been viewed positively by investors. Analysts expect the Eurozone June flash PMI to be unchanged from May's level of 56. 8. Any number above 50 suggests growth not contraction.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Federal Reserve interest rate hike headlines a busy week of economic news. While the Fed is all but certain to raise its benchmark short-term rate by a quarter percentage point, markets will be eager to see whether Fed policymakers reaffirm a tentative plan for another rate increase later this year despite low inflation. Meanwhile, a batch of reports will shed light on May inflation, retail sales, industrial production and housing starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation has been surprisingly weak in recent months. The annual rise in the consumer price index retreated to 2. 2% in April from 2. 7% early this year and a core reading that excludes volatile food and energy dropped to 1. 9% from 2. 2%. (A different index of those measures that the Fed follows more closely also has declined and is below the Fed's 2% target) Falling gasoline prices likely restrained overall inflation again in May. For core prices, a decline in wireless phone service prices probably persisted last month, partly offsetting an increase in medical bills, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. Economists expect the Labor Department to report Wednesday that its consumer price index dipped to 2% annually in May from 2. 2% the prior month while core prices held steady at 1. 9%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales generally rebounded in March and April after sluggish readings early in the year that were largely traced to delayed tax refunds and warm weather that curtailed heating demand. Low gasoline prices and tepid auto sales likely held down overall sales last month, according to <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span>. Core sales -- which strip out volatile items such as autos and gasoline - probably rose moderately, Alexander says. All told, economists expect the Commerce Department to announce that retail sales increased just 0. 1% in May, and core sales jumped a solid 0. 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't expect much rate-hike drama at the close of a two-day Fed meeting. Markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the Fed will bump up its key rate by a quarter point to a range of 1% to 1. 25%, following similar moves in December and March. But several policymakers recently have voiced concerns about tepid economic growth and sluggish inflation. If a few Fed officials mark down their rate hike forecast, the median estimate could be lowered to just two increases this year. Fed officials also could provide more detail about plans to begin winding down the central bank's $4. 5 trillion balance sheet, a move that's likely to push up long-term rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell in April but that was due to a decline in volatile multifamily construction. Economists expect commerce on Friday to report a rebound in May, with starts rising 4. 3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1. 2 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James and Carrie Finan have been house-hunting in the Seattle area for four months in a seemingly futile race against time: They're living in a room in James' mother's house and their first child is due in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They've seen about 40 starter houses that match their criteria -- $350,000 or less, three bedrooms, about 1,200 square feet -- and made four offers ranging from $32,000 to $82,000 above asking price. They've lost out each time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every time we hear we're not getting it, my heart kind of sinks," James, 29, says. "It's been insane. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big reason the Finans are struggling is the regulatory morass faced by builders like Mike Walsh. On a parcel in Sammamish, Wash. , a Seattle suburb, he would like to build 36 relatively affordable houses. But since zoning changes in recent years permit just 25, he'll have to sell each at $1. 2 million to make the project profitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An increasingly byzantine maze of zoning, environmental, safety and other requirements partly accounts for housing construction that remains 35% below normal levels across the country, especially for affordable starter houses, builders and economists say. And that building deficit is the chief culprit behind a skimpy supply of both new and existing homes that has driven up prices about 40% the past five years, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. Rising prices are good for homeowners but shut out many buyers, especially Millennials shopping for their first house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other reasons single-family home construction is still sluggish: Builders are coping with shortages of lots and construction workers. And many banks have been reluctant to lend since the housing crash in the mid-2000s. Also, many builders have been loath to take on riskier projects since the bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while experts have long suspected that regulations were a deterrent for builders, new studies show more starkly that areas with the most rules - particularly big metro regions on the East and West coasts -- have the least housing construction. Some of the regulations aim to make homes safer or help neighborhoods deal with heavier rainfall and congestion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> last year found that from 2011 to 2016, regulatory costs to build an average house had increased from about $65,000 to $85,000, or 30%, and continue to make up a quarter of the price of a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jess Zimbabwe,who oversees land-use issues for the <span class="companylink">National League of Cities</span>,an advocacy group for municipalities, argues that regulatory costs make up a relatively small portion of rapidly rising home prices in the largest cities, and labor and land costs are by far the biggest construction expenses nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new analysis of 189 metro areas by Federal Reserve economist Raven Molloy finds that, in the top third of most-regulated areas,27% of owner-occupied homes are affordable to low- to moderate-income buyers. In the lowest third of least-regulated areas, 67% are affordable for that group. Regions with the most regulations and fewest starter homes include coastal cities like Baltimore, Boston and Seattle as well as Denver, Fresno, Calif. and Phoenix. Areas in the South and Midwest -- including Fort Wayne, Ind. ; Myrtle Beach, S. C. ; and Des Moines, Iowa -- have the fewest regulations and the most affordable units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many areas that have greater regulation also have strong job growth, which can push up home prices as well. But economically vibrant cities like Atlanta and Houston have fewer regulations and more affordable homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expenses faced by developers and builders include applying for zoning approval; meeting environmental and energy-efficiency standards; water and sewage hookup fees; and thecost of delay as developers pay property taxes and interest on loans while land sits empty. Many municipalities have increased minimum lot sizes and set aside more land for open space, which means fewer homes. They have also imposed rising "impact fees" on developers to defray the cost of widening roads to handle more traffic, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Seattle area, Walsh says, new laws require many homes, such as those that are larger or far from hydrants, to have fire sprinkler systems at a cost of $7,000 to $10,000 per home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, federal and state rules mandate that builders protect streams, ponds and wetlands, as well as a growing list of 1,447 endangered or threatened species that may reside on the property. Builders also must install ever more elaborate storm water retention facilities so as not to overwhelm sewers or pollute rivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walsh, who owns Terrene Ventures, says that about a decade ago he routinely built a retention pond that would occupy three lots at a new housing complex in the Seattle area at a cost of $1,000 per house. Now, he must build a concrete "vault" that takes up eight to 10 lots and costs $10,000 to $15,000 per house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zimbabwe says the facilities are needed because climate change has intensified the ferocity of storms, and the spread of developed land increases water runoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It takes Walsh about nine months to get local, state and federal approvals for a development, up from three months 15 years ago, he says. Walsh, who builds 30 to 50 homes a year, figures he could put up perhaps twice as many if the time and costs to apply for the government blessings had not mushroomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russell Hokanson, head of Seattle King County Realtors, a trade group, cites other reasons for the region's housing shortage, including its status as a technology hub and the third-best jobs engine in the country as of April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he adds, "We are feeling the pinch now and all the regulations that slow down (efforts) to get product into the market" are a big factor. The area has the country's fastest rising home prices. Houses get snapped up, staying on the market less than a month, on average, compared with a 4. 2 month average nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sammamish Mayor Don Gerend, says that since the early 2000s, the town has lowered the number of homes permitted on a parcel of land, and impact fees have risen to become the highest in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we're going to have more growth here, it shouldn't be to the detriment of people who live here," Gerend says. He says the town's main roads aren't equipped to handle a large increase in traffic. An area in town, he says, is zoned for denser housing, including townhouses, condos and apartments, but not single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zimbabwe defended the added requirements across the country "There are dozens of valid public policy goals - environmental sustainability, economic inclusion protecting property values," for existing property owners," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with the higher costs, some builders simply abandon projects or put up pricier homes in order to maintain profit margins. A study of the Boston area in the Journal of Urban Economics concluded that each new rule reduces housing construction the following year by about 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a large number of ways to shut housing down, or to slow the process so that developers just give up," says Edward Glaeser, a Harvard University economist and co-author of the study. Glaeser has said existing homeowners, the constituents of municipal officials, generally oppose new developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, builders respond by going ahead with a development but constructing more expensive houses, as Walsh is doing, says Robert Dietz, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, entry-level homes made up 9. 9% of newly constructed houses from 2010 to 2015, down from 16. 8% from 1997 to 2016, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a real estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Trulia</span> Chief Economist Ralph McLaughlin points out that other factors are likely at work as well. For example, large coastal cities have fewer available lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers are undeterred. The ESG Companies has sought for nearly 30 years to put up 1,000 dwellings, including 500 starter houses, on a parcel in Chesapeake, VA. Although the state cleared the firm's plan to preserve wetlands, the <span class="companylink">U. S. Army Corps of Engineers</span> disagreed with the wetland delineation, rejected the company's proposals to further mitigate the impact on wetlands and asked it to consider alternative properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After spending $20 million on surveys, tests and other expenses, ESG is still awaiting approval of a scaled-down version of the complex. "It's very frustrating," says ESG Vice President Michael Gelardi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Finans have lowered their standards and would now be content to land a two-bedroom house within about 20 miles of the city. But with their new baby on the way, if they don't close the deal by the end of July, "We're going to start looking at renting," James says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are heady days for American home sellers, with a report Tuesday showing that housing prices in March recorded their largest annual increase in nearly three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the gains are inflicting more financial pain on home buyers, though the price run-up has fallen well short of the annual double-digit increases during the mid-2000s housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices across the U. S. were up 5. 8% annually in March, up from 5. 7% the prior month, according to the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller national index. Driving the increase were a longstanding shortage of both new and existing homes combined with steady job and income growth that's prompting more Americans to buy houses for the first time or trade up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of price gains has accelerated in 2017 after year-over-year increases held fairly steady at a healthy 5% or so from 2014 to 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Home buyer demand is sky high, inventory levels are near rock-bottom and home prices keep rising,” says Svenda Gudell, chief economist of real estate research firm Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More on the housing market:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U. S. home equity is back, so why aren't more people borrowing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">15 zip codes with the most underwater properties</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P Case-Shiller's 10- and 20- city indices, which track the largest metro areas, increased 5. 2% and 5. 9% from a year ago, respectively, unchanged from February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a monthly basis, the national index rose 0. 3% seasonally adjusted while the 10- and 20-city indices each increased 0. 9%. Seventeen of the 20 cities reported monthly increases after seasonal adjustment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle again led the nation with a 12. 3% year-over-year gain in home prices, followed by Portland at 9. 2% and Dallas at 8. 6%. Half the areas in the 20-city index rose by more than 6%. New York posted the smallest gain at 4. 1% which was still double the rate of inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, there’s a 4. 2-month inventory of existing homes for sale, down from 4. 6 months a year ago and a normal level of about six months, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People are staying in their homes longer rather than selling and trading up,” says David Blitzer, managing director of S&amp;P Dow Jones’ index committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If mortgage rates, currently near 4%, rise further, this could further deter more people from selling and keep pressure on inventories and prices. ” He adds “there’s no way to tell” when rising prices and mortgage rates will cool off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gudell says price increases should moderate as builders add more supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national index is now 1. 3% above its 2006 peak while the 10-city and 20-city indices are still 7. 6% and 5. 4% below their 2006 highs, respectively.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Portland, Ore., are soaring. On a monthly basis, the local newspaper catalogs homes that sold above list price. The latest installment includes 34 homes that sold for 15% to 42% over list price in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly two dozen other major metropolitan areas are experiencing rising prices as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're looking for an explanation, look no further than the inventory of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a general rule, home prices rise when the number of homes for sale equals less than the previous six months' worth of actual home sales in that market. So, if there are 1,000 homes for sale in a particular city and 500 homes sell each month, the inventory is equal to two months' worth of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest figure in Portland is 1.6 months, which is well below the six-month threshold. Across the country more generally, the supply of homes for sale equals 5.7 months' worth of sales.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An interest rate hike at the Federal Reserve's June meeting seemed all but certain until St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard on Friday suggested the central bank's rate increase timetable may be "overly aggressive. " Minutes of the Fed's May 2-3 meeting, out this week, could clarify Fed officials' conflicting messages. Economic reports this week will also highlight new and existing home sales, business investment and a revised estimate of economic growth in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales had a nice run in the first quarter, in part because of a skimpy supply of existing homes and warm weather that encouraged house hunters to search for new digs. But that burst likely spells some moderation in April. Nomura economist Lewis Alexander notes permits for single-family home construction fell recently. Economists estimate the Commerce Department will report Tuesday that new home sales fell 1% last month to a still solid seasonally adjusted annual rate of 615,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales have been more volatile amid the weather swings and the limited inventory. After jumping 4. 4% in March, economists look for a pause in April. They reckon the National Association of Realtors will announce Wednesday that home sales slipped 0. 7% to a still healthy annual rate of 5. 7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its early May meeting, Fed policymakers did everything they could to shrug off recent weakness in the economy. Although the economy grew at an annual rate of just 0. 7% in the first quarter, they described the slump as "transitory. " And an unusual slide in annual inflation was downplayed in favor of longer-term price increases that have run close to the Fed's 2% annual target. On Friday, however, Bullard highlighted the economy's generally sluggish annual growth pace of about 2%, the recent retreat in inflation and his doubts that the low 4. 4% unemployment rate will force employers to bid up wages enough to move the needle on inflation. Minutes of the Fed meeting could shed light on whether other Fed officials share Bullard's concerns, a view that would cast doubt on an anticipated June rate hike and Fed plans for a total two more increases this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment has rebounded recently amid the energy sector's revival and an improving global economy. Economists figure that upswing continued in April. They expect Commerce to report Friday that core capital goods orders excluding aircraft and defense -- a proxy for capital spending -- rose 0. 5% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the economy turned in a weak performance early this year, recent economic data suggest it may have been slightly better than believed. Commerce has upgraded its estimate of first-quarter retail sales, which were constrained by delays in tax refunds. Economists expect Commerce to revise up its estimate of first-quarter growth to 0. 9% from 0. 7%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A solid retail sales report last week fueled hopes that consumer spending is perking up in the current quarter, a shift that's expected to drive a rebound from meager economic growth the first three months of the year. Data this week should reveal whether the housing sector and manufacturing will also be positive contributors to growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homebuilder sentiment has been healthy, partly because contractors are buoyed by President Trump's vows of tax cuts and deregulation. In addition, consumer demand for new homes has held up amid steady job and income growth, and house-hunting traffic and mortgage applications have been elevated, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. At the same time, construction has been tempered by a limited supply of lots that can be developed, a labor shortage and rising construction costs. Cost could edge up further after the White House slapped Canada with countervailing duties on its lumber shipments to the U. S. , a move that was denounced by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> (NAHB). All told, economists expect NAHB to report Monday that its index of builder sentiment held steady at a solid 68 in May, down somewhat from the recent high of 71 in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While builders are upbeat, housing starts have been choppy this year. Unusually warm winter weather pulled forward many starts to January and February, which led to a decline in March. Alexander reckons the robust labor market spurred a comeback in April, noting single-family building permits, a signal of future starts, have been strong. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Tuesday to report a 3. 2% rise in housing starts to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1. 3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production also has been volatile. Early in the year, the warm weather suppressed household demand for utilities, offsetting factory output that has been bolstered by an improving global economy and energy sector. In March, the opposite occurred as a surging utility demand more than made up for a drop in factory production. In April, all areas seemed to be pulling in the same direction. Manufacturing output likely rebounded while utility usage climbed steadily and oil and gas output picked up, Alexander says. Economists expect the Federal Reserve to announce that industrial production rose a sturdy 0. 5% in April.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earnings were strong as well. Net income rose to $2 billion, or $1. 67 per diluted share at the start of the year, compared with $1. 8 billion, or $1. 44 per diluted share, during that quarter in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong quarterly performance stood in sharp contrast to the dismal results of several other retailers, such as <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> and <span class="companylink">J. C. Penney</span>, whose store traffic has slipped as a growing number of consumers shop online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s growth in profits comes during a good stretch for the housing industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homebuilder sentiment has been healthy, partly because contractors are buoyed by President Trump's pledges of tax cuts and deregulation. Demand for new homes has held up as job and income growth remain steady, and house-hunting traffic and mortgage applications have been elevated, according to Nomura economist Lewis Alexander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction, however, has been tempered by a limited supply of lots that can be developed, a labor shortage and rising costs. Costs could edge up further following the White House decision to impose duties on Canada for its lumber shipments to the U. S. .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While builders are upbeat, housing starts have been choppy this year. Unusually warm winter weather pulled forward many starts to January and February, which led to a decline in March. Housing starts unexpectedly fell 2. 6% in April, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, but that was led by apartment construction, which is volatile. Single-family starts rose modestly.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What housing recovery?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only about one-third of U.S. homes have topped their pre- recession price peaks, undermining other measures that have shown average national housing prices zooming past those high-water marks, according to a new study by real estate research firm <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The U.S. housing market hasn't recovered," says Ralph McLaughlin, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s chief economist. "When you actually look at the value of any individual house, you're much more likely to find houses that haven't reached their" previous highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make no mistake -- the housing market has clawed its way out of the depths of the mid-2000s crash. The median U.S. home price was $196,500 in March, up from $151,900 at the market nadir in April 2012, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> figures show. And the vast majority of homes are worth more than what current owners paid for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet some homeowners may be waiting for prices to climb back to their prior tops before selling, which could be helping to constrain the number of homes available in the market, McLaughlin says. These unusually low inventories, in turn, are driving up prices, which ultimately could spur those homeowners to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Trulia</span> looked at the market value of each home and compared it to its pre-recession peak. By contrast, <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices</span> and the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> calculate average price changes that give more weight to expensive homes. S&amp;P found its index exceeded its July 2006 peak last November, and the finance agency's measure reached the milestone a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s study concludes that just 34.2% of homes nationally have surpassed their previous highs, some metro areas have recovered from the housing crash, particularly in the West and South. Many of these places have benefited from strong job, income or population growth, such as technology hubs Denver, San Francisco and Portland, Ore., each of which has seen more than 90% of homes exceed their pre-recession records. A low vacancy rate on homes for rent or sale also tends to push up prices sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver, the housing recovery leader with 98.7% of homes at new peaks, average income has increased 20% since the recession ended in 2009, the second-biggest rise among the 100 largest metro areas. During this period, the city's population has grown a healthy 13.7% and its median home price has soared 50% from its pre-meltdown record to $356,749 as of December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most homeowners feel (the price run-up) is a security blanket," says Steve Danyliw, a Denver broker with Danyliw &amp; Associates. Many, he says, are taking out home-equity loans to pay for expenses such as their children's college education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Trulia</span> has found that income growth has been the most significant factor since it determines whether buyers can afford to bid up for their dream home. Like Denver, areas such as San Francisco, Nashville, Austin and Seattle have had both the sharpest income gains and the most pervasive price recoveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others areas -- including Tulsa, Dallas, Nashville and Wichita -- never had a big price run-up during the housing boom. As a result, prices in those spots didn't fall sharply in the bust or face a steep climb in setting a new peak. Some of those areas also have enjoyed healthy job and income growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in 28 of the 100 metro areas, fewer than 10% of homes have eclipsed their housing bubble values. Those include regions that rode the real estate boom, tumbled hard in the crash and are still well short of their peak despite solid recoveries, including Las Vegas, Tucson, Fort Lauderdale and Riverside, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also lagging are communities in the Rust Belt and Northeast that have endured heavy manufacturing job losses or sluggish population growth, including Kenosha, Wis., Camden, N.J., and New Haven, Conn. In Cape Coral, Fla., the epicenter of the housing run-up and bust, just 5.9% of homes in the area have topped their pre-recession high.</p>

</div><div class="author">Rhonda Abrams; Rhonda Abrams </div><div>794 words</div><div>26 April 2017</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2017 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women small business owners are saving America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic recovery has been a long, slow slog. Without women starting businesses, wed all be in much tougher shape. Here's why: Women start businesses at a rate five times faster than men. In fact, women launch 1000 new businesses every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women would do a whole lot more to save America if only America would return the favor and treat women small business owners equally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday, April 30, kicks off National Small Business Week, a time to recognize the many contributions of small business owners. This year, let's focus on the critical role women business owners make in keeping our economy afloat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the recession, new businesses and jobs have grown slowly. Women-owned businesses have been a beacon of hope: theyve grown five times faster than the national average, according to The sixth annual State of Women-Owned Businesses Report, commissioned by <span class="companylink">American Express</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2007-2016, all new business formation had a 9% annual growth rate, while women-owned businesses formed at a 45% annual growth rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* 11. 3 million women owned businesses</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Those businesses provided nearly 9 million jobs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* And those businesses generated $1. 6 trillion in revenue -- that's trillion, with a "T"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minority women start businesses at the fastest rate within all women-owned businesses. Between 2007 and 2016, women of color launched nearly eight out of every 10 women owned businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture is not all rosy. While women now own 38% of the nation's companies, they only employ 8% of the private sector workforce (up from 6% nine years ago) and only contribute 4% of the country's overall revenues -- a figure unchanged in 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? Why with all this entrepreneurial spirit and drive, why aren't women business owners reaching greater parity in terms of employment and revenues? Part of the reason may be personal choice, but women business owners face substantial external obstacles keeping them from achieving their full potential when they want to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are some stumbling blocks in women entrepreneurs' paths?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lack of affordable, quality childcare. Without affordable, quality child care, it's not only more difficult for women to run growth-oriented companies, its difficult to retain and advance female employees. The founder of Kinko's, Paul Orfalea, made child care a major initiative of his charitable foundation because he realized lack of childcare was the number one reason valued female employees could not show up for work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lack of funding. Women receive a much smaller share of financing from all funding sources. Venture capital levels are almost laughable for women: Less than 3% of venture dollars went to women in 2016 and 5,839 male-founded companies received VC funding compared to a measly 359 female-founded companies, according to venture tracker Pitchbook, as reported by Fortune. When funded, they get less money: an average of $77 million compared to $100 million for males, according to Bloomberg. Similar disparities exist with angel investors and with lenders from all sources. According to lending site Fundera, women business owners get offered smaller loans for shorter terms at higher interest rates than men.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Persistent negative perceptions of successful women. Even today, a confident and successful woman is often seen as unpleasant -- not feminine enough. A confident man who promotes his abilities is rarely seen as cocky. The same behavior in a female is seen as bossy, pushy. This negative attitude towards strong women holds women back. Male funders are often less comfortable with overtly capable women than men. Women themselves become more reticent to tout their accomplishments and strengths, afraid to be seen as unlikable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bro culture and sexism. There's been a lot of high profile sexual harassment cases in the news: Bill OReilly, Uber executives, even the president. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. The business world rewards companies that embrace a culture of unrepentant sexism and coddle, even celebrate, men who act like the worst jerks in junior high, making it more difficult for women to get the experience in top startup jobs, get promoted or funded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What can entrepreneurs do to help combat these obstacles?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Support politicians who support women's issues, including child care 2. Create and support networks of women entrepreneurs 3. Mentor young female entrepreneurs 4. If you're a successful woman, consider becoming an angel investor5. Stay positive about other strong, successful women</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decades-long trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada has re- emerged, possibly affecting new home prices and triggering concerns of brewing tension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said late Monday the department's investigation has found that Canada has been improperly subsidizing its softwood lumber exporters, and the U.S. will begin collecting tariffs on shipments crossing the border. Rates will vary, with one Canadian company paying 3% and others paying typically about 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian imports to the U.S. -- valued at about $5.7 billion in 2016 -- make up about 30% of all softwood lumber used in U.S. residential housing construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, which has been lobbying against the lumber tariffs, criticized the move and said it would result in higher prices for newly built homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. lumber producers say subsidized -- and cheap -- Canadian imports have driven U.S. producers out of business and tariffs will reinvigorate the industry and generate more jobs. "It's creating a level playing field," says Zoltan van Heyningen, executive director of the U.S. Lumber Coalition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tariffs are the latest evidence of President Trump's increasing pressure on Canada as he looks to negotiate the <span class="companylink">North American Free Trade Agreement</span>, the 23-year old trade deal among the U.S., Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech in Wisconsin last week, he criticized Canada over a lingering dispute over ultra-filtered milk, a concentrate used to make cheese. Trump repeated the criticism Tuesday on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, saying "Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this. Watch!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a press conference, Ross deflected any possibility of a trade war with Canada, saying the disputes are isolated to the lumber and dairy industries. "We look forward to constructive discussions with Canadians as we get into <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questions to consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Why did the Trump administration decide to impose tariffs on Canadian lumber?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Disputes between U.S. lumber producers and their Canadian rivals have been going on for decades. The last trade agreement between the U.S. and Canada, the Softwood Lumber Agreement, expired in 2015. And American producers have been asking for an investigation into what they consider unfair subsidies the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> offers its lumber industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, forest lands are owned mostly by the government. Canadian provinces boost lumber producers' competitiveness by charging them reduced royalty rates for cutting trees, U.S. lumber producers say. In its investigation, the Commerce Department agreed and concluded that subsidies to Canadian producers ranged from 3% to 24%. "It's artificially adjusted down every time the market is facing pressure," van Heyningen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., forest lands are privately owned, and royalty rates are set by market forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: How would the tariffs affect consumers in the U.S.?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Depends on whom you ask, but an increase in newly built homes is likely. The <span class="companylink">NAHB</span> says a 19.9% tariff would result in a 6.4% increase in prices paid by U.S. consumers. The price of a single- family home would increase by $1,236, it says. "This is going to increase the cost of construction of residential houses," said Jerry Howard, CEO of NAHB. "Producers will try to pass on the cost to consumers if they can."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures are exaggerated, van Heyningen says. The lumber that's subject to the tariffs makes up about 2% of production costs of U.S. homes, he says. He estimates the price increase for American consumers would be only about 10% of the price increase estimated by the <span class="companylink">NAHB</span>. As for jobs, he adds, "If you have fair trade, you'd have more U.S. producers using U.S. workers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Trump is also criticizing Canada over its policies that protect its dairy farmers. Are the issues related?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: While specifics of the issues are different, they point to the Trump administration's concerns that Canada continues to protect certain industries even with <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> ostensibly promoting free trade. "They are generally a good neighbor. That doesn't mean they don't have to play by the rules," Ross said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada long has protected the country's dairy industry by levying tariffs on imports. But ultra-filtered milk from the U.S. had been an exception, and the cheaper American imports were popular among Canadian processors. But a year ago, Ontario, Canada's most populous province, changed rules so local processors can buy ultra-filtered milk from Canadian producers at lower prices, thus quickly weakening demand for U.S. milk products.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market takes center stage in a light week of economic news, with reports on new construction and existing home sales. The strengthening manufacturing sector will also be tested in the latest reading on industrial production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose to a four-month high in February despite higher mortgage rates, driven by the strongest pace of single-family home building since 2007. But that performance was likely inflated by unusually warm winter weather that pulled forward starts to early in the year. Some offsetting weakness, as well as much lower temperatures and snowstorms that hit the Midwest and Northeast, were expected to hamper new residential construction in March. Economists estimate the Commerce Department will report Tuesday that housing starts fell 2. 2% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1. 26 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production was flat in February but that was a byproduct of the relatively warm weather, which curtailed demand for utilities. Manufacturing output rose 0. 5% to an 8-½ year high as U. S. factories benefit from the oil sector's rebound and an improving global economy. The opposite dynamic was likely at play in March. The colder weather likely stoked heating demand while manufacturing output was expected to dip slightly, and oil and gas production continued a solid recovery, says <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span>. Overall, economists expect the Federal Reserve to announce that industrial production increased 0. 4% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the National Association of Realtors releases its latest report on existing home sales. Sales retreated in February after hitting a 10-year high the previous month. Low home supplies and rising prices and mortgage rates have tempered sales in many regions of the country, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. But demand remains strong as a result of healthy job and income growth and a large crop of Millennials who are itching to move out of their parents' basements. Pending home sales, which often foreshadow future transactions, advanced strongly in February and mortgage applications for home purchases also rose, Alexander notes. And the bad March weather appeared to have only a limited negative impact, he says. Economists estimate the Realtors group will record a 1. 3% rise existing home sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5. 6 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been hit by so many opposing forces it might be getting whiplash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the one hand, demand is strong. Job and income growth have been healthy and many Millennials are itching to move out of their parents' basements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the 3. 8-month supply of homes on the market is well below the six months considered balanced, leaving shoppers who don't act swiftly out of luck. That's curbing total sales. The tight supplies are also pushing up prices, which can further temper purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And 30-year mortgage rates, which are averaging 4. 08%, have fallen in recent weeks but are still up from 3. 47% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, the skimpy home inventories curtailed sales, which fell 3. 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in March, the robust housing demand likely outweighed the low supplies, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. The weather turned colder and stormier in March, but Alexander believes that had only a limited effect on sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while some buyers might be discouraged by rising prices and higher mortgage rates, those factors might nudge others to buy before costs rise further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander notes pending home sales, which often foreshadow future deals, have been strong. And mortgage applications have been up. All told, economists expect the National Association of Realtors to report Friday that existing home sales rose 1. 3% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5. 6 million.</p>

Sheryl Sandberg's new mission on Equal Pay Day: #20PercentCounts</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women earn 20% less than men so they will pay 20% less for some purchases on Equal Pay Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Clarifications: The 20% discount will be available to men as well as women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Lean In's Sheryl Sandberg is calling attention to the gender pay gap with a national retail campaign that will offer discounts to women on Equal Pay Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasoning behind the #20PercentCounts campaign that launches Tuesday: If a woman makes 20% less than a man, she should pay 20% less for the purchases she makes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three hundred local businesses in 25 cities will offer 20% discounts or special offers to women and men, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equal Pay Day is a symbolic point in the year that represents the date that working women's pay catches up to men's from the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women on average are paid 20% less than men in the U. S. , black women 37% less and Hispanic women 46% less, says Sandberg. For women of color, Equal Pay Day comes much later in the year. Black women have to work until July 31 and Hispanic women until November 2 to catch up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little progress has been made in narrowing the gap since President John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act more than a half century ago, says Sandberg, founder of LeanIn. org and chief operating officer of Facebook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pennies," she told USA TODAY in an interview. "Pennies. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The #20PercentCounts campaign was spearheaded by Lean In circles, the peer support groups that sprang from Sandberg's 2013 bestseller Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead. This is the fourth year of the campaign for Lean In DC, which came up with the idea, and the first year it has gone national, says Hilary Badger, who sits on Lean In DC's executive board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Panbury's Pie Cafe in Atlanta, Georgia, Builders' Hardware in East Lansing, Mich. , Found Coffee in Los Angeles and Wiley's Comedy Joint in Dayton, Ohio, are among the local businesses offering 20% discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National partners for the Lean In campaign are LUNA, Lyft, <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble</span> and <span class="companylink">Salesforce</span>. LUNA is offering 20% off of bars sold on its website from April 3 to April 11. Lyft is donating 20% of ride fares on Tuesday to organizations that help women and families. <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble</span> is offering a rebate on some products. <span class="companylink">Salesforce</span> donated in-store signage, online advertising and local events, according to Lean In.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To see businesses take a stand, this is how we value women's labor, is really exciting," says Badger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Lean In, shortchanging women's paychecks unfairly penalizes women and their families, reducing how much they can spend on groceries to how much they can put away for their children's education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the pay gap were erased, the average woman would make $530,000 more over the course of her career, and millions of women and families would be lifted out of poverty, Lean In says. Practically speaking, that means women on average could afford 78 more weeks of groceries each year. Black and Hispanic women could afford 155 additional weeks and 193 additional weeks of groceries, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to understand that the pay gap is happening to women and men with similar jobs that require similar skills and similar educational levels -- and that has a real impact," Sandberg said. "The number of working women living in poverty would be cut in half if women were just paid the same as men. So this is important for our businesses and this is important for our country. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few people dispute there's a wage gap, but not everyone believes it's as wide as Sandberg does. The Census Bureau says women earn 79 cents for every dollar that men earn, based on the median salaries of full-time workers. When it comes to weekly and hourly wages, the gap isn't as great, according to the Labor Department's <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some differences between women's and men's paychecks can be explained by factors including the average woman has less work experience than the average man, women take time off to raise children and they choose careers that tend to have more flexible hours and lower earning potential. But part of the gender pay gap can't be accounted for and stubbornly pops up in a range of occupations and industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sandberg, who has spoken out frequently on the wage gap, says her company, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, conducts frequent audits to make sure it pays women and men equally. Her hope: that publicity from the #20PercentCounts campaign will spur more action, maybe even legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of states have enacted equal pay laws. California, home base to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, has one of the nation's toughest, requiring companies to prove they pay women and men equally for similar jobs. But proposed federal legislation, known as the the Paycheck Fairness Act, has repeatedly stalled in Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shareholders are getting more aggressive in pressuring companies, including <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, on equal pay. Still, surveys show the gender pay gap is a big problem in the technology industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to raise the federal minimum wage law. Two-thirds of minimum-wage workers are women. We need better public policy. We need businesses to do the audits they should be doing. We need individuals to be aware of this," Sandberg said. "There is a lot to do. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visitors to LeanIn. org's website will find data on the pay gap in the U. S. and globally as well as steps that companies can take to make sure they pay women fairly. A campaign video from Funny or Die and <span class="companylink">Hulu</span> posted there imagines a woman's day with 20% less of everything, from coffee to smartphone batteries.</p>

Sheryl Sandberg: Four years after 'Lean In' women are not better off</span>
</div><div class="author">Jessica Guynn; Jessica Guynn </div><div>1485 words</div><div>29 March 2017</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2017 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bestselling author and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> executive tells USA TODAY women are facing pushback in drive for equality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sheryl Sandberg's bestseller Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead launched a national conversation on gender in the workplace and an online community of millions of working women ready to bulldoze the barriers they face, from being paid less and promoted less frequently, to carrying an uneven split of the housework and child care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years later, Sandberg says working women are no better off. They are facing pushback in business and in politics, both in the U. S. and around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, says Sandberg, "the energy around equality" and the growth of Lean In circles, small support groups inspired by the book and the ongoing work of LeanIn. org to empower women and their ambitions, give her hope that change is coming, if not in the next four years, sooner than we expect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview with USA TODAY for Women's History Month, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s No. 2 executive says she has reshaped some of her thinking on feminism in the workplace after being criticized for only speaking to a very specific group of women--highly educated, skilled professionals frequently privileged by their race--and excluding many lower income women, women of color and single mothers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, she says, the election of Donald Trump has made the drive for workplace equality as urgent as ever. Topping her agenda: equal pay, a hike in the federal minimum wage, paid family leave and maternity leave. The interview has been condensed and edited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: It has been four years since the publication of Lean In. Are we better off or worse off four years later?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: In terms of women in leadership roles, we are not better off. We are stuck at less than 6% of the Fortune 500 CEO jobs and their equivalent in almost every country in the world. There were 19 countries run by women when Lean In was published. Today there are 11. Congressional numbers have inched up a tiny bit. And so, overall, we are not seeing a major increase in female leadership in any industry or in any government in the world, and I think that's a shame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lean In Community is thriving and that gives me hope that this will change in the future. We have 1. 5 million members of our community, 33,000 circles in 150 countries, and we're growing by almost 100 a week. And we know that when people join circles, the great majority of them will do something that is much more ambitious for themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that there is so much energy around equality around the world and the fact that so many women are in circles gives me hope that this will change in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What progress do you hope to see women achieve and what will be be the single biggest factor in propelling that progress?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My goal is very clear, and I wrote about it in Lean In, which is that women run half our companies and countries and men run half our homes. As much as I wish that could happen in four years, I don't think that's a likely time period. But I think it can happen sooner than we think. Part of it is having that aspiration and that goal. I think we too often suffer from the tyranny of low expectations. Q: What have you learned since you published Lean In? At the time the book was enormously popular. But you also came under some criticism for being tone-deaf to your privilege as a wealthy, white, married woman with a big support system. How has that criticism reshaped your thinking on feminism and the workplace? (Sandberg's 47-year-old husband, Silicon Valley executive Dave Goldberg, died suddenly of a heart ailment in 2015).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: I posted publicly on Mother's Day last year that I think I didn't fully appreciate what it was to be a single mother. I certainly wrote about it in Lean In but I also wrote a whole chapter called "Make Your Partner a Real Partner," which for people who didn't have one must have been very hard to read.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have thought a lot about what it is to be a single mother because now I am one. And financially, I don't face the struggles that so many do. Thirty-seven percent of single mothers are living in poverty, 40% if you are black or Latina. That's unacceptable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Does the Lean In message resonate with millennial women who tend to be less trusting of corporate and political leaders than Gen Xers or baby boomers? How are you trying to reach them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: We have broad participation across age groups from college age up in Lean In circles. And I think the message does resonate, mostly because they want equality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the things that I think is working about the Lean In model is that Lean In is about peer support. These are millennial women, largely, working with millennial women to be ambitious in their own lives. Every millennial woman who joins a circle encourages every other millennial woman in her circle to reach out and reach higher and believe in herself. We make a difference person by person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Does this generation think differently than its predecessors about gender roles and identity?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: The reason I wrote Lean In is I think people weren't actually noticing that we had stopped making progress. I gave a TED talk and said: "It turns out men still run the world. " And the audience gasped as if that was news. I think we made so much progress for decades, starting in the 1960s and the 1970s on, that when really the progress stopped, it ground to a halt on leadership roles, on the pay gap, on the percentage of women who are running for office, we didn't exactly notice. So I think making sure we are correctly looking at where we are. You know, we are 20% in the Congress. We have never had a woman president. We are 5% of the Fortune 500 CEO jobs. Paying attention to that is the first step and understanding that that's not OK.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: You mentioned that we don't have a woman president. How has the election of Donald Trump affected women and the Lean In movement? What will be the most important issues for women during his administration?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: I am a longtime Hillary Clinton supporter. I was really disappointed that my children did not see a woman sworn in as president, even though they are young and so I am fully expecting they will, and I'd like it to be sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the issues we need to work on are as urgent as ever. We are the only developed country in the world that doesn't have paid maternity leave. The only one. We are one of the only developed countries in the world that doesn't have paid family leave. That's unacceptable. Two thirds of minimum-wage workers are women. Unacceptable. All of these things need to be fixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: The annual study of the state of women in corporate America that Lean In conducts with <span class="companylink">McKinsey &amp; Co</span>. has elevated issues of female leadership and gender diversity in the national conversation. Are you starting to see any results from it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: We know that companies are changing their policies because of our study. Almost two-thirds of companies that participated are planning to add new programs or update existing ones just based on last year's results. A lot of companies have this data themselves, but they don't know what to compare it to. Giving them a snapshot, here's where you are and here are best practices, we think will make a real difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Lean In has a partnership with the NBA that focuses on ways men can promote equality at home and at work. What's the idea behind the campaign and what kind of reaction have you gotten to the public service announcements?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: These ads run during NBA games and they run through the playoffs and through the finals. That's pretty incredible because what you get are men who look up to these NBA players and they are being told these NBA players are great fathers and great sons really believing in women's equality in the workplace. And we think that people model the behavior of the people they look up to, and to achieve equality we are going to need men on board and these are great role models for men.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American consumer takes center stage in a relatively light week of economic news. Reports will highlight the latest data on consumer confidence and spending, home prices, and the final estimate of economic growth in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American consumer takes center stage in a relatively light week of economic news. Reports will highlight the latest data on consumer confidence and spending, home prices, and the final estimate of economic growth in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence surged to a 15-year high in February on strong job and income growth and lofty stock and home values. But gasoline prices edged higher this month, notes <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span>. Economists estimate the Conference Board will report Tuesday that its index of consumer confidence dipped slightly in March but remained near the recent record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While climbing house prices have brightened the outlook of homeowners, they've made purchasing a house more challenging, especially for first-time buyers. Home prices in 20 of the largest metro areas were up 5. 6% annually in December, faster than the previous month's 5. 2% pace, according to the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller index. Low housing supplies have been pushing up prices, and there's little letup in sight. Economists reckon S&amp;P will report the index maintained its 5. 6% annual pace in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department left its initial estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth unchanged at a 1. 9% annual rate as business investment was weaker than first believed, offsetting stronger consumer spending. In its third and final estimate, Commerce will likely revise up business investment and stockpiling, says Lewis Alexander, Nomura's chief U. S. economist. But he says government spending could be trimmed. All told, economists expect Commerce to announce Thursday that the economy grew at a slightly faster 2% pace, in line with the recovery average and down from 3. 5% in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more recent snapshot of consumer spending comes Friday. Household outlays generally have been strong as consumers respond to the improved labor market and rising stocks. But retail sales slowed sharply last month, a shift that economists attributed to delays in tax refunds. That likely filtered into consumer spending overall, Alexander says, though he notes that outlays for services helped offset some of the weakness. Economists expect Commerce to report that consumer spending increased a modest 0. 2% in February.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has held up remarkably well, but rising mortgage rates and a limited inventory of existing homes are likely to test its resiliency over the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports this week on new and existing home sales will provide a snapshot of the market's performance in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales rose a healthy 3.2% in January despite a 3.6- month supply of units, lowest since January 2005. Still, the thin stockpile is taking some toll on sales and probably more than offset unusually warm weather in February, Nomura economist Lewis Alexander says. Mortgage rates actually dipped last month but, at about 4.17%, were still up from 3.47% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander notes that mortgage applications declined in February while pending home sales, an indicator of future transactions, were down the previous month. All told, economists estimate the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> will announce Wednesday that existing home sales fell 1.8% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, Alexander notes, the industry is grappling with a shortage of labor and construction materials. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Thursday to report a measured 0.9% increase in new home sales for February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment has started to bounce back from a downturn as a result of the recovering oil industry and improving global economy. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft -- a proxy for business capital spending -- fell 0.4% in January, but that came after three consecutive increases. Economists expect Commerce to report Friday that category jumped another 0.6% in February.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts post solid gain in February</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in February rose 3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.288 million, according to the Commerce Department. Housing starts are running 7.5% higher than during the first two months of 2016. Almost all of the gains were from construction of single-family houses, which rose 6.5% to an annual rate of 872,000. Multifamily starts fell by 3.7% to a pace of 416,000.</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson </div><div>Paul Davidson, @Pdavidsonusat, USA TODAY</div>
<div>814 words</div><div>13 March 2017</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FIRST</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2017 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riskier borrowers are making up a growing share of new mortgages, pushing up delinquencies modestly and raising concerns about an eventual spike in defaults that could slow or derail the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend is centered around home loans guaranteed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> that typically require down payments of just 3% to 5% and are often snapped up by first-time buyers. The <span class="companylink">FHA</span>- backed loans are increasingly being offered by non-bank lenders with more lenient credit standards than banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landscape is nothing like it was in the mid-2000s when subprime mortgages were approved without verifiying buyers' income or assets, sparking a housing bubble and then a crash. Still, for some analysts, the latest development is at least faintly reminiscent of the run-up to that crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have a situation where home prices are high relative to average hourly earnings and we're pushing 5%-down mortgages, and that's a bad idea," says Hans Nordby, chief economist of real estate research firm CoStar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of <span class="companylink">FHA</span> mortgage payments that were 30 to 59 days past due averaged 2.19% in the fourth quarter, up from about 2.07% the previous quarter and 2.13% a year earlier, according to research firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> and <span class="companylink">FHA</span>. That's still down from 3.77% in early 2009, but it represents a noticeable uptick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While that could simply represent monthly volatility, "the risk is that the performance will continue to deteriorate, and then you get foreclosures that put downward pressure on home prices," says Sam Khater, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>'s deputy chief economist. Such a scenario likely would take a few years to play out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The early signs of some minor turbulence in the mortgage market add to concerns generated by recent increases in delinquent subprime auto loans, personal loans and credit card debt as lenders target lower-income borrowers to grow revenue in the latter stages of the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">FHA</span> mortgages generally are granted to low- and moderate-income households who can't afford a typical downpayment of about 20%. In exchange for shelling out as little as 3%, <span class="companylink">FHA</span> buyers pay an upfront insurance premium equal to 1.75% of the loan and 0.85% annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">FHA</span> loans made up 22% of all mortgages for single-family home purchases in fiscal 2016, up from 17.8% in fiscal 2014 but below the 34.5% peak in 2010, <span class="companylink">FHA</span> figures show. The share has climbed largely because of a reduction in the insurance premium and home price appreciation that has made larger downpayments less feasible for some, says Matthew Mish, executive director of global credit strategy for UBS. House prices have been increasing about 5% a year since 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the nation's biggest banks, burned by the housing crisis and resulting regulatory scrutiny, largely have pulled out of the <span class="companylink">FHA</span> market as the costs and risks to serve it grew. Non-bank lenders, which face less regulation from government agencies such as the <span class="companylink">FDIC</span>, have filled the void.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-banks, including Quicken Loans and <span class="companylink">Freedom Mortgage</span>, comprised 93% of <span class="companylink">FHA</span> loan volume last year, up from 40% in 2009, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Meanwhile, the average credit score of an <span class="companylink">FHA</span> borrower has fallen modestly since 2013. Mish says non-banks generally have looser credit requirements, and lenders have further eased standards -- such as the size of a monthly mortgage payment relative to income -- as median U.S. wages stagnated even as home values marched higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the worry: If home prices peak and then dip, homeowners who put down just 5% and are less creditworthy than their predecessors will owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. That would increase their incentive to default, especially if they have to move for a job or face an extraordinary expense, Khater says. Foreclosures would trigger price declines that ignite more defaults in a downward spiral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In turn, funding for the non-bank lenders from banks and hedge funds likely would dry up, and <span class="companylink">FHA</span> loans would be harder to get, dampening housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, says such fears are unfounded, citing some complaints that <span class="companylink">FHA</span> mortgage standards are too rigorous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The non-banks (bring) a welcome change," he says. They must meet <span class="companylink">FHA</span> standards, he says, and are overseen by the <span class="companylink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bill Emerson, vice chairman of Quicken Loans, the top non-bank lender, says the credit standards of his firm and his peers are stringent by historical standards and seem looser only because banks tightened requirements after the housing crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't have any concerns about" a potential rise in bad loans, Emerson said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rampant sexual harassment is described in a class-action suit involving 69,000 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Almost 250 women and men describe one of the nation's largest jewelry companies, Sterling Jewelers, which operates under the name of <span class="companylink">Kay Jewelers</span> and Jared the Galleria of Jewelry, as a hotbed of sexual harassment in declarations as part of a long-running arbitration case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These documents suggest a culture that allowed and even encouraged sexual discrimination at every level. The circumstances described by current and former employees are terribly demeaning to women, not just because they were mistreated but because they saw their co-workers treated as sexual objects, too," Joe Sellers , a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said Tuesday in a statement to USA TODAY.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the declarations, he says, are reports of a rape, male managers cavorting in a swimming pool with topless female employees at a mandatory manager's conference and a witness who tells of a male manager suggesting that a female co-worker swipe a credit card between her breasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declarations, obtained by the Washington Post, depict Sterling Jewelers as fostering a workplace where senior men treated young saleswomen as their private harems, including groping, demeaning and demanding sex in return for better jobs and job security, the Post reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declarations are part of a private class-action arbitration case first filed in 2008. It alleged female employees at the conglomerate were routinely sexually harassed, paid less and passed over for promotion at Sterling, which operates close to 1,500 stores in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief executives of Sterling's parent company <span class="companylink">Signet Jewelers</span>, including CEO Mark Light, are among those accused of demanding sexual favors, according to documents filed in the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Post has been seeking access to the sworn statements for several years but it wasn't until Sunday night that the more than 1,300 pages of statements were released to the newspaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statements describe top male managers at the company sending "scouting" parties to stores to find female staffers to target for sex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The managers so frequently demanded sex from female workers in exchange for better positions within the company that there was an internal phrase for it -- "going to the big stage," the Post reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the allegations were also reported in a 2014 story in the New York Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The class-action case includes 69,000 current and former females employees of Sterling. However, David Bouffard, vice president for Signet Corporate Affairs, said in a statement to USA TODAY that "the arbitration matter contains no legal claims of sexual harassment. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sterling disputed the allegations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have thoroughly investigated the allegations and have concluded they are not substantiated by the facts and certainly do not reflect our culture," said Bouffard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the nine years since it was filed, the class-action suit has never included legal claims of sexual harassment or hostile work environment discrimination, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The only claims certified to proceed on a class-wide basis relate to alleged unintentional gender pay and promotions discrimination. Despite years of litigation, millions of pages of documentation and numerous depositions, claimants' counsel have chosen not to proceed with sexual harassment claims. These allegations are being publicized by claimants' counsel to present a distorted, negative image of the company," Bouffard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the allegations go back decades and "involve a very small number of individuals in a workforce of more than 84,000 during the class period," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Sellers said the conduct is "consistent with the evidence in this case that women were systematically paid less than men, even while performing more highly than men, and received fewer promotions that they should have. "</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 6,500 tickets listed on secondary ticket market websites as of Friday afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Hundreds of seats remain for Sunday's Daytona 500 through the track's website, although that's nothing like the inventory on the secondary ticket market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were more than 6,500 tickets listed on those websites as of Friday afternoon, the most available for purchase so close to the race since TicketIQ began tracking NASCAR's season-opening contest in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average prices have dropped 19% over the last three days to $209, according to TicketIQ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fact that there's more inventory available this year than in years past means that it will be cheaper than ever to see this historic event," TicketIQ spokesperson Jesse Lawrence said</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The get-in price, the cheapest seat available, on StubHub was $93, $2 less than the least-expensive face value ticket for the race. The most expensive tickets on the site were $550 for seats on the start/finish line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices for tickets sold on StubHub range from $75 to $750 for this year's race, a range that is about 25% lower than the final average sale prices a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've seen a lot more listings on StubHub for the Daytona 500 this year which has made it more of a buyer's market," StubHub spokesperson Cameron Papp said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the second Daytona 500 since the track underwent $400 million in the "reimagining" of Daytona International Speedway, which included the installation of 101,500 wider seats and several other renovations aimed at improving the fan experience. The track also removed about 45,000 seats during the renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvements created a bump in attendance and a boost of 17% in the average sale price for the race on tickets sold on StubHub from the 2015 Daytona 500.</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson; Paul Davidson </div><div>483 words</div><div>20 February 2017</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2017 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also this week: Reports on new and existing home sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told Congress last week that a March interest rate hike is at least on the table, the search is on for clues as to whether the Fed is likely to make a move that soon. Minutes of the Fed's early February meeting, out this week, will be Exhibit A. A light week of economic news also features reports on new and existing home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Yellen didn't tip her hand in testimony before the Senate banking committee, she did say that "every meeting is live," including the Fed's next gathering March 14-15. Investors remain complacent, with fed fund futures giving just 17% odds of a rate increase in March and 47% in June. But some encouraging economic data last week increased the chances of Fed action, economists say, including strong pickups in inflation and retail sales. The Fed raised its benchmark short-term rate in December for the first time in a year. Minutes of the Jan. 31-Feb 1 meeting, out Wednesday, could signal if another move is imminent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists also expect the meeting summary to reveal a discussion among Fed policymakers about when to start shrinking the Fed's bloated balance sheet. During and after the financial crisis, the Fed bought more than $3 trillion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to push down long-term interest rates. Now that the economy is healthy enough to begin raising short-term rates, some Fed policymakers believe the next step is to shrink the Fed's holdings, though Yellen last week gave no hint that's coming soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising interest rates could modestly restrain a housing market that has been one of the economy's bright spots. But while existing home sales hit a post-recession high last year, limited inventories have tempered the gains. In December, home sales fell 2. 8% amid a 3. 6-month supply of homes, lowest since 2005, Nomura economist Lewis Alexander says. A six-month stockpile is considered balanced. Yet noting that pending home sales and mortgage applications have been solid recently, Alexander expects a rebound in home sales for January. Economists expect the National Association of Realtors to report a 1. 1% rise in sales in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5. 6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason existing home supplies have been skimpy is the inadequate construction of new homes, partly because of a labor shortage. In December, new home sales fell 10. 4%. Yet Alexander points out that homebuilder sentiment remains high and the market is due for a bounce back. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Friday to report a 7. 3% increase in new home sales last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 575,000.</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson; Paul Davidson </div><div>397 words</div><div>25 January 2017</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2017 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are picking up their game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House flipping is back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flipping, defined as the sale of a home at least twice within a year, made up 6. 1% of all home sales in 2016, up from 5. 3% the previous year and the highest level since 2006, real estate research firm <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> says in a new report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend at least partly signifies rising prices that are attracting investors. The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday the median existing home price rose 4% last year, while the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller national index has shown slightly faster increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top markets were Las Vegas, with flips making up 10. 5% of all sales, followed by Daytona Beach, Fla. , at 9%; Tampa, at 8. 4%; and Memphis and Fresno, Calif. , both at 8. 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors are picking up their game after several years of flat or declining activity," says Ralph McLaughlin, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home flipping was the rage during the mid-2000s' housing bubble, and it cooled during the crash. Home prices increased at a double-digit rate in 2013 and 2014 as the market recovered from the downturn, but credit was still tight, forcing many investors to make all-cash purchases and limiting flips, McLaughlin says. Last year, he says, price gains were more moderate but flipping picked up because mortgages were more readily available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, in fact, found the correlation between rising prices and flipping was low-to-moderate in the 100 largest markets, compared to a high correlation in 2013 and 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means a larger share of investors are snapping up homes, making improvements and then selling them at a profit, rather than simply reaping the benefits of a price run-up, McLaughlin says. The result, he says, is improved housing stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, for example, 11. 6% of the houses flipped last year required a city permit for remodeling, the highest on records dating back to 2000, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean house flipping is a net positive for the market. It creates more competition for average homebuyers, at least temporarily. And while it provides more upgraded homes for some shoppers, it reduces the stock for those who can afford only low-priced units and plan to make the improvements themselves.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell in December amid historically low supplies and rising prices and mortgage rates but still closed out the best year in a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales decreased 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million from an upwardly revised 5.65 million in November, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday. Economists expected a 1.8% drop to 5.51 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline, however, came after three consecutive increases and a solid overall performance in 2016. A total 5.45 million existing homes were sold last year, up from 5.25 million in 2015 and the highest level since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Solid job creation throughout 2016 and exceptionally low mortgage rates translated into a good year for the housing market," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the realtors group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"However, higher mortgage rates and home prices combined with record low inventory levels stunted sales in much of the country in December."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, single-family home sales fell 1.8% and condominium and co-op sales slid 10.3%. Regionally, sales declined 6.2% in the Northeast, 4.8% in the West and 3.8% in the Midwest. Sales in the South were unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing supplies in late December tumbled 10.8% to 1.65 million, the lowest on records dating to 1999. Inventories have dropped for 19 months in a row and amount to a 3.6-month supply, down from the six months considered balanced. Yun blamed inadequate home construction. "More needs to be done to address the regulatory and cost burdens preventing builders from ramping up production," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skimpy inventory is expected to act as a headwind in coming months, economist Kristin Reynolds of <span class="companylink">IHS Markit</span> says. After the housing crash, many homeowners owed more on their mortgages than their homes were worth, though the share has fallen to about 10% from 29% in 2012. Still, some Americans are waiting to realize bigger equity gains before putting their homes up for sale, says Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist of real estate research firm Trulia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the crunch is likely to ease later this year. Reynolds notes homebuilder sentiment is strong, heralding more home construction that will provide current homeowners more choices. As they move, that should ease the bottleneck for first-time buyers. And McLaughlin says higher home values will coax more investors to sell units that are currently renting out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That should help moderate housing prices. The median home price was $232,200 in December, up 4% over the past year as the limited supplies and solid demand allowed homeowners to reap bigger gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, 30-year mortgages averaged 4.2% in December, up from 3.77% in November and the highest rate since April 2014. The average rate rose from 3.47% in late October to 4.32% in late December, but has fallen three consecutive weeks to 4.09%. Rates generally are expected to climb this year on anticipation of stronger inflation, fueled partly by President Trump's fiscal stimulus plan and <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> rate hikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the median home price was $232,200 in December, up 4% over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices and rates are discouraging first-time homebuyers in particular, who represented 32% of all sales last month, in line with their share for all 2016 and below the historical average 40% that tends to underpin growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It'll take more entry-level supply, continued job gains and even stronger wage growth for first-timers to make up a greater share of the market," Yun says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from expensive ask prices, nothing turns off a potential home buyer more than rising interest rates, as the higher the mortgage rate the higher the monthly mortgage payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates also impact affordability, as more expensive borrowing costs often force home buyers to purchase a cheaper home or downsize from a single-family home to, say, a condo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why Tuesday's report on December existing home sales and Thursday's on new home sales will be watched closely by Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in the final month of 2016 are seen coming in at an annualized rate of 5.53 million units, below the 5.61 million homes sold in November 2016, according to Bespoke Investment Group. A small drop in December sales of new homes also is seen. Economists forecast 585,000 new homes were sold last month, down from 592,000 in November 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December saw a sharp rise in mortgage rates as investors began to price in higher rates after the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> hiked short-term rates for the only time in 2016 at its December meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate on a conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgage climbed as high as 4.45% in December, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>, its highest level since spring 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big question now: Can an improving economy, more jobs and higher worker pay offset the downside of higher rates on home purchases going forward?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week brings the last significant snapshot of the U.S. economy in 2016. It's expected to show continued moderate growth, a solid housing recovery and a nascent rebound for business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales have been on a tear lately, rising for three consecutive months and notching the highest level in nearly a decade in November. That strong reading likely reflects homeowners who scrambled to lock in low borrowing costs before a rise in interest rates, Nomura economist Lewis Alexander says. But, he notes, pending home sales fell recently, indicating closings may have softened in December. Economists estimate the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> will announce Tuesday existing home sales dipped 1.1% last month to a still-solid seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales also have been healthy, recording a 5.2% jump in November. Sales of new homes represent about 10% of the total market but help set the course of housing starts, a driver of construction employment and economic growth. Single-family building permits, a harbinger of housing construction, picked up noticeably last month, suggesting "that demand in the housing market remained steady," Alexander says. Still, economists expect the Commerce Department to report Thursday that new home sales retreated slightly in December after the strong gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing has been a pillar of growth, weak business investment has been the economy's biggest drag for nearly two years. The oil-price crash hammered crude producers and a weak global economy and strong dollar hurt U.S. exports. But last year's climb in oil prices spurred the beginnings of a rebound for the oil industry. Capital orders for non-defense big-ticket items is down nearly 4% for the year but rose 0.9% in November and is up two consecutive months. Some economists think the development signals a turnaround. Economists reckon Commerce will report Friday that those capital goods orders increased 0.3% in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That rebound in business capital spending helped the economy grow at a 3.5% annual rate in the third quarter, its biggest gain in two years. In the fourth quarter, business investment likely posted another modest gain while company stockpiling added to growth for a second consecutive quarter, Alexander says. Meanwhile, consumer spending is set to post another solid increase, but weak exports probably tempered growth. <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span> says. Economists figure Commerce will report the economy grew at a 2.1% rate last quarter.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is expected to pick up moderately this year on steady job and income growth and an easing supply crunch, but rising mortgage rates are likely to temper the gains, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "X" factor is President-elect Donald Trump. Some of his proposed policies could juice home sales and starts more than anticipated, while others may constrain the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think 2017 is going to be another solid year" for housing, says Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist of real estate research firm Trulia. "But homebuyers will continue to face headwinds."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales are projected to increase 2% to a post- recession high of about 5.5 million in 2017, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. But that's less than last year's 3.3% gain and below the 5.75 million considered normal in light of population growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the chief stumbling blocks is the rise in mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since late October, the average 30-year rate has climbed from 3.47% to 4.32%, boosting the monthly payment on a $200,000 mortgage by $97. Yun estimates the rate will increase to about 4.6% by the end of 2017, adding another $34 to that monthly mortgage check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates are rising in anticipation of higher inflation under Trump's fiscal stimulus plan and faster interest rate hikes by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McLaughlin notes that with rents soaring in recent years, owning a home is still a far better deal than renting in most of the country. But as mortgage rates edge higher, Yun says some low- and moderate-income buyers will no longer qualify for a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People at the margins (will be) priced out," he says. He estimates the increase in rates over the next year will mean 400,000 fewer home sales than if borrowing costs were flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kendall Walker, a real estate agent at Redfin in Northern Virginia, says she hasn't yet seen customers ditch their house hunts because of higher rates. But she adds, "We've had some buyers come down in price" to offset the bigger mortgage burden, reducing the size of their dream homes by as much as 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, Yun says, steady job and pay gains will result in an overall pickup in home sales in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect current average annual earnings growth of 2.5% to approach 3% by the end of next year as the low, 4.6% unemployment rate forces employers to bid up for workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another positive development is the prospect of somewhat more ample supplies. There was a four-month inventory of homes nationally in November, according to the Realtors group, well below a healthy six-month stockpile. That has crimped sales and pushed up prices, which have risen 5% to 6% the past couple of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for the meager inventory: The housing crash left many homeowners owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth. Some have hesitated to unload their units until they realize bigger equity gains, McLaughlin says. Also, many investors snapped up cheap homes during the crisis and rented them out, leaving fewer on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as a result of rising prices, the share of homeowners who are "seriously underwater" fell to 10.8% in the third quarter from 29% in 2012, according to ATTOM Data Solutions and RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher home values also have prodded more investors to sell their units, a trend McLaughlin expects to continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home builders are expected to respond to the tight supplies by putting up more houses. Housing starts are estimated to increase 10% from 1.18 million in 2016 to about 1.3 million in 2017, according to a survey of 53 economists by Blue Chip economic Indicators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not too far from the 1.5 million deemed normal and well above the roughly 400,000 bottom in 2010. Yun says single-family home construction will drive the gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the fresh supplies hit the market, he predicts the current four-month inventory of existing homes will increase to five months by midyear, helping moderate annual home price gains from 5.5% in 2016 to about 4% in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would still outpace wage growth for many Millennial first- time homebuyers, a group that also will be particularly squeezed by higher mortgage rates.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Married in March, fired in September, and expecting our first baby in March 2017. I have $45k in credit card debt ($35k of which is 0% until July 2017), I own a property with a tenant, which cash flows $30/month. I have $121k in a Roth account that I recently rolled over. Finally, I'm starting a new career as a 100% commissioned real estate agent this month. Do I make a withdrawal to cover expenses for the first 6 months of my real estate career? A $37,500 distribution would net $30k. Our monthly expenses shortfall is ~$5k a month. - Tom, Pittsburgh</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom, somehow you strike me as a man of action - maybe it's your writing style. You also have a somewhat reasonable plan on the table, although you have a pretty significant detail wrong. We'll fix that detail here in a minute. But first, we must tackle the realities of beginning a 100% commission income career. If you stay disciplined and work your plan, you can rebuild your financial life. However, if you make too many false steps early in the game, you will make your problems worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, I've found true financial emergencies don't really come in events like a job loss. Instead, they come with people's reaction to unsettling events. Sure, losing your job six months after getting married stinks, but overreacting will make the situation much worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your goal should be to not overreact. Clearly, I don't know all the details of your job loss. But you've either survived over the last three months because of a severance package or you had an emergency fund. . No matter how you survived the last three months without a job, you survived. And better yet, you know exactly how much money you need each month to survive. It's also worth noting that it seems as though you lost a pretty high-paying job, around $85,00 to -$90,000 a year (my guess).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allow me to oversimplify your situation for a moment. All you need to do is to sell roughly $3 million worth of real estate (calculated at a net commission), to replace your previous income. The $30,000 nut you're considering withdrawing from your IRA is equivalent to $1 million in real estate sales. Like you, I'd rather you sell $3 million worth of real estate instead of $2 million. Neither of us want you to take money out of your Roth IRA right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now for the major detail you got wrong. You can withdrawal deposits you've made to a Roth IRA without tax consequences. You just can't withdrawal the earnings prior to age 59-1/2 without getting taxed and penalized. In other words, you don't need to withdrawal $37,500 to net $30,000. You only need to withdrawal $30,000. As long as you've contributed $30,000 to your Roth IRA and you can document it, you can withdrawal $30,000 from your Roth IRA without worrying about taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best plan of attack, if you're going to supplement your current income with Roth withdrawals, is to only withdrawal what you need each month. Don't take a giant withdrawal at the beginning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's make a visit to the truth tree. You might not make a dime in real estate sales in your first two months. If this possibility turns into your reality, withdraw the first two month's worth of expenses ($10,000) right now. If you happen to earn $4,000 in commissions in your third month, set money aside for taxes, and then take the rest as income</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $4,000 commission turns into $3,200 after setting aside 20% for taxes, and then you would supplement your income with $1,800 from your IRA. And just like that, you'd have the $5,000 you need to survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If your real estate career takes off quickly, once you create a degree of stability, consider replacing your Roth IRA withdrawals to help preserve your future. Talk to a tax accountant about the specific rules surrounding replacing your Roth withdrawal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, don't forget the three cardinal rules of real estate: location, location and replace your Roth IRA withdrawals.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rose Bowl isn't part of the College Football Playoff this year, although that has not tempered demand on the secondary ticket market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venerable contest in Pasadena, Calif. , featuring USC and Penn State was easily the most expensive ticket this bowl season as of Thursday, commanding more than a 30% premium over the average listing price of either the Peach or Fiesta Bowls, the two semifinal games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Rose Bowl is consistently one of the hottest bowl games of the year, it has topped the list three of the past four years," SeatGeek spokesperson Chris Leyden told USA TODAY Sports. "This season we have the combination of a very local team in USC and a fan base in Penn State that is very hungry for a major bowl game. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average list price on SeatGeek for the Rose Bowl was $418. The Peach Bowl (Alabama vs. Washington) had an average listing price of $288 and the average Fiesta Bowl (Clemson vs. Ohio State) listing price was $224, according to the seat tracking and sales site as of Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for the Peach and Fiesta Bowls have dropped significantly in recent days, according to information provided to USA TODAY Sports by TicketIQ. A week ago, the Peach Bowl had a minimum asking price of $191 and a max asking price of $1,522. The minimum asking price as a Thursday was $131 and the maximum asking price was down to $1,171.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TicketIQ reported that the prices for the Fiesta Bowl had ticked up about 3% for the average price over the last 24 hours, but the prices had dipped nearly 20% since Dec. 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">StubHub had seats for sale for the Fiesta Bowl as low as $25 on Thursday with the cheapest seat for the Peach Bowl going for $96.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This year, the two bowls are nearly neck and neck in terms of demand," StubHub spokesman Cameron Papp said in an email to USA TODAY Sports. "We have had more orders for the Fiesta Bowl, but sales have been slightly higher for the Peach Bowl due to the higher price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's interesting that we're not seeing significant sales from each school's region for the Peach Bowl which is probably due to location - at least for Washington. Alabama fans might already be looking forward. For theFiesta, we're seeing Ohio fans willing to travel. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both semifinal games, however, appear to be more demand than last year's semis. Tickets went for as low as $6 via StubHub at the Orange Bowl, one of the two semifinal games a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the national championship game in Tampa on Jan. 9 also stands to be a more expensive ticket than a year ago, although there's still plenty of inventory and prices typically drop as the game approaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national title game has an average listing price of $1,937, according to TicketIQ. Last year, the average sale price for the championship game between Alabama and Clemson went for $610 with the cheapest ticket available of $202.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week brings some illuminating data as the country heads into 2017 on the mood of consumers and the state of the housing market. Both recently hit post-recession milestones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A closely watched index of consumer confidence surged to 107.1 in November, the highest level since July 2007, five months before the Great Recession began. Americans are enjoying solid job and income growth, still-cheap gas despite a recent uptick, and record stock and home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the November survey, most consumers responded before the election. At the least, Donald Trump's win did nothing to ding optimism despite pre-election fears. And the stunning post-election stock market rally stoked by soaring business confidence has further lifted spirits. The <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>'s consumer sentiment index reached a 12-year high in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists estimate the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> on Tuesday will report that its confidence index, which can foretell future spending, also remained in rarefied territory this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason consumers are content is record home prices. In September, the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller national home price index exceeded its pre-recession high, marking a symbolic recovery from the housing crash. But the aggregate numbers don't tell the whole story. After accounting for inflation, home prices are still about 20% below their peak, Ralph McLaughlin of real estate research firm <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While rising prices have created challenges for homebuyers, whose incomes generally have not kept pace, the trend has been good news for homeowners. Many were burdened by mortgage debts that exceeded their home values. The S&amp;P index for October should show continued advances in housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the rise in home prices has been fueled by limited inventories, which have constrained sales. Still, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported last week existing home sales rose 0.7% in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.6 million, the fastest pace in nearly a decade. Rising mortgage rates, which climbed from 3.47% in late October to 4.3% recently, may have nudged some fence-sitters into buying before rates increase further. But higher borrowing costs eventually may crimp sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtor group's pending home sales index for November, which tracks contract signings and foreshadows closings, is out Wednesday and could reveal if a slowdown is on the way.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices hit a milestone recently. But the numbers don't tell the whole story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller national home price index exceeded its prerecession high, marking a symbolic recovery from the devastating housing crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after accounting for inflation, home prices are still about 20% below their peak, says Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist of housing research firm <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And markets reaching their prerecession peaks based on inflation-adjusted prices are almost exclusively in the West and South, with mostly high-end homes accomplishing the feat. Just seven metro areas -- Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Denver, Nashville, Pittsburgh, Tulsa, Okla. , and San Francisco --have hit prerecession levels for starter, trade-up and premium homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only two markets outside of the West and South have recovered to prerecession highs in any segment -- Pittsburgh and Buffalo. in trade up and premium homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rebound "reflects the nature of the broader economic recovery: job, wage, and population growth has occurred disproportionally in the South and West," McLaughlin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices have created challenges for home buyers, whose incomes generally have not kept pace. But they're good news for homeowners who had mortgage debts that exceeded their home values. The S&amp;P index for October, out Tuesday, should show continued advances in housing prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications increased last week despite higher borrowing costs, putting a halt to two-month slide due to fewer homeowners refinancing their loans, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total mortgage applications increased 2. 5% on a seasonally adjusted basis in the week ending December 16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refinancing jumped 3% after weeks of declines while mortgages for purchases increased 2. 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales edged up 0. 7% in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5. 61 million, highest since February 2007, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have climbed steadily since late October on anticipation of stronger inflation, fueled in part by President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal stimulus proposal. The rising borrowing costs have nudged prospective home buyers into making purchases before rates tick higher. But they have discouraged many Americans from refinancing their loans to reduce monthly costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, average rates for 30-year mortgages with balances of $417,000 or less increased from 4. 28% to 4. 41%, the highest level since May 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates for mortgages with balances higher than $417,000 rose from 4. 29% to 4. 36%, highest since April 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjustable-rate mortgages are taking up a growing share and comprised 6. 5% of the total, highest since early this year.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Silicon Valley's housing crunch may be getting some relief soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billionaire real-estate mogul John Sobrato wants to build 200 micro-apartments for the homeless and low-income families on a 2. 5-acre plot of city-owned land in Santa Clara, Calif. , three miles south of Levi's Stadium, home to the NFL's <span class="companylink">San Francisco 49ers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The billionaire envisions 240- and 160-square-foot units made out of shipping containers large enough to house a kitchenette and bathroom with shower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sobrato declined comment. But during a presentation Dec. 6 to the Santa Clara City Council, which was videotaped, Sobrato said it was "time to turn my attention to creating a very cost-effective solution to housing the homeless and very low-income people. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the project, called Innovation Place, the Sobrato Organization would build and own the dwellings and lease them to Santa Clara County, which would provide homeless services and property management. The facility could open as early as 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for the Santa Clara City Council was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project was first reported by Santa Clara Weekly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sobrato's plan is the second in recent weeks to address a decades-old problem in the backyard of Silicon Valley billionaires. Earlier this month, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> said it was pumping $20 million into a community investment program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 55,588 housing units have been built in the state since 2010 despite the creation of 500,000 jobs in that time, according to the <span class="companylink">California Department of Finance</span> and the <span class="companylink">Metropolitan Transportation Commission</span>, a regional planning organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, it's never been more expensive to live in the San Francisco Bay Area. The median price of a single-family home in San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, the heart of Silicon Valley, has soared $780,000 in 2013 to $950,400 last year, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland are three of the four most-expensive U. S. cities to rent in, according to Zumper's National Rent Report for December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley workers, on average, earn $121,000 a year, compared with $118,000 last year and $108,000 in 2011, according to data compiled by market research PayScale for USA TODAY.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-awaited interest rate hike is history after the Federal Reserve finally pulled the trigger last week for just the second time in a decade. Now, it's on to bigger and better things - like judging if economic reports are strong enough to warrant another rate increase as soon as March. This week brings a batch of data on consumer spending, business investment, housing and the final estimate of economic growth in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales have been healthy, rising a total 6% in September and October. And mortgage applications for home purchases advanced in November as rising mortgage rates coaxed buyers into making a move before borrowing costs increase further. But pending home sales, a gauge of future contracts, edged up just 0. 1% in October, notes Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. Economists estimate the National Association of Realtors will report Wednesday that existing home sales fell 1. 4% last month to a still-solid seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5. 52 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy bounced back in the third quarter after nine listless months, according to the Commerce Department's second estimate, growing 3. 2% at an annual rate, as strong consumer spending more than offset paltry business investment. Commercial construction was revised up recently, suggesting businesses spent a bit more than believed, Alexander says. Economists reckon Commerce will report Thursday that growth last quarter will be revised up to 3. 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending also got off to a good start in the fourth quarter with a 0. 3% increase in October on the heels of a 0. 7% rise the previous month. Last week's retail sales report for November was disappointing, showing sales ticked up just 0. 1%. But spending on services, like medical care and travel, can more than make up for weak traffic in stores or online. Economists figure Commerce will announce that total consumer spending increased a healthy 0. 4% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment has been sluggish the past couple of years, mostly because of the oil downturn and a weak global economy and strong dollar that have hurt U. S. exports. But oil prices have risen this year and the dollar leveled off until a recent rally. Core business capital goods orders excluding aircraft and defense - a proxy for business capital spending - has been choppy but rose 0. 4% in October. The <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span> says orders for autos drove another increase in November. Economists expect Commerce's durable goods report to show core orders increased 0. 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">. New home sales fell 1. 9% in October but signs point to a rebound in November, including the increase in mortgage applications. Economists estimate Commerce will report Friday that new home sales rose 2. 1% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 575,000.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average apartment sale prices in Manhattan soared above $2 million for the first time in 2016, according to a new report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York City borough's exclusive real estate got a little bit more exclusive as the average price of unit dwellings -- defined as condos, apartments or co-ops -- rose from $1. 9 million in 2015 to $2. 2 million, according to real-estate information firm CityRealty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a second straight record for the ritzy real estate market. The median sale price -- which means half of transactions were lower, half were higher -- was $1. 2 million in 2016, up from $1. 1 million in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're looking for affordability -- relatively speaking, of course -- a co-op might be your best option. The average co-op price fell from $1. 4 million to $1. 3 million, although the median price rose from $785,000 to $825,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CityRealty projected that Manhattan real estate transactions would total $25. 8 billion and 11,900 units for the year, up from $24. 6 billion and 12,899 units a year earlier. However, the year's final sales tally may feature fewer sales, year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo prices averaged $1,886 per square foot in 2016, a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Great Recession put a temporary dent in the market, but Manhattan has rebounded sharply. Average prices are up 91% since 2006, according to CityRealty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The borough's richest inhabitants are snapping up extravagant homes. An estimated 300 buyers purchased units for $10 million or more this year, up from 189 in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three condos of more than 8,000 square feet in the 432 Park Avenue building sold for $87. 7 million, $60. 9 million and $59. 1 million, topping the list for the year. Those sales and a few others in the ultra-luxury market largely powered the new price record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 5,200 buyers nabbed units at less than $1 million, down from 6,075 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighborhoods with double-digit percentage increases, in comparison with the rest of the borough, were Midtown East, Greenwich Village, the West Village, and Tribeca.</p>

</div><div class="author">Elizabeth Weise; Elizabeth Weise </div><div>1217 words</div><div>5 December 2016</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Long known as a haven for artists, activists and folks on the fringe, the San Francisco Bay area is now largely unaffordable to the very people who made it such a beacon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring housing prices have sparked even greater consequences farther afield, where unpermitted and sometimes unsafe spaces have become the center of the arts community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oakland fire that killed at least 36 people over the weekend set ablaze a warehouse cluttered with impromptu -- and unlicensed -- artist studios and living spaces, and an open second floor used for concerts and parties. One rickety staircase was the only way down for those fleeing the fire from upstairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Artists fear the vibrant but semi-underground community they built could be destroyed in the wake of the blaze as city officials clamp down on potential violations in the hopes of avoiding another catastrophe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Francisco arts scene many Americans picture long ago moved to Oakland and beyond. North Beach may have been affordable in the 1960s, but the 1990s and the first tech boom ushered in an uptick in the cost of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise of the second tech boom in the past six years prompted warehouse spaces and lofts in San Francisco's formerly industrial areas -- once home to artists -- to rapidly give way to high-end condos and live-work spaces that only start-ups with venture capital funding can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Artists, especially young ones, simply don't have that kind of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People don't always have first and last month's rent and a security deposit, they don't make enough money for that. Say rent is two grand. That's six grand to move in -- that's a lot of money for an artist or a young person," said Rusty Blazenhoff, who's long been involved in the larger arts scene, including Burning Man.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate prices in the San Francisco Bay area have gone through the roof in recent years. That's partly the result of an influx of high-paid tech workers and also a dearth in new home construction due to resistance from local communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area gained 500,000 new jobs but only added a little under 56,000 units of housing in the past six years, according to the <span class="companylink">California Department of Finance</span> and the <span class="companylink">Metropolitan Transportation Commission</span>, a regional planning organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco in 2016 was $3,373, according to Rent Jungle. In Oakland, the average for a one-bedroom was $2,778. In comparison, the average rent in New York City was $2,826,according to the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blazenhoff has seen many friends deal with substandard living spaces because there was nothing else available they could afford. "Tech has really changed the scene, but not everyone can work in tech," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some friends who live near the Oakland warehouse that caught fire have dealt with problems such as sewage backing up into their living space and major structural issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They don't want to complain because they don't have anywhere to go. It becomes a question of staying put or facing homelessness. It's kind of ridiculous," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oakland's downtown area was once inexpensive but it, too, has become popular with tech companies and consequently seen rent prices rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, there are artists workspaces and collectives in Oakland's Fruitvale and Jingletown neighborhoods, but even those have become too expensive for many.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm hearing a lot of artists (are) moving to San Leandro, because it was cheaper -- for about five minutes," said Blazenhoff, referring to the working class town eight miles southeast of Oakland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blazenhoff and many others note artists create spaces that draw others, often beginning a process of gentrification that in the end pushes them out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Artists bring culture. They come here to find their people, to find their community," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making spaces</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one chooses to live or attend events in potentially hazardous spaces simply because they're inexpensive, many in the artists' community say. But the low cost also makes them accessible and malleable in way that more mainstream venues never can be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">p. p1 {margin: 0. 0px 0. 0px 0. 0px 0. 0px; font: 16. 0px Georgia; color: #232323; -webkit-text-stroke: #232323} span. s1 {font-kerning: none}</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Friday night's blaze, the 10,000-square-foot building in Oakland housed an artist's collective known as Satya Yuga and a living space known as Ghost Ship, where revelers enjoyed an electronic music party before the fire broke out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These types of spaces are not about making a buck, they're about creating an "ambience and environment that you can tell isn't corporatized," said Vikram Babu, 35, an Oakland app designer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attraction for many who are part of the larger creative community is that these underground venues are accessible, with minimal cover charges. They also let people bring their own alcohol, keeping the cost of going out much lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you go to see these bands at a 'real' venue, there's often a hefty door charge and $12 drinks," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few people seem to understand the links between unaffordable housing, a lack of good-paying jobs for working people and the creative drive that pushes artists to find less-than-ideal solutions, said Babu, who has both lived in and organized independent venues for housing and performances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are real, intractable problems that sprinklers aren't going to solve," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zoning, not costs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others say zoning, not the influx of tech companies, is the real culprit. Artists need space where they can make art -- where they can weld, etch with acid, construct and generally not worry about the carpets or the neighbors when they use power tools in the middle of the night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why they have long been drawn to warehouses and other large, industrial spaces where they could work in peace with the light and space they need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a barrier to moving the properties from one use to another. There's not a fluidity between zoning and permitting. So it's years and years and hundreds of thousands of dollars you have to spend," said Cheryl Edison, a strategist working with The Gate 510, a large mixed-use space in San Leandro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gate 510 began life as a Dodge Plymouth plant in the 1940s, became a mall in the 1970s and then shuttered. Today, it houses a <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and brewery on the ground floor and space for artists, tech companies and makers above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The truth is . . . these buildings are out there. But we need to re-engineer our system so that they can be shifted to different uses, so developers can know how much it will cost to transform these spaces," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are dying malls and derelict manufacturing spaces across the country, but without clear and reasonable zoning transition programs, there's no way for them to become the vibrant creative spaces Edison feels they could and should be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We make a proposal and the fire marshal says 'No' and walks away. That's the system that's currently in place," she said.</p>

<div>481 words</div><div>1 December 2016</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FIRST</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2016 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With mortgage rates ticking up as investors anticipate the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> raising interest rates in December, the cost of borrowing is increasing, and that's leading some new-home buyers to speed up their purchases while discouraging homeowners from refinancing existing mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While mortgage applications for home purchases were essentially flat during the week ended Nov. 25 from the week earlier, refinancings dropped 16%. That meant overall applications fell 9.4%, according to <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> figures released Wednesday and adjusted to accommodate for the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MBA chief economist Mike Fratantoni projected mortgage originations would fall in 2017 due to a sharp drop in refinancing. But he said in an email new-purchase mortgages would increase about 10% in 2017 "based on the strengthening economy, employment and housing demand. The housing market will continue to do well so long as the job market remains strong, and we anticipate a further drop in the unemployment rate in 2017."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average interest rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages hit levels not seen since July 2015, according to MBA. Rates for mortgages with balances of $417,000 or less were 4.23%, while rates for mortgages with balances of more than $417,000 were 4.18%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With mortgage rates going up, affordability is down," said David Berson, former chief economist of Fannie Mae and current chief economist at Nationwide Insurance, in an interview. But "affordability is still at a fairly high level."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dave Liniger, CEO of brokerage franchisor RE/MAX agreed higher rates shouldn't harm the housing market "at all. In fact," he said in an email, "a rising interest- and mortgage-rate environment could actually cause an uptick in demand, with savvy buyers wanting to get into homes and lock in their rates more quickly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some indications homebuyers might be taking a breather as rate increases accelerate. New-home searches on real estate site <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span> have "essentially been flat for the last month," Zillow senior economist Aaron Terrazas said in an interview. Still, Terrazas said big life decisions and local housing inventory are bigger factors than interest rates for homebuyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgages issued to purchase homes, rather than refinancing existing mortgages, are still humming along at an encouraging clip. Some "fence sitters" are buying now to avoid higher rates later, Berson said. What's more, the strong housing market and wage increases are encouraging many buyers to take the plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, higher prices are crowding out some homebuyers. The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices reported Tuesday that home prices hit an all-time high in September, rising 5.5% from a year earlier and 0.4% from August. Prices averaged $184,800 in September, surpassing July 2006's peak of $184,620.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices have recovered from their plunge during the housing bust and Great Recession.

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">To buy home tomorrow, Millennials should do this today</span>
</div><div class="author">Alyssa Oursler; Alyssa Oursler </div><div>547 words</div><div>24 November 2016</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no secret that Millennials are putting off buying homes. Only 35% of those under 35 currently own, according to the Census Bureau. The biggest reason is also the most obvious: saving up for the down payment, closing costs and all their other expenses takes time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means for many, their first-home milestone is still several years away. However, in the meantime, there are many steps Millennials can and should be taking right now to prepare for their big moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To save money on contractors once they become homeowners, Millennials should start learning basic home-repair skills now, years before ever setting foot in their new abode. And budgeting for the costs to maintain a home, not to mention the monthly mortgage, should also begin years in advance, according to Ryan Brown, a partner at wealth management firm CR Myers &amp; Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While it may be difficult to know for sure what you will be making in three to five years, imagine a number you think you will be making and then work backwards," he suggested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides saving, Millennials need to be very careful about how they're spending. "An oft-overlooked piece of the financing puzzle is the debt-to-income ratio," real estate agent Deb Tomaro said. "Today's Millennials often have tons of student loan debt on top of consumer debt. " Because minimizing the debt load is crucial, leasing a car or enrolling in graduate school, for instance, could represent unintended additional hurdles on the path to homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, merely recognizing hurdles as such is the first step for preparing to buy a home. Consider, for example, NewDay USA, a mortgage lender. A recent survey of its employees found that 60% of employees who have worked at the company for at least three years purchased a home during that time -- a trend Lauren Holzer, vice president of HR, attributes quite simply to their increased exposure to the lending and buying process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, not all forms of homeownership education are created equal; Tomaro's advice also included: "Turn off the HGTV! Those home improvement projects take more than 30 minutes!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennials: Think Like a Real Estate Investor</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your first home might not be your dream home, but it can still be an investment toward it. That's why John Matthews of real estate investment firm PCI says Millennials should think like investors and begin studying the market that they may want to buy in now. The following line of questioning can help you think like an investor:What makes the town, city or county you want to live in a good place for rising home values? Is there a large Fortune 500 company moving in, or an Amazon distribution center? Are more businesses moving in than out?What types of building are increasing or decreasing in demand in the area? Are single-family homes, condos, or multifamily in highest demand, and how does that align with your property goals?What do the county and state's balance sheets look like? If you live in a state that is nearly bankrupt, such as Illinois, you can expect to pay a lot higher taxes every year you own the house.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing homes sold at the fastest pace in nearly 10 years last month despite persistently skimpy supplies as faster wage gains and low mortgage rates motivated buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased 2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5. 6 million from an upwardly revised 5. 49 million in September, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. That's the highest level since February 2007 and soundly beat the estimate of a 0. 7% rise by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"October's strong sales gain was widespread throughout the country and can be attributed to the release of the unrealized pent-up demand that held back many would-be buyers over the summer because of tight supply," said Lawrence Yun, the realtor group's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing inventories were paltry again in October, declining to a 4. 3-month supply from 4. 4 months September. A six-month inventory is considered balanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Yun said, "The good news is that the tightening labor market is beginning to push up wages and the economy has lately shown signs of greater expansion. These two factors and low mortgage rates have kept buyer interest at an elevated level so far this fall. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet citing the limited stock of homes, Trulia Chief Economist Ralph McLaughlin said, "The housing market still faces headwinds toward a full recovery. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average wages increased 2. 8% annually in October, the most in seven years. And 30-year mortgage rates averaged 3. 94% last week, up from 3. 57% the previous week as President-elect Donald Trump's proposed stimulus drives expectations of accelerating inflation. But mortgages remain cheap by historical standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts reached a postrecession high in October, a development that, if it continues, "could go a long way in giving homeowners much-needed assurance that they can list their home for sale and find a new home to buy within a reasonable timeframe," Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, single-family home sales increased 2. 3% while condominium and co-op sales were unchanged. The median sales price of all homes was $232,200, up 6% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up 2. 8% in the South, 2. 3% in the Midwest, 1. 4% of the Northeast and 0. 8% in the West</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short of getting a certified pledge from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, investors don't really need any more signals about the Fed's interest rate plans next month. It's almost certainly hiking rates for the first time this year. But minutes of the Fed's Nov. 2 meeting could hammer home the message and perhaps provide some clues on what could possibly derail a rate increase. This week's economic news also features reports on home sales and business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales have been on a bit of a roller coaster lately, rising in September after falling the previous two months. Demand isn't the issue. Americans are enjoying healthy job and income growth, cheap gasoline and reduced debt. And at least some Millennials are growing weary of living in their parents' basements. The problem: There aren't enough homes for sale. Inventories edged up in September but are still 6. 8% below year-ago levels, according to real estate research firm <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. And while pending home sales, a gauge of future contracts, rose in September, mortgage applications for home purchases fell sharply last month, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. Economists estimate the National Association of Realtors will announce Tuesday that existing-home sales dipped 0. 6% in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5. 4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales, which make up about 10% of all sales, have followed a roughly similar pattern, rising in September after sliding the previous month. In October, builder sentiment on single-family sales was strong, but the drop in mortgage applications is worrisome, Alexander says. Economists forecast the Commerce Department will report Wednesday that new-home sales slipped 0. 5% in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 590,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment, meanwhile, picked up a bit in the third quarter but generally has been anemic this year. Global economic troubles and a strong dollar have hurt U. S. exports, while the oil industry slump has dampened steel and equipment orders. Rising oil prices and a moderating greenback have helped stanch the bleeding, but demand has been choppy. And uncertainty about tax and regulatory policies leading up to the election probably caused some businesses to rein in spending. Orders for capital goods excluding aircraft and defense -- a proxy for business investment -- fell 1. 2% in September. Economists reckon Commerce's durable goods report will show that measure rose 0. 3% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a congressional hearing last week, Yellen reiterated signals that a rate increase is likely next month. She also indicated that the surprise victory of Donald Trump in the presidential race has not thrown the Fed off course. But minutes of the Nov. 2 meeting could reveal if policymakers were concerned about the upcoming vote and if other shocks could prompt a delay.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short of getting a certified pledge from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, investors don't really need any more signals about the Fed's interest rate plans next month. It's almost certainly hiking rates for the first time this year. But minutes of the Fed's Nov. 2 meeting could hammer home the message. This week's economic news also features reports on home sales and business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales have been on a bit of a roller coaster lately, rising in September after falling the previous two months. Demand isn't the issue. Americans are enjoying healthy job and income growth, cheap gasoline and reduced debt. And at least some Millennials are growing weary of living in their parents' basements. The problem: There aren't enough homes for sale. Inventories are still 6.8% below year-ago levels, according to real estate research firm <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. And while pending home sales, a gauge of future contracts, rose in September, mortgage applications fell sharply last month, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. Economists estimate the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> will announce Tuesday that existing-home sales dipped 0.6% in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales have followed a roughly similar pattern. In October, builder sentiment on single-family sales was strong, but the drop in mortgage applications is worrisome. Economists forecast the Commerce Department will report Wednesday that new-home sales slipped 0.5% in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 590,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts jumped 25% in October to a postrecession high as volatile apartment construction more than reversed a sharp decline and single-family starts surged as well. .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of homes and apartments rose 25. 5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1. 3 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That soundly beat economists' estimate of 1. 16 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily starts soared 69% to an annual rate of 454,000 after falling 38% in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family starts increased 10. 7% to an annual rate of 869,000, which also marked a postrecession high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, an indicator of future starts, edged up to an annual rate of 1. 23 million,more than the 1. 19 million economists expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's data reaffirm our view that steady improvement in the housing market is likely to continue over the next two years," Barclays economist Rob Martin wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving the advances are solid job and income gains, especially among Millennials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With improved employment and income prospects, Millennials are an expanding portion of housing demand as they move out of their parents homes -- increasingly to form families," says Nationwide Chief Economist David Berson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northeast and Midwest region's lead, with gains of 44. 8% and 44. 1%, respectively. Starts increased 23. 2% in the West and 17. 9% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the strong performance, housing starts are still only about 66% of their 50 or average, says Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist of real estate research firm Trulia.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testifies before Congress this week on the economy in a hearing that should clarify whether the Fed remains on track to hike interest rates next month after Donald Trump's win in the presidential race. Meanwhile, reports on retail sales, inflation, industrial production and housing starts will provide the Fed a window onto the economy that could help determine whether it acts at a mid-December meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales surged in September on rising gasoline prices and stronger auto purchases, but a core measure that strips out such volatile categories edged up just slightly after two straight declines. Consumers, however, are generally on solid footing after this year's steady job growth and solid wage gains, which accelerated in October. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Tuesday to report that retail sales jumped another 0. 6% last month while a core reading bounced back, advancing a healthy 0. 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Fed turns toward a creaky gear in the economy's engine -- industrial production. Since 2014, manufacturers have grappled with the oil sector downturn and weak exports. With oil prices rising and the dollar stabilizing in 2016, factory output has recovered somewhat but remains choppy. Economists expect the Fed's October report to show a modest 0. 2% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yellen's appearance before the Joint Economic Committee on Thursday offers her the first chance to weigh in on any economic fallout from Trump's election. In response to his claims during the campaign that Yellen was keeping interest rates low to help President Obama, she simply said the Fed is unaffected by politics. Some economists believe Trump's win has intensified uncertainty about trade, immigration and other issues that could prompt businesses to curb hiring and investment. But markets have rallied since the vote, and many economists say the Fed is still likely to hike its key rate next month for the first time in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A further pickup in inflation could help solidify a December rate increase. Meager inflation has been a big reason the Fed has been on hold, but prices climbed more rapidly in recent months. Nomura economist Lewis Alexander says rising gasoline prices probably pushed up overall inflation substantially in October. A core measure that excludes food and energy is expected to increase modestly as higher medical costs offset softness in airline fares and hotel rates, Alexander says. Economists expect the Labor Department to announce an increase in annual inflation to 1. 6% in October and an unchanged 2. 2% core reading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts have increased steadily this year but tumbled in September on a 38% plunge in volatile apartment starts, which had picked up strongly in previous months. Economists expect Commerce to report a rebound in October, with starts rising 10. 8%.</p>
