<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in July plunged to the lowest level in 15 years, deepening worries that the housing market's tenuous recovery is threatened by buyers' shaky confidence in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic forecasts were plenty pessimistic ahead of Tuesday's report by the National Association of Realtors because of other data pointing to weakening sales since the federal tax credit ended in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actual numbers were far worse -- sales fell more than 27% from June and 25% from a year ago to an annual rate of 3.83 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have averaged 5.2 million for the past three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is not clear if the housing market hit a huge air pocket or crashed and burned, but for now, this sector looks to be flat on its back," says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stunning drop-off when mortgage rates are at historic lows indicates many potential buyers have lost confidence, Naroff says. "If no one is confident, I don't know that the interest rates matter, no one is going to want to borrow," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say Tuesday's report also indicates that the housing recovery has faltered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This qualifies as a double dip in housing," says Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, adding buyer confidence has also been shaken by a weakening stock market and a lack of jobs. "These are pretty ugly numbers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No region of the country was spared: Existing-home sales fell 35% in the Midwest, 30% in the Northeast, 25% in the West and 23% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright spot was prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median home price rose to $182,600, up 0.7% compared with July 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed sales represented 32% of all sales, about the same as in June and a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are being stymied by tight lending standards and a large number of homeowners who lack equity in their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even if they had the confidence to buy, that might not do any good because they might not be able to get credit or they might be underwater on the home they've got," says Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another read on the housing market comes today when the government reports new-home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists predict housing sales will show some improvement this fall but will remain weak until unemployment -- 9.5% in July -- comes down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People really aren't looking," says Ellen Assael, a Realtor at ZipRealty in Westchester, N.Y. "It's a really very stagnant market right now. People are still nervous."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bangor, Maine, is in the far northeast of the United States, close to Canada. But that has not isolated it from the national housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We certainly had a boom, and we had a bust," says Earl Black, president of Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Town &amp;Country. "But Bangor doesn't experience the real highs nor does it experience the real lows."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bangor's location has kept the local housing market fairly stable. As the county seat of Penobscot County, the city has a strong local economy and an airport. It is also close to Acadia National Park on the rugged coast, an attraction for vacation home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Home sales are rising. Despite national economic woes, people in Bangor who have jobs are more willing to invest in homes. "People are OK," Black says. "I would not say comfortable, but they are getting used to all of the negative financial talk and are making a decision to move on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of vacation homes slowed after the economy crashed. But Realtors are selling more waterfront property this year, Black says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Bangor and Penobscot County home sales were 3.1% higher than in June 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Local savings banks are strong in the area, and they did not get caught up in subprime lending, Black says. That kept home foreclosures from being worse than they might have been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales of foreclosed homes have increased, and that's led to a dip in home prices. The now-expired tax credit brought more first- time home buyers into the market, helping lower the median price of homes that sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, the median sales price -- $130,000 -- was 10.3% lower than in June 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Bangor had an unemployment rate of 7.5% in June, less than the national rate of 9.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its unemployment is slightly below Maine's because it is the economic hub of the northern part of the state, says James McConnon, professor of economics at the University of Maine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bangor-area economy depends mostly on the service sector. It has two major hospitals and is about 10 miles from the University of Maine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tourists fly into Bangor to see the city and then drive to Acadia National Park. And many people who live in rural areas go to Bangor to shop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. The downtown and waterfront areas have been rejuvenated in recent years, says Rosanne Bates, president of the Greater Bangor Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One attraction is this weekend. The American Folk Festival on the waterfront, held each year at the end of August, runs Friday through Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quaint downtown area has many small parks, a farmers' market and an outdoor theater, Bates says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are not many homes in the downtown area, but there are neighborhoods surrounding it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Queen Anne Victorian home with original woodwork that is within walking distance of downtown is $169,900.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Grand Isle, La., this is typically a busy season for Realtor Beverly Curole. Interested buyers come to check out the available properties in this barrier island known for its July fishing rodeo, sandy beaches and vacation homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since the Gulf oil spill sent a sheen of oil into the island's bay, Curole's buyers have fled. First, they put closings on hold. Then they canceled contracts. Now she's hoping to get some money from BP for lost commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The beach is now clean, she says, but sales are still suffering. "The buyers aren't there," she says. "I'm a sales agent, and there's nothing to sell. Hopefully, now that it's capped, it'll be better, but we don't know how long it's going to last."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In coastal areas of Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, the spill has whacked housing prices. Some residential and commercial development deals have fallen apart, and Realtors and brokers have watched demand falter as some buyers balk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the 4.9 million barrels of oil that gushed from the well have been contained, with about 26% dispersed into the waters, scientists at the Interior Department and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waters most affected by the BP oil spill are largely between Louisiana state waters at the mouth of the Mississippi River and waters off Florida's Pensacola Bay, according to the White House. There's virtually no remaining threat to the Florida Keys or the East Coast, the government has said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fears sink sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But fears persist that property values could drop even in areas where the oil has not been spotted, and concern that tar balls could wash up has been enough to sink some sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Studies on the effect of the Gulf oil spill on housing in the area show:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*The impact of the spill on home values in communities already affected by the spill is expected to range from $648 million over one year to as much as $3 billion over five years, according to an Aug. 2 report by <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. Of the immediately affected areas, the largest overall loss in value would be in Pensacola ($1.6 billion), followed by Gulfport, Miss. ($1.2 billion).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The guy who is renting is going to see an immediate loss," says Mark Fleming, chief economist at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. "If I've lost this value, do I have some right to compensation?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Housing prices are likely to fall 10% in total along the 569- mile coastline, where there are about 14,396 acres affected by the spill, according to CoStar Group, a commercial real estate analysis firm in Bethesda, Md. Assuming that the developed beachfront property has a present value of $3 million an acre and the value drops 10%, that would come to $4.32 billion of land value lost because of the spill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Florida, the state is the least able to bounce back from another real estate setback. Some coastal areas in Florida are being affected by the spill. According to a Fitch Ratings report, Florida already ranks the worst among all states in mortgage delinquencies across all product types. Further economic stress brought on by the oil spill and declines in the tourism and fishing industries are likely to increase default rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Florida has been devastated by foreclosure. Texas and Louisiana have had Katrina devastation," says Tara-Nicholle Nelson, real estate consumer advocate at website Trulia. "They've been hit time and time again. This is having an immediate, devastating impact on agents. Phones are ringing, but it's mostly people wanting to sell. I'd be amazed if some of them don't come back with claims against BP."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five Realtor associations in the Gulf states -- Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Texas -- have formed a coalition to work on common issues related to the oil spill, including providing financial assistance to real estate brokers and agents in the area whose business has suffered. "I know sales have slowed, and some that had been pending have fallen through the cracks," says Malcolm Young of the Louisiana Realtors Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BP says it is honoring compensation claims and expediting the process of getting payments of some claims to small businesses. Among the types of claims being considered are payments to owners on beaches that have been closed because of oil to compensate for lost rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BP has paid out $376 million to individuals and businesses since making its first payment on May 3. BP spokesman Robert Wine says whether to pay claims for declines in property values is a gray area that will be decided later by the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, which will take over processing of claims from businesses and individuals on Aug. 23. The GCCF will be run by lawyer Kenneth Feinberg, who oversaw the 9/11 victims compensation fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawsuit filed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers are taking action. <span class="companylink">The St. Joe Co</span>., one of Florida's largest real estate development companies, filed a lawsuit on Aug. 4 against <span class="companylink">Halliburton Energy Services</span>, the cementing contractor for the well that blew out. St. Joe owns about 577,000 acres in Florida, 70% of which are within 15 miles of the coast of the Gulf. The company's stock price declined by more than 40% in the days following the explosion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elliot Bellen, CEO of New Bastion Development, has spent four years buying land and planning residential and commercial development projects in Panama City Beach and Marianna, Fla., including a golf course and senior housing. That's on the Florida Panhandle, where some oil did wash ashore, so those plans are on hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm has hired a law firm and is planning legal action. "Who is going to pony up their hard-earned money when they don't know if there's going to be a plume of oil or tar ball? It's having a serious effect on raising capital. We've gone four years without revenue, and we have a duty to our shareholders," Bellen says. "We're entitled to some sort of damages."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Construction loans get hammered ; They've become the worst bet in real estate, and the losses just keep growing</span>
</div><div class="author">Paul Wiseman </div><div>1578 words</div><div>17 August 2010</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest bank killer around isn't some exotic derivative investment concocted by Wall Street's financial alchemists. It's the plain old construction loan, Main Street banks' bread and butter for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> has called them "without doubt, the riskiest commercial real estate loan product." The Congressional Oversight Panel, a financial watchdog, has warned that construction loans have deteriorated faster and inflicted bigger losses on banks than any other real estate loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the worst may be yet to come. Banks, adopting a desperation strategy known as "extend and pretend" or "delay and pray," have been reluctant to admit defeat, repossess half-completed housing developments and strip malls -- and dump them on a depressed market at a big loss. "There probably are many loans out there that are in worse shape than reflected on lenders' books," says Chicago construction lawyer Joshua Glazov.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the numbers are already grim:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Across the banking system, nearly 17% of construction loans were non-current -- at least 90 days past due or otherwise in trouble -- at the end of March, a record level and a stark contrast to less than 5.5% for all loans, according to the latest numbers available from the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. For construction loans on one- to four-family residences, the percentage of bad loans is even worse: nearly 23%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Construction loans are experiencing the biggest problems with vacancy or cash-flow issues, have the highest likelihood of default, and have higher loss severity rates than other commercial real estate loans," the Congressional Oversight Panel, tasked with overseeing the federal bailout fund, reported earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*The 10% of banks that had the highest concentration of construction loans at the end of 2007 account for more than half of the 274 banks that have failed between then and Aug. 6, according to an analysis for USA TODAY by SNL Financial in Charlottesville, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Even the banks that have survived despite holding high concentrations of construction loans remain vulnerable. Their average "Texas ratio" -- which measures their bad loans as a percentage of their capital and reserves against loan losses -- stood at 101% on June 30, up from 90% three months earlier, SNL found. Anything over 100% signals that a bank is in danger of failing. For construction-loan-heavy banks, the median Texas ratio - - which weeds out the worst cases -- was still high, at 62%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been a bloodbath out here," says bank consultant Tod Little of BNK Advisors in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers typically take out short-term, adjustable-rate loans to buy and develop property. The bank releases money in increments - - as the developer needs it -- and puts some of the proceeds in a reserve from which the builder makes interest payments before the project starts generating revenue. After the project is completed -- and tenants have moved in and started paying rent -- the developer takes out a longer-term mortgage to pay off the construction loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Cocaine' for banks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many small and midsize banks, eager for growth, grew addicted to construction loans during the housing boom. "Construction lending is really the cocaine of the banking industry," says veteran banker Rollo Ingram. "They're easy to do. They're big-dollar loans that can bulk up a balance sheet. And there are always developers who want loans."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction loans -- officially labeled "acquisition, development and construction" loans -- surged more than 150% between the first quarters of 2003 and 2008, when they peaked at $631.8 billion. (Overall loans rose just 55% during the same period.) If a bank said no to a construction loan, "The developer could just go down the street," says Brandon, Fla., bank consultant Jon Campbell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some of the people getting loans during the real estate frenzy of the mid-2000s were amateurs, says Boston bank consultant David Brown: "They were contractors who got the bug and felt they could make a living at being a developer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It did not end well. Construction loans started blowing up when the real estate market collapsed and the economy tumbled into recession. The 10 biggest banks, facing problems of their own with subprime mortgages, were largely immune to the deterioration in construction loans, which accounted for just 2% of their assets in 2007, according to the Federal Reserve. By contrast, construction loans accounted for more than 10% of assets at banks that didn't rank in the top 1,000. "What's causing the problem is Main Street America, the construction loan made by the bank down the street," says Bill Bartmann, who owns a debt advisory firm. "They built, and nobody came."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making matters worse: Community banks never sold the construction loans to investors the way banks unload auto loans and residential mortgages. "Most construction loans are so unique, so different, so non-homogenous, that you can't securitize them," Bartmann says. "They were kept on the books of the banks that originated them." And there, many of them started to turn rotten.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A failure's postmortem</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rollo Ingram witnessed one spectacular flameout up close. He was chief financial officer at Atlanta's RockBridge Commercial Bank, which opened in 2006, backed by other members of the city's business elite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RockBridge told banking regulators it planned to specialize in business lending. It didn't, plunging instead into real estate and construction loans. The bank told regulators in 2006 that construction loans would account for 5% of its portfolio. By the end of 2007, they accounted for 42%. Business loans, which were supposed to make up 50% of RockBridge's lending, came to just 28%, according to an after-the-fact autopsy by <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>.'s inspector general.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor did RockBridge recruit veteran loan officers with enough experience to safely assemble its risky portfolio, the inspector general concluded. "They hired younger, less-experienced ones, and didn't hire enough of them," Ingram says. He says he was forced out in 2008 when he complained about the risky direction the bank was taking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time RockBridge failed last December, more than 60% of its construction loans had gone sour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other banks on SNL Financial's list of failed construction- focused banks fared even worse: At Chicago's Ravenswood Bank, more than 69% of construction loans went bad before regulators pulled the plug Aug. 6. By the time Wheatland Bank in Naperville, Ill., failed in April, more than 80% of its construction loans had gone belly- up. <span class="companylink">Security Bank of Gwinnett County</span>, Ga., failed a year ago with three-quarters of its construction loans underwater. Georgia saw more construction-focused bank failures (34) than any other state between the end of 2007 and August, according to SNL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brown of RMPI Consulting in Boston blames the banks themselves. He says many banks, trying to cut costs and boost profits, dropped training programs that would have taught loan officers how to assess risks on construction projects and other loans: "I could see it coming for five years," he says. "Banks got sloppy; banks got greedy; banks got lazy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Little says many construction loans were prudent when banks made them. Some banks demanded that developers make 50% down payments only to see the value of the projects drop 80%: "That's really killing the community banks."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says regulators are unreasonably forcing banks to take losses on real estate loans and pushing them out of business when they would rebound if given enough time to work with borrowers and await a recovery in real estate. "They're bayoneting the wounded," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, a council of federal bank regulators issued a statement last October encouraging banks to work with commercial real estate borrowers struggling with empty office space and storefronts, evaporating rental income and collapsing property prices. "Prudent loan workouts are often in the best interest of both financial institutions and borrowers, particularly during difficult economic conditions," the council said, adding that regulators wouldn't force banks to write down otherwise good loans "solely because the value of the underlying collateral declined."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The regulators have probably held back in places," lawyer Glazov says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Troubled construction projects are a nightmare for banks. "If a bank forecloses on a house, it's a house. Everybody knows what to do with it," Bartmann says. "But if you're dealing with a half- constructed hotel or a half-constructed strip mall, not only does no one want it, you now have to maintain it" -- trim the hedges, pay the property taxes, write checks to the power company. So, many bankers have chosen to wait it out, extending the terms of loans to troubled developers to keep from having to foreclose and take possession of a half-built headache. Which leaves bad loans and troubled property in limbo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The loans aren't coming to market," says Sam Chandan, president of Real Estate Econometrics in New York. "The distress is sitting on bank balance sheets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concludes Wayne Heicklen, co-chair of the real estate practice at the New York law firm Pryor Cashman: "They're hoping the existing borrowers or someone else will come along and put more money in the project and make it right."</p>

</div><div class="author">Christine Dugas </div><div>514 words</div><div>17 August 2010</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.7</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A heat wave has hit Bowling Green, Ky., this summer but it has not held back home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summer is usually the slowest time of the year for the local housing market. But even though this has been one of the hottest summers in years, it also has been the busiest part of the year so far for home sales, says Ruth Ann Bowen, president of the Realtor Association of Southern Kentucky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bowling Green is not like other areas of the country that saw a surge in sales while the home buyer tax credit was in effect and a drop after it ended in April. The tax credit "did not make a big difference" either way, Bowen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In June, home sales in the Bowling Green area were 10.9% higher than in June 2009. With businesses expanding in the Bowling Green area, that's bolstered buyers' confidence in the economy and encouraged them to buy now when interest rates are low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Even though sales are rising, Bowling Green has a larger-than-normal inventory of homes for sale. As homes stay on the market longer, some sellers are cutting their prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are seeing more of that in the last month or so," Bowen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price was $123,500 in June, 4% lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Manufacturing is a major part of the economy in Bowling Green. It is the headquarters of <span class="companylink">Fruit of the Loom</span>, which recently added about 600 jobs. And it has a General Motors Corvette assembly plant. GM canceled its traditional summer shutdown this year to meet demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Overall, Bowling Green is more resilient than the state of Kentucky," says Uric Dufrene, a regional economist at Indiana University Southeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Bowling Green's downtown, which has an historic area, has gone through many changes in recent years. Circus Square Park, opened in 2008, hosts picnics and concerts. And there's a new downtown ballpark for the local minor league baseball team, the Bowling Green Hot Rods, a farm team for the Tampa Bay Rays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historic homes downtown are priced at about $175,000 to $200,000, Bowen says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fort Myers, Fla., housing market was starting to turn around until it hit a snag this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fort Myers had been one of the nation's first areas hit by the bursting of the housing bubble, and the local real estate industry had hoped it would be among the first to recover. It seemed well on its way in June 2009 when home sales were 121% higher than in June 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 2010, home sales have been dragged down by a number of factors, including the end of the home-buyer tax credit, the temporary lapse of the National Flood Insurance Program and fears that the BP Gulf oil spill would reach the beaches in the Fort Myers area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it is just a hiccup," says Christie Knight, president of Realtor Association of Greater Fort Myers and the Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, the National Flood Insurance Program was renewed, retroactive to June 1 through Sept. 30. And the oil has not washed up on its beaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the oil spill has given tourists and home buyers something to worry about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Fort Myers was struggling to begin with, and now the timing of the oil spill is most unfortunate," says Sean Snaith, economics professor at the University of Central Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In June, the metro area's home sales were 18% lower than in June 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local market has relied on international buyers and vacation home buyers, many of whom have been paying in cash. In the first quarter, 71% of home purchases were made with cash, Knight says. But in the second quarter that dropped to a little over 65%, perhaps because many second-home buyers held back to see what damage came from the oil spill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Prices have come way down since the peak in 2005. Then, a waterfront home might have cost $800,000 and now goes for $300,000 or $350,000, Knight says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years ago, most families who lived and worked in the area couldn't afford to buy a home. "The market was very influenced by speculators who artificially increased the prices," Knight says. "Now they are very affordable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are starting to climb back. In June, the median sales price -- $93,000 -- was 12% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cape Coral-Fort Myers still has one of the highest foreclosure rates among large metro areas, according to RealtyTrac. Many low- priced foreclosed homes are getting multiple bids, pushing prices up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. For many years, construction and tourism drove the Fort Myers economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was an example of an area that was being fueled in large part by the housing boom," Snaith says. "It has felt significant pain when the boom went bust. And we haven't seen any signs of job creation taking place."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fort Myers metro area had an unemployment rate of 12.5% in May, higher than the state's rate of 11.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, most foreclosures were properties purchased by speculators, but now unemployment is sending more owner-occupied homes into foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. The McGregor Boulevard area of Fort Myers is eclectic and desirable. It may be pricier than other parts of town, but its prices are much more affordable than they were a few years ago, Knight says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some old Spanish-style villas, Florida "Cracker" style homes and newer Mediterranean homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McGregor-Riverside, for example, is a historic neighborhood where prices range from $99,000 to several million dollars.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emily Rennie's three-bedroom house in Oakland was a beauty in a sweet location. Walking distance to the lakeshore. Close to shops. A refurbished patio in the back. Inside, a modern kitchen with granite countertops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listed at $539,000 when she put it on the market, the Excelsior Avenue house was missing one crucial thing: The right price. After a few weeks with no offers, she cut the price to $499,000 in May. Then she cut it to $475,000 in June. She is still hoping for an offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rennie is discovering the cold reality of post-housing-bust prices: No matter what she thinks her house is worth, what matters is what buyers are willing to pay. That can be a lot less in areas where the supply of houses for sale is swollen by foreclosures and short sales, often priced 20% to 30% below the ones being sold by financially healthy owners. Nationally, such properties account for a third of all sales three years after a historic chill blew over an overheated housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures "do make it harder to sell," acknowledges Rennie, who works in marketing communications. "People can get a really good deal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate professionals say Rennie is in good company. Nationally, 30% of the houses for sale were reduced in price in June, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, an online real estate site. Plenty of sellers have trouble pricing their home against the foreclosed houses that lenders are trying to unload.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's one of the hardest things for sellers to do. They have an emotional attachment to their house," says Amy Bohutinsky, a spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>. "For sellers to understand how they should price, they should deeply understand their market and competition -- what's on the market now, not just what's sold."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who do that successfully don't have a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People who price their homes to the market are selling them in a reasonable amount of time, but people who cling to 2004 or 2005 prices aren't," says Richard Smith, president and CEO of <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>, the parent company of Century 21, ERA, Coldwell Banker and <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>. "If you take into account (bank-owned property) pressures, you'll sell pretty quickly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition for bargains</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oakland and nearby San Francisco are two markets where foreclosures have a strong influence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly three of every 1,000 homeowners in Oakland lost their homes to foreclosure in May, according to Zillow. Foreclosure resales made up 36% of all sales in May, although that's down from a peak of 66% in March 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers have had to adjust. In June, 20% of the properties for sale in Oakland made price cuts, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, compared with 15% in May. Drawn by falling prices, young professionals from San Francisco are coming across the bay to snap up homes in Oakland, and most of the stiffest competition for properties is in the top tier, around $808,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that price, sellers in May paid 0.1% less than the asking price, according to Zillow. In all price ranges, they paid 0.3% less than asking price. Based on the median list price, that's $1,080 less than the last listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some agents are seeing bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing multiple offers; we're seeing above asking price," says David Kerr, a ZipRealty agent who represents buyers and sellers in Oakland. "People are buying foreclosures, fixing them up and selling them and getting offers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who do take foreclosures into account and price their homes right cannot only find a buyer, but sometimes one who will pay well above what they're asking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such buyer was Rosa Verdin, 40, who bought a restored Victorian in north Oakland from a developer in May. The asking price was $450,000, which was well-priced, she says. She and her partner, Kelly Helms, 32, a nurse, offered $50,000 more, outbidding at least two other parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had been looking for six to eight months," says Verdin, 40, who works in graphic arts. "The location was centrally located to our work, the house was move-in ready and within our price points. Timing just seemed right, and the decision was relatively easy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all offers go so smoothly. Even when owners find willing buyers, getting their price isn't a sure thing. Lenders generally require appraisals before giving a mortgage, and appraisers often take into account what foreclosed properties in the area sell for when determining how much a home is worth. If a home is being sold at too high a price, the sale can fall apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every day, sales fall apart," says Leslie Sellers, with the Appraisal Institute. "Smart sellers get appraisals done before they sell the home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in markets where most sellers are getting just below asking price, some are taking a long time to find a buyer. Glen Cox put his sprawling, five-bedroom Oakland home with sweeping views of the bay and Golden Gate bridge up for sale at the end of 2008 for $1.8 million. He's selling it without a real estate agent. He took it off the market for a while after he got no offers. Today, he's offering it for $1.695 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house features vaulted ceilings, nine rooms with French doors, travertine balconies and an oak-arbored entry corridor. "There're not many homes in the $1.5 (million) to $1.6 million range, and mine is nicer than most of them," Cox says. "If you don't have the one buyer right away, it can take awhile. It's a very tough market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighborhoods buck trend</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other neighborhoods also show just how well good prices pull in successful offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the heart of San Francisco, Noe Valley is home to dot-com millionaires and working professionals. The streets are lined with Edwardian and grand Victorian row houses built in the late 19th century, and the neighborhood, flanked by hills, features an eclectic array of coffee shops, sushi restaurants and lively bookshops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market in San Francisco is struggling to regain its footing, with home prices down 0.7% from the third quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of this year. But in Noe Valley, most homes are going just above listing price. In May, homes sold for an average of 0.02% more than the last listing price, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>. Based on median list price, that translates into $218 more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's crazy," says Brendon DeSimone, a Realtor with Paragon Real Estate in San Francisco, who represents buyers and sellers in Noe Valley. "I had one house with five offers, and it went from $1.4 million to $1.7 million. The valley has just popped. It's not uncommon for one open house to have 200 people come through."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the average property takes eight to nine weeks to sell, down from 10 to 11 weeks a year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors. In Noe Valley in May, there were 25 listings that sold after averaging five weeks on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Paul McCickard, who put his home on the market in mid-March, is still waiting for a buyer. So far, he's had only one offer. His home, priced at $2.149 million, is a 3,400-square-foot Edwardian with four bedrooms, a two-car garage, marble fireplaces, stream showers and a view of the skyline. He says he had to price it at that amount in part because it was an investment property. He bought in 2005, demolished the home and rebuilt it; he needs to pay back the money he owes on the construction -- and hopes to make a little profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've invested a lot of money into the house, so it's a matter of trying to recoup the money. Hopefully, it will sell," says McCickard, who sells heavy equipment. "There's been a lot of walk- throughs and a few interested parties, but we're still waiting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other homes have found buyers, and fast. Charlie Frisbie lost out on his first offer in Noe Valley, so he bid again last year on a two- bedroom Edwardian with an asking price of $998,000. There were a total of 11 offers; he got it at $1.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're getting the best the city has to offer -- transportation, good weather, access to parks," says Frisbie, 48, an accountant. "Twice this year, homes came for sale on my block, but they didn't even go on the market -- they just sold. Those that do go on the market go substantially over" asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noe Valley has taken a hit as the overall housing market has tumbled, with home values down 17% from their peak in June 2008, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>. In the neighborhood, about 5% of home sales in March were foreclosure resales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Noe Valley remains a hot neighborhood for several reasons. Other neighborhoods such as Pacific Heights and the Marina District have already been in such demand that prices are often out of reach for younger families, DeSimone says. Noe Valley remains more affordable but still has the kind of row houses desired by families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also closer to Silicon Valley than other neighborhoods in northern San Francisco, which shaves off about 20 to 30 minutes of commuting time (<span class="companylink">Google</span> and Apple both have bus stops in Noe Valley). And many buyers want historic Victorians, so demand for homes in the neighborhood is strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why, when homes are priced well, they can set off a bidding frenzy -- even in an anemic real estate market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose for the second-consecutive month in May, bolstered by a federal tax credit that drew more buyers into the market and drove up demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose 1.3% in the 20 biggest cities from April to May, a report Tuesday by the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index found. The jump is largely due to the heavy spring buying season and the residual impact of a home buyer tax credit that expired April 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit provided first-time home buyers up to $8,000 toward the purchase of a home, and caused a flurry of buying activity before it ended. Prices may be up because even though the credit expired, home buyers are finalizing sales through the end of September, and the index measures prices when the contracts are closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is always a lag between sales activity and prices, so prices will still be up even though home sales have begun to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I wouldn't expect prices to begin falling for another three months or longer," says Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics. "That's why things can look so good when the sales data looks so bad. In the next four or five months, prices will drop back. I don't think we should be excited. It won't last."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And home sales are dragging. Existing home sales fell 5.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.37 million units in June from 5.66 million in May, the National Association of Realtors says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From April to May, 19 out of 20 cities showed price gains -- with Minneapolis leading the way with a 2.8% jump, followed by Atlanta with a 2% rise. Las Vegas fell 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index rose 4.6% in May from a year earlier. But as of May 2010, average home prices across the USA are only back to the levels where they were in the autumn of 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the tax credit gone and foreclosures at a high level, prices are expected to drop. A high number of foreclosures dampens prices because banks are willing to sell homes at a lower price than owner- occupied properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In three or four months, 15 cities (in the Case-Shiller index) will see prices drop," says Patrick Newport, with IHS Global Insight. July's home "sales will be really, really bad. They have quite a ways to drop." He expects the index to drop another 6% to 8%, then turn around in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While economists have been warning of a drop-off in prices and home sales, Newport says he doesn't expect it to derail the housing recovery. Rather, the key to a sustained recovery is to see strong growth in the job market. That will lead to the creation of more households and more demand for housing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home buying swelled in June, but only to a level that was still the second lowest on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report from the Commerce Department was further evidence of the housing market's weakness following the expiration of the federal home buyer tax credit in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales last month jumped almost 24% from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 330,000. That compares with May's estimated annual rate of 267,000, which was the slowest pace on records back to 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May's rate was revised down from 300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government said Monday that it also revised downward its estimates for April and March sales. A new home is counted as sold when a deposit is made or a contract is signed. That's why sales peaked in April, because buyers needed signed contracts by April 30 to claim the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the latest revisions in earlier months' sales show the tax credit had less effect than once thought. The government has cut April's annual sales rate from the originally reported 504,000 to 422,000. March's sales rate has fallen from 411,000 to a revised 384,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a new home fell to $242,900 in June, the lowest since October 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're horrible numbers," says Patrick Newport at IHS Global Insight. "It's a really bad market for builders. They were only good numbers because in May they were worse. They're just abysmal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in sales in June could be a sign that sales are picking up, but it's still an anemic sales climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of unsold new homes slipped to 210,000 units, the lowest level since September 1968. The turnover rate, or the median time it takes for a home to sell, dropped by 1.7 months to 12.4 months. During normal times, homes sell within five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright spot is that inventory of new homes fell to its lowest level since the survey was started 42 years ago. The supply of homes fell from 9.6 months in May to 7.6 months worth in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales prices are down in part because builders are slashing costs but also because homes today are smaller and cost less. Builders can only cut prices so much because they must recoup their construction costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is scant demand for new homes because many buyers are instead purchasing foreclosed or other existing homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They can't compete. That's just the reality," says Joel Naroff at Naroff Economic Advisors. "Going forward, growth is going to be sluggish for 18 to 20 months. We need to double the sales pace before we can even say we're back to normal, and that's a lot of sales. And what happens when mortgage rates are higher?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased from May in three regions. They were up 46% in the Northeast, 33% in the South, and 21% in the Midwest, but fell nearly 7% in the West.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder confidence fell for the second month in a row in July as an expired federal tax credit and public unease over the economy depressed housing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) reported Monday that its housing market index dropped 2 points to 14, its lowest level since April 2009. Although still above its recession trough of 8, index readings below 50 signal a poor market. The index hasn't been in positive territory since April 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures of future activity also fell. Potential buyer traffic fell 3 points to 10, while six-month sales expectations were at their lowest level in 16 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak job formation and public uncertainty over the economy are chilling housing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit also remains tight, following the expiration of a tax incentive that rewarded qualifying buyers with rebates up to $8,000. Home sales grew in the first half of the year as people rushed to take advantage of the program. After the provision's April 30 expiration, new home sales and housing starts in May fell 32.7% and 10%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A wave of foreclosures is also hampering a return to normal market conditions. Second-quarter home seizures rose 38% year-over- year, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernard Markstein, NAHB vice president and senior economist, says that foreclosed homes pump cheap supply into the marketplace, placing downward pressure on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Foreclosures definitely need to level out. We've got to get a handle (on) foreclosures and help people stay in their homes," said Denise Jacoby, executive officer of the Frederick County (Md.) Builders Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices in Frederick have risen for six consecutive months and are near their 2003 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markstein sees other seeds of hope, citing historically low mortgage rates, long-term trends of population growth and homeownership, and a recent uptick in auto sales.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States and local governments are slashing spending on schools, roads, offices and other construction projects so fast that even federal stimulus money hasn't filled in the gap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment in infrastructure is on pace to drop almost 7% this year to $269 billion, according to a USA TODAY analysis of federal data. That would be the first decline in state and local construction spending since the Census Bureau started tracking in 1993.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cuts are driven by several factors, including voters' reluctance to take on more debt, falling building costs and fewer new residential subdivisions that require roads and other infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stimulus program has helped soften the blow. It will pump $135 billion into state and local construction projects over several years. The types of spending favored in the stimulus bill are booming. Airport spending is up 12%. Mass transit work is up 17%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the core of infrastructure spending -- on schools, sewers, water plants, prisons, fire stations -- has experienced sharp drops in nearly every category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even spending on roads is down 4% in the first four months of 2010, mostly because cities have cut back on repairs even as stimulus money has boosted new projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's easier to postpone building a library than to lay off librarians already on staff," says Ken Simonson, chief economist at the Associated General Contractors of America, a construction industry trade group. "Construction is always vulnerable when spending gets cut."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cutbacks are hitting the nation's 90,000 state and local governments, including cities, counties, school districts, universities and utilities. Columbus, Ohio, didn't resurface any streets last year except for nine paid for by stimulus funds. Alaska cut funding for proposed hydropower plants. Grand Junction, Colo., may scale back a big new fire station that voters approved in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's behind the cuts:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Voter unrest. Voter approval of bond issues to finance construction has fallen sharply, from 82% in 2008 to 66% in 2009 -- and 59% so far this year, reports The Bond Buyer, which covers government finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Real estate hardship. The housing collapse means less need for new roads, sewers and schools. The Clark County, Nev., school district, which includes Las Vegas, abandoned plans to build $7 billion in new schools and has no plans to build any.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As bad as government has it, the private sector has it worse. Private construction has fallen one-third since its peak and is now at the lowest level since 2001. States and local governments have returned to the spending level of 2007.</p>

</div><div class="author">John Waggoner </div><div>696 words</div><div>25 June 2010</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.6</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You could hold a rodeo clown convention in most office buildings these days without disturbing the few workers left inside. So why are real estate investment trusts, which buy and sell commercial property, doing so well?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average real estate fund -- most of which invest solely in REITs -- has gained 11% this year, vs. a 1.1% loss for the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index, including reinvested dividends. The average REIT has gained 14.7%, says the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), a trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those are swell numbers in a distinctly not-so-swell environment. "It's been a bit of a surprise," says Ken Heebner, manager of CGM Realty fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for such big gains: Investors may think things can't get much worse. They have a point. The unemployment rate in May was 9.7%, down slightly from its 10.1% peak in October. Nevertheless, 15 million people were looking for work at the end of May, a situation that doesn't argue for rising demand for office space or shopping malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walk through the average office building, and mostly what you'll hear is the sound of your own footfalls. Office vacancy rates were 15% at the end of the first quarter, vs. 14.7% at the end of 2009, according to Cushman &amp;Wakefield, a global real estate firm. Rents are down 6.6% from a year ago, to $36.88 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial leases tend to be relatively long-term ones, Heebner says. Even if the economy were to turn around tomorrow, office REITs might not feel the benefits for another two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has improved? Credit. At this time last year, Wall Street viewed REIT borrowers the way slugs view salt, which meant that REITs had a hard time raising money for purchases or acquisitions. The supply of new commercial real estate is low, which is unusual for a real estate cycle. Just as the top of the stock market is marked by a flood of dubious new issues, the hallmark of a toppy commercial real estate cycle is hundreds of unnecessary office parks. Were commercial real estate developers so wise and prudent that they cut back their building as the top approached?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course not. But the boom in residential real estate drove the price of construction laborers up, slowing new commercial construction projects. The dizzying rise in the price of raw materials in 2007 and 2008 also made new commercial construction expensive. So new supplies of office space were somewhat restrained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The expectation is that we're at or near a bottom" in occupancy levels, says Steve Shigekawa, co-manager of Neuberger Berman Real Estate fund. "If the economy continues to improve, we expect that vacancy rates will start to come down and see occupancy picking up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem: After a strong run, "These are relatively expensive stocks," Heebner says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Heebner and Shigekawa favor lodging REITs, which invest in hotels. "Demand is picking up for lodging, travel is improving, and we're seeing group bookings pick up as well," Shigekawa says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're going to buy individual REITs, look for strong balance sheets. Nearly all REITs are borrowers; look for REITs with lots of cash and multiple sources of capital, Shigekawa says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs distribute nearly all of their income to investors, and the average REIT yields 4.6%, say NAREIT. If you're an income investor, make sure the REIT is paying cash dividends. Some cash-strapped REITs are making their payouts with stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top-performing REIT funds are in the chart. Index fans should consider the Vanguard REIT Index fund (ticker: VGSIX) or its exchange-traded cousin, the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A commercial real estate boom could be years off, so don't look for outsize returns anytime soon. Nevertheless, you can earn decent income while you're waiting for the office to fill back up.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales tumbled to a record low in May after a government tax credit for home buyers expired, raising more concerns about the outlook for housing's recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes fell 32.7% from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 300,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That was the lowest since the government began compiling data in 1963. New home sales data are based on contracts signed, not closings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price in May was $200,900, down 9.6% from a year earlier and the lowest since December 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report followed Tuesday's news that existing-home sales fell 2.2% in May, surprising economists who had been expecting an increase. That's a concern because renewed weakening in the housing market could delay a broader economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For home builders, last month's plunge in sales points to competition from a glut of existing homes for sale and a significant dropoff in buyer interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The gauges are all saying the credit really increased sales and pushed them from May and into April," says David Crowe, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of May was a low 213,000. That represents a supply of 8.5 months at the current sales rate, up from 5.8 months in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the plunge in May contracts, the inventory of unsold new homes shrank last month to the lowest level in more than three decades. The continued decline in inventory puts builders in a better position once demand picks up, which should be this winter, says Bernard Baumohl at The Economic Outlook Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To woo buyers, 56% of home builders are reducing prices or offering optional items at no cost -- the same percentage as before the tax credit expired. The tax credit provided up to $6,500 for move-up buyers and up to $8,000 for first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">R. Randy Lee, CEO of Leewood Real Estate Group in New York, which has built about 6,000 homes in the past 20 years, is offering to match the amount a purchaser would have qualified for under the federal guidelines, and apply it as a credit toward closing costs, until July 4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We finally were able to see this spring that the tax credit was encouraging business," Lee says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To claim the tax credit, buyers had to have a purchase contract by April 30 and must close by June 30. Congress is considering giving buyers who met the first deadline until Sept. 30 to close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent reports that help measure the market for home builders are also pessimistic. Housing starts fell 10% in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home builders have seen sales fall off sharply in May," says Mark Zandi, at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "They're nervous about whether this is temporary or whether sales will be a lot weaker."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span> had expected to see a dropoff in sales, but it's not yet sure what impact the end of the tax credit will have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Who knows what the hangover is going to be," says Caryn Klebba, a <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span> spokeswoman. "We do know we expect to be profitable for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've moved away from building on 'spec' and didn't build on 'spec' for the tax credit."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes took an unexpected tumble in May, disappointing economists who had expected a federal home buyers' tax credit to deliver more impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of the expected increase, existing home sales dropped 2.2% from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.66 million units, the National Association of Realtors reported Tuesday. April's home sales rate was revised upward to 5.79 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May sales were 19.2% above the year-ago rate of 4.75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To qualify for the tax credit, buyers had to have a binding purchase contract by April 30. They have until June 30 to close on their purchase to get the credit. Because sales are counted when they close, the tax credit was expected to give some boost to sales through this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bump may even be larger this month as April's pending sales move to closing. NAR says lenders' delays in processing loan applications may mean as many as 180,000 home buyers could miss the June 30 deadline to close on their purchases. Congress is considering giving those who met the April deadline three additional months, until Sept. 30, to close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Processing delays could have been a factor in last month's dip in home sales, says Mark Zandi, at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was disappointed. I had expected an increase in response to the credit," Zandi says. "People are having trouble closing. ... It could also reflect that underlying demand remains soft with 10% unemployment. But I believe it's trouble with completing closing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists had forecast a sharp drop in sales after the tax credit disappeared, but May's figures could mean sales this summer and beyond won't plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think sales being down is bad news," says Patrick Newport, with IHS Global Insight. "It shifted sales, so we're not going to see as deep a drop in sales in July."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newport expects sales to drop the most in the South and West in the next two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the NAR, says the housing market's key test will come later in the second half "when housing is on its own without any stimulus."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median existing home price for all housing types was $179,600 in May, up 2.7% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales by region:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Northeast. Sales fell 18.3% from April. The median price was $240,200, down 2.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Midwest. Sales were unchanged from April. The median price was $150,700, up 2.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*South. Sales rose 0.5% from April. The median price was $159,000, up 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*West. Sales rose 4.9% in May. The median price was $221,300, up 7.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed homes slipped to 31% of sales last month, compared with 33% in April and 33% in May 2009.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands of pending home sales may be in jeopardy unless Congress extends the June 30 deadline for buyers to close on their deals and claim a tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate on Wednesday approved a three-month extension, giving buyers until Sept. 30 to close, but it's attached to another bill that still has to be passed by the House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extension would apply only to buyers that met the April 30 deadline to have signed purchase contracts in hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit is worth up to $6,500 for repeat buyers and up to $8,000 for first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many pending deals are in danger of not closing by June 30 because of delays that aren't the buyers' fault. Some appraisals are taking longer to complete, and some lenders have been overwhelmed by a crush of mortgage applications that landed before the tax credit expired April 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up to 180,000 buyers who were hoping to close by June 30 and get the tax credit are likely to miss the deadline, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are hopeful," says Paul Bishop, vice president of research with NAR. "We've heard a lot of concern from Realtors out there. There seems to be a sense of fairness. The tax credit was essentially promised" to those buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some Realtors say even if a three-month extension is granted, that still won't be enough time for buyers pursuing houses through short sales, which can take many months to close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"How are you going to close a short sale in two months?" says Edward Goldfarb, a Realtor with Keller Williams in Fort Lauderdale. "Hundreds of people are not going to close and are going to lose their tax credit. September is not any better. A short sale can take a year and a half."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another concern is that buyers who face losing the tax credit could pull out of pending deals altogether. Any extension must be passed this week, or buyers will start canceling deals next week, before the deadline hits, says Richard Smith, president and CEO of <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>, parent company of Century 21, ERA, Coldwell Banker and <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're concerned, as many people are, that this will force people to cancel their contracts," Smith says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Bonime, 33, has a contract on a home in Margate, Fla., but is worried the short sale won't close in time to get the $8,000 tax credit he was counting on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It'll put a dent in things financially," says Bonime, who works in management at a supermarket. The sellers "had brand new appliances they're taking with them, and we were going to get the money now so we can get appliances."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest problems facing the real estate market in Loveland, Colo., is a shortage of low-price homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the city, which is south of Fort Collins, there are few homes below $150,000. "I have numerous buyers, but there is no inventory to put them into," says Renae Hupp, president of the Loveland- Berthoud Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When first-time home buyers were trying to take advantage of the now-expired tax credit, there were multiple offers for many of the affordable homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Home sales rose about 34% in April from a year earlier as buyers hurried to sign contracts to meet the tax credit deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loveland and Berthoud, a small community nearby, are outside Rocky Mountain National Park and have always attracted many retirees. In February, AARP listed Loveland as No. 1 among the 15 best places for Baby Boomers to reinvent a life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is known as a relaxed, artist community. Unlike Denver, which expanded more rapidly, Loveland managed to avoid much of the housing bubble. Home sales have not experienced huge highs and lows. For example, in April 2008, home sales were up 7.2% from April 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. April's median sales price -- $199,900 -- was up about 9% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures have been falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Larimer County, which includes Loveland, foreclosure filings dropped about 15% in the first quarter from a year earlier. They rose 6% across Colorado.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. The job market is stronger than in other parts of the state. The unemployment rate in Fort Collins-Loveland was 6.4% in March, below the state rate of 8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although many residents work in Fort Collins and Greeley, Loveland has a <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> facility, a <span class="companylink">Woodward Governor</span> energy control systems plant and a new medical center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Lake Loveland is one of the most desirable areas to live. "It is the heart of the city, and from there you can walk to downtown," Hupp says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most homes that are close to the lake are high-end. But just across the street are more affordable properties: One home is priced at $154,000, Hupp says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abilene, a former frontier town in west central Texas, steered clear of the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our small and midsize communities have fared pretty well," says James Gaines, a research economist at Texas A&amp;M University's Real Estate Center. "Like most of them, Abilene didn't have a run-up in housing prices and didn't have much in a way of a bust."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have remained steady, but there was a buying rush before the recession, when money was flowing and it was easy to get a loan, Gaines says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In the past couple of years, home sales have been fairly resilient, says Robert Calk, president of the Abilene Board of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home buyer tax credit lifted sales, especially in April, when many buyers were rushing to get homes under contract before it expired. April sales were 6% higher than in April 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. It's been a good market for buyers but not sellers. In April, the median sales price -- $104,600 -- was 8% lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the local economy is stable, uncertainty about the weak national economy led many sellers to lower their prices to draw offers, Calk says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drawn by the tax credit, first-time buyers purchasing lower- priced homes have generated the most recent sales. That also has pulled down the median price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Job strength also helped the housing market. The unemployment rate in Abilene was 6.4% in March, lower than the state rate of 8.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dyess Air Force Base, just outside Abilene, is the largest employer. "It's not the largest base, but it is a substantial local employer for civilian workers as well as for military personnel," says Terry Clower, the director for the Center for Economic Development and Research at the University of North Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Abilene serves as a regional medical center for surrounding counties, and it has two state correctional facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Abilene neighborhoods are generally considered homogenous. They are laid out so that it's quick and easy to get across town from any location, Calk says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a few neighborhoods are sought by first-time buyers, says Mary Smithson, the residential sales manager at Coldwell Banker Panian &amp;Mash. In Mesquite Forest, for example, home prices start at about $100,000, and its school district is highly regarded.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market in Tuscaloosa, Ala., is reliable and predictable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tuscaloosa has always been pretty stable," says Johanna Shirley, president of the Tuscaloosa Association of Realtors. "We have been fortunate because we have not been as affected by the bubble as other markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even with last month's expiration of the home buyers' tax credit, sales are still brisk. "I've been so busy that I'm drained," Shirley says. "I'm not complaining. It's a good problem."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. April home sales were up about 12% from a year ago, fueled partly by the tax credit deadline. This year, sales are about 19% higher than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it wasn't the only factor. Tuscaloosa is home to the University of Alabama and DCH Regional Medical Center. Both are large employers, Shirley says. And jobs bring in home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Tuscaloosa has seen some overbuilding of homes, pulling down prices in recent years but not dramatically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At one time, we had a lot of new construction," Shirley says. "Several years ago, it was 30% of our market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that new construction has slowed and inventory is declining, prices are expected to go up. In April, Tuscaloosa's median sales price -- $143,569 -- was 1.7% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Tuscaloosa's diversified economy has bolstered the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tuscaloosa is one of the very strong parts of the economy in the state of Alabama," says Keivan Deravi, professor of economics at Auburn University at Montgomery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa benefits from the nearby Mercedes-Benz assembly plant, which employs about 2,800. That's down from 4,000 two years ago, but Mercedes-Benz said in December about 1,000 jobs will be added when it moves some production to the plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate in Tuscaloosa was 9.6% in March, better than the state's 11% rate. The outlook is good. "They have everything going for them," Deravi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. One area where home sales have been steady and prices affordable is South Tuscaloosa or South of Town. It draws first-time buyers because small, newly built garden homes sell for about $150,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families like the recreation center and park, the local schools and Shelton State Community College, says Sherry Singley, a real estate agent at Allied Realty &amp;Development.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEATTLE -- John Stoeck is building a one-bedroom, 437-square- foot cottage on the spot where his garage stood before a tree fell on it. Construction costs: about $50,000. When the cottage is finished this summer, he plans to rent it for at least $900 a month, which will make a nice dent in his mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His is just one of about 50 tiny cottages sprouting in backyards across the city as it tries to expand affordable housing options in established neighborhoods without resorting to high-rises and apartment complexes. The city changed zoning rules to allow cottages in single-family neighborhoods citywide, rejected a proposed cap of 50 cottages a year and helped organize a design competition to spur creation of reasonably priced plans. The point is not just to allow the cottages, but to encourage them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I want to preserve rural areas around Seattle, and I don't want the suburbs continuing to march on without any limits. One way to do that is to add more density to these inner-city neighborhoods," says Stoeck, 47, an architect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Backyard cottages are a promising way to address the need for affordable housing without diminishing the character of urban neighborhoods, and they're creating more options for families who want to live near an elderly parent or adult child. "It's harder and harder for working people to live in the city," says former Seattle mayor Greg Nickels, now a fellow at the Harvard University Institute of Politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The backyard homes, he says, also help ease traffic jams and reduce pollution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle tested the backyard cottages initiative in the southeast part of the city starting in 2006, resulting in 28 cottages. It was expanded citywide in December, and 22 more building permits have been issued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other cities such as Denver and Faribault, Minn., are allowing for the first time or expanding programs that encourage backyard residences to accommodate growing demand for affordable housing in the wake of the recession and foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike attached "granny flats" or basement apartments, backyard cottages are separate buildings, often just a few feet from owners' homes. Once built, owners such as Stoeck either rent out the cottage or rent out their main home and move into the cottage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides expanding housing options, backyard cottages have another benefit: "It's really a way to help people hang on to their homes," says Andrea Petzel, senior urban planner for the city of Seattle. She expects about 40 to be built each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Denver City Council votes next month on a zoning code that for the first time would allow "accessory dwelling units," including detached cottages, in some residential areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would "balance our housing opportunities and at the same time add density" in areas where affordable rentals are scarce, says Peter Park, community planning and development manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faribault, Minn., which has a rental housing shortage, began allowing freestanding backyard dwellings in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It can be a good thing if you have the proper controls in place," zoning administrator Greg Kruschke says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santa Cruz, which has some of California's highest housing prices, encourages backyard cottages citywide, and about 40 are built each year. Santa Cruz "did not want to price people out of living here," says Carol Berg, the city's housing and community development manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept evolved from the carriage houses where employees or extended families lived near grand homes in the early 1900s, says Dana Cuff, professor of architecture and urban design at UCLA. That changed in the 1950s, she says, when the American dream meant owning a single-family home on a big lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to adapt our living environment to the kinds of families we have now," Cuff says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have two people working in nearly every household now, so people don't need as big a yard," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other benefits: Owners' rental income can help fend off foreclosure, and aging parents can move into cottages to maintain their independence, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Backyard cottages "don't suit everyone, but they're really right for some people," Cuff says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her view is borne of personal experience: A decade ago, she and her husband moved into one on their Santa Monica property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics cite privacy concerns</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle needs room to grow: Almost two-thirds of the city is zoned for single-family homes. Its population rose from 563,374 in 2000 to 602,000 last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses are pricey here. The median cost in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $305,500, compared with the national median price of $172,900, the National Association of Realtors says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nickels had been intrigued by the idea of backyard cottages for decades before he became Seattle's mayor in 2002 and made it a priority. Opponents argued that it would double the city's density, he recalls, but he felt "there was no excuse other than political cowardice not to move forward."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the first batch of cottages was built in southeast Seattle, a survey of people who lived near them turned up a surprise: More than half the neighbors didn't know they were there, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some critics of the Seattle initiative still worry that backyard cottages will clutter neighborhoods, clash with existing homes, create parking shortages and attract irresponsible renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle architect and developer Marty Liebowitz says the cottages could rob neighbors of the privacy they want to "barbecue, entertain guests and walk around naked if they're kinky."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle arborist Michael Oxman has another concern: If the idea catches on and many cottages are built, he says, they "would decimate the urban forest of Seattle." Inevitably, he says, trees will be removed to make room for cottages and parking spaces for owners and tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chuck Cady, who has sold Seattle real estate for 30 years, says cottages probably increase the value of lots where they're built but might hurt the value of homes adjacent to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you've got a lovely backyard that's totally private, it's worth more than one with a two-story, butt-ugly addition looking down on your backyard," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Seattle, "none of the worst-case scenarios happened," Petzel says. Getting city permits for a typical single-family home can take about three months, but for cottages the turnaround time can be as short as six weeks, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle City Councilmember Sally Clark, a proponent of the initiative, says design standards were written to help ensure neighbors' privacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Backyard cottages can be built only on lots of 4,000 or more square feet, height is limited based on lot width, and entrances must face away from neighbors. At least one property owner must live in the main house or cottage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sometimes they actually improve the neighborhood," says Diane Sugimura, Seattle's director of planning and development. "We don't believe the majority of homeowners will choose to do this, but it really provides another option ... and it allows you an income source."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'A great spot'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">College student Laura Chamberlain, 20, would love to live in a backyard cottage. She's tired of overpriced apartments near campus, and the expansion of Seattle's light rail system makes living away from school more practical, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A cottage would be a great spot for me while I save enough money to buy a house, and unlike condo living, I might be able to grow my own vegetables," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stoeck, who shares the main house with his wife, Jennifer, and son Colin, 9, says that because the cottage is just steps from his back door, choosing the right tenant is important. So is keeping his neighbors happy: He gave them a tour of the cottage and assured the people who live next door that his tenant won't be able to see into their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have to be careful about the context and scale of the neighborhood, but I think the idea is great, and I'd do it again in a second," Stoeck says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clark says the economy helped prove cottages' value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In a recession people are definitely looking for ways to pay the bills and for lower-cost housing options," she says. "Seattle had an overheated rental market, so folks who had backyard cottages had something that was desirable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Leigh, 57, took a different approach to the cottage initiative. He built a bigger new house in front of an existing tiny one on the back of his lot in West Seattle. The houses are for sale. "If people want affordable housing," says Leigh, a land surveyor, "this is one way to help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are tough choices to be made as population increases. Do we really want to keep building out where people have to commute? I think we're better off getting more density in the city."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less is more for some</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yolinda Ward and Lynn Watkins bought a four-bedroom Craftsman- style house in Seattle's Columbia City neighborhood four years ago after falling in love with its architectural details and expansive yard. Soon, the couple decided the house was too big, so they built a 600-square-foot cottage behind and over the existing garage and moved into it. They rent the "big house" to Ward's godson, Erik Norwood, his wife, Rebecca, and their two children. A friend rents the basement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Watkins, 60, had to forfeit part of her garden space to build the cottage, she loves living in it. "It's easier to clean and everything's right here," she says. The bedroom is on the ground level; upstairs there's a kitchen and living room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Original designs for the cottage included big windows facing the back door and deck of the "big house," says Ward, 61. They decided to move the windows to overlook the garden and eliminated them on the wall with a view of the big house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Privacy is important, but being close to her godson's family is part of the appeal, Ward says. She can open a window near her desk and chat with almost-3-year-old Jaeda when she's playing outside. There's a big family meal every other Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cottage cost about $135,000, Ward says, and added about $200 to their mortgage payment -- an increase covered by the rent they receive, which also covers increased property taxes. The property, appraised at $560,000 before the cottage was added, now is worth $710,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only drawback the couple can think of is that they don't have room for overnight guests. Watkins still has room for a garden, and the "green" elements they added -- including extra insulation, a water heater that kicks in only when hot water is needed and the recycling of runoff water -- keep expenses low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a very easy way to get regular income, and it will pay for itself," Ward says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strangers sometimes knock on their door to ask about the cottage - - and how they can build one, too.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are showing signs of weakening and could slide still further now that tax credits for home buyers are no longer around to spur sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city composite index of home prices fell in March from February, the sixth-consecutive monthly decline, S&amp;P reported Tuesday. Prices fell in 13 of 20 metro areas represented in the composite index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national home price index also fell 3.2% in the first quarter from the fourth, but both it and the 20-city composite index are up compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're beginning to see the beginning of weakness," says Paul Ashworth, senior economist at Capital Economics, adding that price declines may come close to reversing any price appreciation seen so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credits "have been quite a shot in the arm short term, but there's a good chance house prices will fall again," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credits provided up to $6,500 for move-up home buyers and up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers, and many rushed to purchase homes before the credits expired last month. Now prices and sales are expected to fall without the federal stimulus boosting sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A growing supply of homes for sale also is expected to dampen sales and prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total housing inventory at the end of April rose 11.5% to 4.04 million existing homes available for sale, which represents an 8.4- month supply at the current sales pace, up from an 8.1-month supply in March, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in the Case-Shiller index could continue to fall and bottom in 2011, says Patrick Newport at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're going to see a sharp drop in demand because the tax credit isn't there," Newport says. "There is more supply. But demand has also grown because interest rates are really low and employment has picked up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year, fixed mortgage was 4.84% for the week of May 20, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That was the lowest rate since December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Case-Shiller report, average home prices in the first quarter were close to the levels of 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metro areas posting new index lows in March were Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas, New York, Tampa and Portland, Ore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P reported that eight metro areas showed significant gains from their troughs in prices. Los Angeles is up 7.2%; Minneapolis, up 7.4%; San Diego, up 10.9%; and San Francisco, up 16.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Diego has seen 11 consecutive months of increasing home prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roanoke, Va.'s real estate market avoided the housing bubble but couldn't sidestep last winter's snowy weather. In January and February, even the federal home buyer tax credit didn't help spark sales. But buyers popped up in the spring, and sales have come to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Things slowed a little, but there are definitely buyers and sellers out there now, and we didn't see the market fall off a cliff," says Richard Limroth, president of the Roanoke Valley Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In April, home sales were 14.2% higher than in April 2009. Many first-time home buyers took advantage of the tax credit. And some move-up buyers who also took the tax credit closed contracts before it expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Sales may have perked up, but prices are still down. Although the Roanoke Valley hasn't suffered much home foreclosure, it has had enough to keep prices down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past three to four years, home prices dropped about 18% to 20%, Limroth says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Roanoke Valley's median sales price was 4.5% lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But I think we have hit bottom," Limroth says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Roanoke Valley is a southern Rust Belt city that has been moving into a service-oriented economy, says Terry Rephann, regional economist at Weldon Cooper Center, University of Virginia. The area has a lower unemployment rate because it is less reliant on cyclical industries than it was in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It now has industrial parks for high-tech start-ups and a medical center and teaching hospital. The Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine has brought jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate in the Roanoke metro area was 9.7% in March. But Roanoke County's rate was much lower, 6.7%, because more white-collar professionals live in the suburbs, Rephann says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Roanoke's downtown has been revitalized in recent years, and a neighborhood just a walk away has also attracted attention. The historic Old Southwest has tree-lined sidewalks, good schools, shops and outdoor cafes, Limroth says. And it has gained attention from urban dwellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes were built between the 1880s and 1930. The architecture includes colonial, Georgian and Tudor, among others. Prices range in value. Even a first-time buyer can find a small home in the $200,000- to-$250,000 range, Limroth says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul and Martha Higginbotham are selling a French colonial-style</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales jumped in April as buyers rushed to take advantage of home buyers tax credits before they expired last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased 7.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.77 million units in April from an upwardly revised 5.36 million in March, according to a report Monday from the National Association of Realtors (NAR). That's 22.8% above the 4.70 million-unit pace in April 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists attribute much of April's boost to buyers' scramble to buy homes before the deadline for the tax credit, which provided up to $6,500 for move-up buyers and up to $8,000 for first-time buyers. Sales are expected to weaken after June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought the market would get a nice impact (from the tax credit)," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist with NAR. "But (growing) inventory is raising a little concern. It could put downward pressure on prices. Through June, sales will be elevated, and after June, measurably lower."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median existing-home price was $173,100 in April, up 4% from April 2009. Distressed homes, which include those sold at foreclosure or short sales, accounted for 33% of sales last month. Distressed properties tend to bring down overall home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total housing inventory at the end of April rose 11.5% to 4.04 million existing homes available for sale, which represents an 8.4- month supply at the current sales pace, up from an 8.1-month supply in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent rise in home sales is attributed to other factors along with the tax credit. Home prices in general have fallen so low that they're luring more buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates also have hovered around a low 5%, making it an attractive time to purchase a home, says Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everything sort of just lined up," Hoffman says. "You had a very active market. (But) the upward momentum won't be sustained at this pace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Naroff, at Naroff Economic Advisors, says he expects sales will fall fairly sharply in the next couple of months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are going to get a couple of months of softer sales," Naroff says. "But there are enough factors out there to provide growing sales throughout the year. I also think prices are going to go up."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A snapshot of Fayetteville, N.C.'s real estate market doesn't paint a clear picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As home sales pick up nationally, Fayetteville sales are down, seemingly illustrating a dreary housing scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Fayetteville never saw the housing boom and bust much of the nation saw, largely because of the Fort Bragg military base. The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure law transformed the base, generating revenue and jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Because of Fort Bragg, we have a lot of stability," says David Evans, president of Fayetteville Regional Association of Realtors. "We didn't drop like the rest of the nation, nor did we ever go through the roof."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In March, home sales were 11.9% lower than in March 2009. In part, that is due to tighter credit, which stymies home buyers, Evans says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fort Bragg expansion has brought in military and civilian home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparing monthly gains and losses often leads to skewed numbers, because the influx of new resident home buyers can vary month to month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the federal home buyer tax credit has expired for the general population, it is still available to military personnel who have been serving outside the country for 90 days or more. And that could spark more sales. "They have a year extension to still use the tax credit," Evans says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. The area is known for its reasonable home prices. Coldwell Banker's 2009 Home Price Comparison Index listed Fayetteville as the third-most-affordable market in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the Fayetteville area's median sales price was 7.7% lower than a year earlier. Some builders have focused on lower- priced homes, which reduced prices on existing homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. The Fayetteville area weathered the recession, because jobs remained steady, says Mike Walden, an economist at North Carolina State University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The good news is that the military has expanded," he says. "But the bad news is that the area in essence is a one-company town. If there ever was a decision to scale back the military, they would be hurt."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate was 9.1% in March, lower than the state rate of 11.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fort Bragg also drives private-sector businesses that supply military personnel. The textile industry traditionally has been strong in the Fayetteville area; the area is shifting to high-tech textile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. As families move to Fayetteville, they often are zeroing in on homes near Jack Britt High School. It's a hot spot because the school, which opened in 2000, has become one of the premier schools in North Carolina. New construction abounds in surrounding neighborhoods and subdivisions. Homes with nice size lots are affordable and sell quickly, says Fran Braden, a real estate agent at Re/Max Homeowners. In the neighborhoods near Jack Britt, the home prices range from $80,000 to $1 million-plus.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are widely expected to fall now that a tax credit for home buyers has expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's raising concern about a possible double dip in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National housing prices stopped falling early last year and rose 0.3% over the 12 months ended in February, according to a study by real estate analytics firm CoreLogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm predicts prices will fall this year before starting to rise again in late 2010. Even so, next February's prices are likely to be 4.2% lower, it forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices will struggle for maybe another year," says Mark Fleming, CoreLogic's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shrunken pool of buyers due to the tax credit's expiration is one reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The tax credit is the big reason home prices have been so buoyant, and sales will drop" with its expiration, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. "You will see a double dip in housing prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason is the number of distressed houses -- including foreclosures and short sales -- that are on the market or that will be in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed homes, typically sold at discounted prices, accounted for 36% of first-quarter sales, the National Association of Realtors reported Tuesday. The first quarter's median single-family home price ($166,100) was roughly flat with a year earlier, despite gains in nearly two-thirds of 152 metro areas that the NAR surveys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's survey isn't the first to show evidence of softening prices. The 20-city <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price index has fallen for five-consecutive months through February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is too early to say the housing market is recovering," David Blitzer, chairman of S&amp;P's index committee, said when the Case- Shiller report for February was released last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may be some good news for sellers in areas not hit so hard by foreclosures. When distressed sales are excluded, CoreLogic's home price index shows a 4.9% rise in U.S. prices from this February through next February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some economists expect home prices to weaken, they don't expect a major drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I wouldn't expect anything like the meltdown we've had over the past couple years," says Jay Feldman, senior economist at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Greater Boston housing market dodged much of the real estate meltdown and is showing signs of improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unclear if the market will continue to rebound, though, now that the federal first-time home buyer tax credit has expired. But buyers can still take advantage of low mortgage rates and decent prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is still a pent-up demand," says Mel Martocchia, president of the Greater Boston Association of Realtors. "The key is if people feel comfortable with their employment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In March, home sales were 46.7% higher than in March 2009. That was the seventh-consecutive month of sales increases in Greater Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-buyer tax credit reinvigorated the market, Martocchia says. It wasn't the only reason, but it made a huge difference if people had been on the fence about buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers helped stimulate higher home sales as existing homeowners bought more-expensive homes. "Everything builds on itself," Martocchia says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Home prices in the Boston area did not fall dramatically during the housing bust, in part because the area didn't have much new home construction. As home to universities and the financial and high-tech industries, the city experiences a seemingly constant demand for homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home foreclosures did not wreck the market. Martocchia says many bank-owned properties have had multiple offers and have sold for more than the listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. "Life has been easier during the recession in the Boston area," says Michael Lynch, regional economist at IHS Global Insight. Not only was it insulated from much of the housing bubble, but also employment remained stronger than in many other parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The metro area unemployment rate was 7.8% in March, lower than the state rate of 9.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial jobs have been vulnerable, and even the education sector has been affected by the recession as some projects have been delayed. But universities provide a higher concentration of jobs, and they've had a stabilizing influence. "They're not going anywhere," Lynch says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some good signs. Among them: Payrolls have hit bottom and are starting to turn the corner, Lynch says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods: Melrose, about 7 miles north of Boston, is being discovered by many different types of home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When people start having families, they often want a yard and a bigger house, and move to a community such as Melrose, which is more suburban but still has downtown shops and restaurants, wooded paths and bike trails, says Linda O'Koniewski, broker/owner of RE/ Max Heritage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher gas prices in recent years started attracting another group of homeowners who prefer the nearby commuter trains to Boston to spending money driving long distances to work. The area offers many Victorian homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A broad range of home prices exists, but first-time home buyers will pay about $350,000 to $450,000, O'Koniewski says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive home</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson </div><div>474 words</div><div>20 April 2010</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The darkest cloud over the economic recovery -- the troubled commercial real estate market -- may be clearing a bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of commercial property are up slightly compared with last fall. Loan modifications have risen sharply the past six months. Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), a big funding source that was comatose for two years, has come to life recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developments won't alleviate the sector's biggest problem: the rising pace of defaults. But they should contain the damage and provide a lifeline to better-performing properties, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers put up too many commercial buildings earlier this decade and paid the price when the economy wilted as vacancies rose and rents fell. Default rates jumped to 3.8% from 1.6% in 2009 and will hit 5.1% this year, <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many larger deals were financed by CMBS. Investment banks bundled loans for several projects into securities they sold to investors. A record $230 billion in securities were issued in 2007 vs. $3 billion last year, Commercial Mortgage Alert says. Already this year, $4 billion in deals have been done. Tom Fink of research firm Trepp predicts about $25 billion in CMBS will be issued in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors and banks have waded back into the market because property values have bottomed and lending standards have toughened, says David Nackoul of mortgage broker <span class="companylink">Holliday Fenoglio Fowler</span>. And with bond interest rates at low levels, investors are seeking higher yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money isn't rescuing distressed properties. It's refinancing high-quality loans as they mature. Even borrowers who bought projects before the real estate bubble have had a hard time refinancing because of scarce funding and lenders demanding higher down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Glimcher, CEO of <span class="companylink">Glimcher Realty Trust</span>, recently snared $100 million in loans that will be sold into the CMBS market. He'll use the money to refinance loans for shopping centers in Tennessee and Ohio after struggling to refinance malls last year. "The pipeline has opened back up," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The funds' availability also could help some borrowers whose properties have fallen in value since they bought them but who are still making payments, Fink says. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> analyst Richard Parkus says most of the $1.4 trillion in mortgages maturing by 2013 won't qualify for refinancing unless borrowers put up more cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could lead to foreclosures, further depressing prices, though many lenders have extended loans on the hope prices will rebound. The new capital "will moderate (the slump)," Fink says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other good signs:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Commercial real estate values have edged up 6% in recent months, <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> says. They fell 45% from 2007 to 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*About $13.7 billion in loans were modified the past six months, Parkus says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who says you can't have it all? Not fans of Sandpoint, Idaho.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small town, with a population of about 8,000, has won accolades as a retirement hot spot, an outdoor sports mecca, even one of the top 10 cities for telecommuting. It serves as the national headquarters for several notable companies, including Coldwater Creek apparel, attracting a young, vibrant workforce and fueling the local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's the big appeal? A combination of stunning natural beauty, excellent year-round outdoor activities and a surprising wealth of art and cultural offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sandpoint is located in the Panhandle of northern Idaho and sits directly on 43-mile-long Lake Pend Oreille (pronounced "pond-uh- ray"). Though winters are typically cold and snowy, the summer months are marked by long strings of warm, sunny days. The Selkirk and Cabinet mountains overlook the town, offering options for hiking, climbing and mountain biking. The Schweitzer Mountain resort, 12 miles away, spans almost 3,000 skiable acres with 92 trails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both visual artists and performers make their homes here, and Sandpoint offers a lot of live music. In addition to regularly scheduled art exhibits and art walks, the town is host to one of the largest film festivals in the Northwest, and a major 11-day summer music festival attracts big names.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Panhandle also is popular for golfers, and outside Sandpoint is a high-profile private golf club, the Idaho Club. There is a public course on nearby Priest Lake, two nationally ranked public courses and two more high-end private clubs around Coeur d'Alene, less than 50 miles away. Another popular second-home community on a large lake, Coeur d'Alene offers additional dining, cultural and recreational options to Sandpoint buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With 111 miles of shoreline, (Sandpoint's Lake Pend Oreille) is considerably bigger than Lake Coeur d'Alene, but there is far less traffic. You often feel like you're alone out there," says Patrick Werry, a real estate agent with Century 21 Riverstone. "There is a large variety of second homes around Sandpoint. You can find anything from a 900-square-foot house for $220,000 to a 5,000- square-foot home on the lake for $2.5 million. We have two main options, on the lake or at the ski resort."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEXT OF INFO BOXES BEGINS HERE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at three Sandpoint neighborhoods:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sandpoint. Realtor Patrick Werry says second-home buyers in town are choosing lakefront property, usually in one of two enclaves. Dover Bay sits just outside town, with cottages from under $230,000 to luxury condos for more than $1 million. Seasons is the main lakefront condo development within Sandpoint, a short walk to downtown shopping and dining. "It's all new, nothing more than 5 years old and they are still building, with their own fitness center and spa, on the water but close to everything. Prices range from $500,000 to $2.5 million."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hope. About 20 minutes outside Sandpoint, this small, lakefront community is surrounded by state-owned protected wilderness. "No large developments, just single-family homes for resale," Werry says. "Homes on the water run $500,000 to $2 million, and off the water, $190,000 to $450,000. It attracts those interested in boating and is definitely a second-home spot for summer, very slow in winter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Schweitzer Mountain Resort. "The vast majority are second homes. There are about 700 homes and condos and only 70 full-time residents," says Werry. "There's a wide range, $100,000 to $1 million, and the newest option is fractional ownership, $195,000 for four weeks in a nice, new three-bedroom. There is a lot of ski-in/ out property, plus condos in the main village and single-family homes a mile away." The resort offers summer mountain biking, hiking and an equestrian center.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, Jamie Watt and her fiance, Ben Arnold, expect to own their first home, a three-story townhouse with a spacious deck for entertaining and a spanking-new kitchen with a stone countertop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As first-time home buyers, they're part of a critical demographic shaping the spring housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether enough first-time buyers such as Watt and Arnold come forward in the next few months could undermine -- or stabilize -- the housing market's already wobbly recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much rests on how tantalizing a tax credit of up to $8,000 will be to first-time buyers, but buyers must sign purchase contracts by April 30 to qualify. The same deadline applies to the credit of up to $6,500 for repeat buyers. Time is running out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the spring flowers fade, many believe first-time home buyers could, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know how many first-time home buyers have the money and jobs to be much of a factor once this tax program ends," says Joel Naroff, with Naroff Economic Advisors. "The tax credit concentrated a year's worth of sales into a six-month period. I think first-time home buyers will fade into their normal part of the market after this ends."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands of first-time home buyers -- with weeks left to qualify for the credit -- are now making harrowing decisions that could alter their lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Watt and Arnold, buying their first home was a nail-biting wait to find out if they could get financing. There was falling in love with a house, then hoping the sellers would accept their offer. There was a counteroffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The whole process is completely overwhelming," says Watt, 27, of the $310,000 home they're buying in Crofton, Md. "I can see us there at our little cafe table having breakfast in the morning. I can't wait. It seems like a great place to start a life together and start a family."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates and prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just the tax credit that has first-time home buyers such as Watt and her fiance dominating the spring housing market. Interest rates are hovering around a low 5% on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, and home prices in many markets have fallen to levels that make purchasing as affordable as renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers generally tend to increase as a share of buyers during recessions, but rarely have their numbers been this high; 47% of buyers in 2009 were first-timers, a record high, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's higher than during the 1991 recession, when 44% of buyers were first-timers, and the recession of 1981, when 44% of buyers were also first-timers. Compare that with the housing peak of 2006, when 36% of home buyers were first-timers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with low interest rates and the temporary tax credit, home sales slipped in December, January and February, although most economists are expecting some pickup in March and April as first- time buyers rush to close on housing contracts before the credit ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still plenty of worries</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anxiety about the housing market could keep some first-time buyers at bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Janet Koelsch, a Realtor with Coldwell Banker in Scituate, N.Y., says her first-time buyers are eager to buy but often afraid because of the horror stories they've heard about homeowners losing money in today's tepid housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're really fearful. There's a fear of the unknown," she says. "But the stimulus package is allowing them to buy when they couldn't before. I love their zeal. They're excited; they're like sponges, they want to absorb all the information. I get so emotionally connected to them. It's the biggest thing they can do in their lifetime, other than having a child or getting married."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some first-time home buyers say they overcame any anxiety because they didn't want to miss out on the financial incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Michael Jennings, 27, of Wilmington, N.C., buying his first home in March took three months of looking at more than 15 homes. What finally pushed him to make an offer was the prospect that waiting too long would cause him to miss out on the tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennings, who works in the construction industry, went for a home with a wrap-around porch in an older neighborhood near a shopping center for $238,000, and his seller came down in price. He got a fixed 30-year mortgage with a 5.2% interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The tax credit was a big factor. I wouldn't have moved as quickly as I did," Jennings says. "You really hate to miss out on that chunk of change, that $8,000. And this house had everything I was looking for. I'm very happy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make the down payment, Jennings took out some funds he had invested in the stock market. He plans to use the $8,000 tax credit to replenish those funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new breed of buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers such as Jennings are more than typical home buyers. They're also a unique demographic who are highly sought after by sellers. First-time buyers are pickier than move-up buyers. They're more likely to find their home using the Internet than in years past, and they're likely to have bigger down payments than in years past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers now live on the Internet: 93% used the Web as a search tool, compared with less than 1% of first-time buyers in 1995, according to NAR. Their average age is 30, putting them on the leading edge of Generation Y, a well-educated and savvy generation that wants quick responses and fast turnaround times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are also selective: They spend a median of 12 weeks looking for a home, while repeat buyers spent an average of 10 weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their median income is $61,600, they buy a house with an average value of about $156,000, and their median down payment in 2009 was 4%, up from 2% in 2005. In 2005, 43% of first-time buyers purchased with no down payment; in 2009, that had dwindled to 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors such as Jessica Riffle Edwards of Wilmington say they must work hard to reach out to this younger demographic. She tries to target the first-timer through a video blog, where she'll sit in her <span class="companylink">BMW</span> sedan and videotape herself talking for two to three minutes about various topics of interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's exciting to work with them so they can have this place they can call home," she says. "They're making this awesome step, this first step of purchasing real estate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She believes enough first-time buyers will come forward before the tax credit expires to give a needed boost to the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am seeing a lot more interest, though, from first-time buyers in recent weeks," Riffle Edwards says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of pick-up</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some signs of life already are being seen in housing sales, suggesting the tax credit is helping. Contracts for previously owned homes jumped unexpectedly in February, with the seasonally adjusted index of sales agreements rising 8.2% compared with January, according to the NAR. It was the second-biggest gain on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers "are critical for bringing down inventory. That's what's needed so we can go back to a normal housing pattern," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An earlier tax credit that expired in November caused a surge in first-time home buyer sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, he says, "We may see a very significant second surge," although that's likely to be followed by a drop-off in sales in June through August after the credit expires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, luring first-time home buyers in now is especially vital to building momentum, because interest rates are expected to edge up to around 6% later this year, and that could act as a drag on home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some question the wisdom of using incentives to motivate first-time buyers for the spring housing market. Why drive up sales for a short time, critics say, only to have them fall off once the credit is no longer in place?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I find these incentives to be stupid," says Brett Barry, a broker with HomeSmart in Phoenix. "They're artificially holding the market up and using taxpayer dollars. I don't like it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax credit is fine but ...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some home buyers say getting the tax credit would be nice, but they're not willing to buy a house just to get the financial incentive. They're determined to wait to find the best deal -- even if that means they don't buy this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Rusnell, 24, of Phoenix, has been looking for a house for about a year, but it took awhile before he could clean up his credit and qualify for a loan. He's interested in getting a bank-owned home because he thinks it will likely be a bargain. So far, he hasn't found one in the right location. He'd also like a three-car garage to store all his tools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The tax credit is out the window. Who cares about that?" says Rusnell, a plumbing contractor and father of two boys, ages 4 and 11 months. "I'd like to buy in that time period, but it's become evident it's not going to happen in that time. I just want to get out of renting. It kills me every day sending a check out."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few metropolitan areas escaped the housing bubble and its ensuing bust. But one of them, Sioux Falls, S.D., got a glimpse into the bust this past winter -- because of the weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we doubled our average snow this winter, and a lot of people just stayed inside in December, January and February," says Todd Headrick, president of the Realtor Association of the Sioux Empire, which includes Sioux Falls and nearby towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. February metro area home sales were 11.9% lower than in February 2009. Sales slowed until March, when buyers finally started shopping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, the local housing market has remained fairly resilient, without major fluctuations. But the economic downturn did put a damper on home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We did not see a push back in sales until about the last quarter of 2008," Headrick says. "The early part of 2009 also was a tad bit slow, but then the first-time home buyer tax credit shored up the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. In February, the median sale price increased 3.8% from a year earlier. This year, the best-selling price range has been $200,000 and less as first-time buyers keep snapping up homes, Headrick says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to first-time home buyers, some homeowners are taking advantage of the $6,500 tax credit to sell their homes and become move-up buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home foreclosures have been few: In January, Sioux Falls' foreclosure rate ranked 161 out of 202 metro areas, according to RealtyTrac.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We never had subprime mortgages to any great extent," says Ralph Brown, professor emeritus of economics at the University of South Dakota. "We didn't see the speculative type of building, and we never had the house price appreciation that we saw nationally."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Sioux Falls has not been insulated from the recession, but the severity of the decline in the local economy has been much less than nationally, Brown says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We went into the recession about nine or 10 months later than the nation," he says. "Probably in March or April of this year we expect to begin recovery."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sioux Falls' unemployment rate was 5.5% in January; the national rate, 9.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The service industry provides most of the employment. The biggest player is health care. And the second major player is the financial services industry, primarily credit card operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. The city's downtown is experiencing a renaissance. "In the last few years a lot of investors and developers are focusing on downtown, and they're taking old buildings with character and historic presence and refurbishing them," says Paul Gourley, of Gourley Property, which has downtown loft apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The older buildings date to the 1880s. The resurgence of the historic district initially has added many apartments. But gradually, downtown is starting to also sell condos. The studios start in the $100,000 range, Gourley says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downtown is a trendy area with retail space and restaurants. "It's also close to a few parks, and it's scenic because the Big Sioux River goes by downtown," Headrick says.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FONTANA, Calif. -- The view from a warehouse roof here is consistent. In every direction, there are blocks and blocks of warehouse roofs baking in the Southern California sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than letting them sit bare, a California utility hopes to blanket roofs like these with solar panels to produce enough electricity to power 162,000 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Southern California Edison</span> has installed solar on two warehouse roofs and is working on another in the Los Angeles region. The utility expects to do 100 to 125 more, totaling about 1.5 square miles of roof space in the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program, in which the utility owns the solar, is the largest of its kind in the nation, not surprising since California is the No. 1 solar market. But utilities in other states, including North Carolina, New Mexico, Arizona and New Jersey, have smaller plans to rent roofs for their own mini-solar-power plants, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phenomenon, while in its infancy, presents another way for solar to spread in a bigger way than it has historically done when home and business owners put solar on roofs. The deep-pocketed utilities are planning bigger installations. Yet the systems don't consume green land or require new power-transmission links, as do some massive solar farms planned for deserts in California, Arizona and Nevada. As such, rooftop solar is likely to face fewer environmental hurdles than the farms and can get permits and be built much faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everybody is looking to see how this works," says solar analyst Alfonso Velosa at research firm Gartner. "<span class="companylink">Southern California Edison</span> is the experiment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other utilities in much of the country, Edison is under pressure to increase use of renewable energy, such as solar and wind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has set the goal for California's utilities to get 33% of their energy from renewable sources by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, utilities have looked to other companies to build solar power plants and sell the power to them. But with Edison's rooftop project, it'll own the solar and pay the warehouse owners to rent the space. The power will flow to Edison's grid and serve all kinds of customers, maybe even the building from which it came.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panels are like the photovoltaic panels that go on household roofs. But the roofs are massive, and the panels number in the tens of thousands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">33,700 solar panels on 1 roof</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first roof Edison installed is here, in Fontana, just east of Los Angeles amid a major warehouse distribution hub. From the Fontana roof, 9 million square feet of warehouse roof is visible, Edison says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fontana roof holds 33,700 solar panels over almost 600,000 square feet. It kicks out 2 megawatts of electricity, enough to serve 1,300 California homes. The electricity travels under a parking lot to an existing power line on the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took Edison two months to get the project permitted and two to get it built. Solar farms in California's desert can take years to get permits and to be built. Edison told state regulators that it anticipated paying building owners $20,000 per megawatt per year for rent, or about $20,000 per year for about 250,000 square feet of roof space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't have to use green land, and it's a lot faster," says Mark Nelson, who heads the project for Edison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fontana warehouse is owned by <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span>, a leading global warehouse owner with more than 475 million square feet of industrial space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Denver-based company, which refused to comment on its rent for the Fontana warehouse, has been approached for years by cellphone companies wanting to put towers on roofs and other companies wanting to turn them into billboards. Solar is looking more promising, not only in Southern California but across <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span>' markets, says <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> Vice President Drew Torbin. "We see a big demand," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> started experimenting with rooftop solar in Europe in 2005. In addition to the Fontana warehouse rented to Edison, <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> has solar panels on 10 other warehouse rooftops in the U.S. On those, a third party owns the panels and sells the power to utilities. In the next four years, <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> expects to allow panels on up to 25 million square feet of its warehouse space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a way we can create new value for an existing asset," Torbin says. "It's good for our business and it's good for the environment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the 250 megawatts of solar that Edison expects to own, it expects at least another 240 megawatts to be put on commercial rooftops by other companies that will sell the electricity to Edison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That'll mean more competition for roofs. Edison needs roofs that are less than 5 years old so they'll last while panels run their 20- year lifespans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate firm AMB Property, which owns 22.4 million square feet of warehouse space in the Los Angeles region, has also rented Edison a warehouse roof. It expects rents to rise as Edison and others compete for space, especially given the recession-driven dearth of new construction. "Time is on the side of the building owners," says Steven Campbell, AMB senior vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rooftop photovoltaic model also presents new management challenges for utilities. They've long managed power that flows from a big plant onto the grid. What they don't have is experience managing smaller flows from hundreds of diversely located sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, Hawaiian Electric said it found that electricity supplies from small photovoltaic installations were prone to going off-line when there were disturbances on the power grid -- a situation it's addressing with the solar industry. The utility said it also experienced outages that would not have happened or would have affected fewer customers without so much photovoltaic on the grid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edison says it's confident it can manage the flow, and it spent months developing the technology to connect the roof panels to its distribution system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some consumer advocates disapproved of Edison's plan, saying it would be too expensive for ratepayers. Solar photovoltaic power remains the most expensive renewable source, and Edison's plan would result in power that costs more than twice the average of other electricity sources, including coal and natural gas, says Dave Ashuckian of the Division of Ratepayer Advocates at the California Public Utilities Commission. What's more, other California- subsidized photovoltaic programs provide solar for less than what Edison's will cost, Ashuckian says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photovoltaic vs. solar thermal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While photovoltaic is the type of solar used on homes and businesses, another technology has traditionally been viewed as better for large-scale solar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That technology is solar thermal, in which thousands of mirrors over hundreds or thousands of acres of land concentrate the sun's heat on a liquid, which creates steam that runs a generator to make electricity. Photovoltaic technology generates electricity directly from sunlight via an electronic process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, solar thermal has been considered lower-cost and better suited to big solar farms. But more larger-scale photovoltaic farms are taking shape in California that rival or best the size of some of the proposed solar thermal farms. Several factors have aligned to make larger-scale photovoltaic projects, whether on the ground or the roof, more attractive, including:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Panel pricing. Pricing for solar panels last year dropped 40% from 2008, researcher Navigant Consulting says. That makes solar more affordable and helps utilities persuade state regulators to OK the systems and pass the costs onto ratepayers, says Julia Hamm, executive director of the Solar Electric Power Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Incentives. In the fall of 2008, utilities became eligible to receive federal tax credits for up to 30% of a project's cost. The tax credit was also extended to 2016, giving utilities certainty that they could begin longer-term projects and still get tax credits for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Better technology. Panels no longer need as many, or any, punctures in roofs to be held in place. Instead, they use weights or design. That means there's less risk of leaks and less weight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's taken a decade to get the technology ready," says Julie Blunden, vice president of solar panel maker SunPower, which will supply Edison with panels. That, and lower panel costs, "starts to make it a reasonable proposition," Blunden says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For tourists, Flagstaff is the major gateway to the Grand Canyon. For second-home owners, the historic town about 2 1/2 hours north of Phoenix is its own natural wonder, with year-round access to Arizona's widest range of outdoor activities and moderate summer temperatures. The Grand Canyon, 80 miles away, is a pilgrimage for hikers, but Flagstaff has its own 50-mile urban trail system and is surrounded by national forest land. Mountain biking is popular, and Flagstaff is a departure point for rafting trips on the Colorado through the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a study by Flagstaff's Northern Arizona University, about a quarter of Flagstaff's approximately 64,000 residents are second-home owners. Most have primary homes within a three-hour- drive market that includes Phoenix, Scottsdale and Paradise Valley, plus neighboring Nevada and California. Flagstaff is also popular with Texans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of our buyers come for the summer from hot places, because if it gets to 90 here, that's quite unusual," says broker Paula Monthofer of Realty Executives of Flagstaff. "It's a mountain oasis (with) more of a small-town feel than a city."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flagstaff is the remaining western terminus for Route 66 and has preserved much of the kitschy charm of the old highway, making it a popular site for old car and pop-culture buffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most buyers choose between living in the southern part of the city proper or in the mountains near the ski areas, the Arizona Snowbowl and Flagstaff Nordic Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at three Flagstaff neighborhoods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Southwest Flagstaff. The city's most expensive area revolves around two gated, long-established golf communities targeted specifically at second-home owners. Forest Highlands has two golf courses with homes from $500,000 to about $2 million. Pine Canyon has one course and a mix of condos and single-family houses in the same price range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Fort Valley &amp;Northwest Flagstaff. The Arizona Snowbowl ski area is 14 miles northwest of the city, and the Nordic center is 8 miles farther. The Fort Valley neighborhood at the foot of Snowbowl's access road is the most desirable location, though there are homes between the city and the mountains. "Older but nice homes go from about $300,000," says broker Paula Monthofer, and new custom houses go up to about $1.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Southeast Flagstaff. The city's lowest-priced second-home area is just east of downtown. Second homes are clustered around two golf clubs, Aspen Valley and Continental Country Club. Single-family houses run $255,000 to $575,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robust activity in the Tucson housing market may portend an end to the housing crisis there, even though home prices are still bumping along at low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales are rising as home buyers take advantage of big inventory, sellers willing to deal and the federal home buyer tax credit, says Bob Herd, president of the Tucson Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In Tucson, home sales were up 6.6% in February compared with the same month in 2009. "The first-time home buyer market is very robust, even with multiple offers in some cases," Herd says. "And the move-up market is starting to show small signs of life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit applies to binding sales contracts signed by April 30, with a purchase completed by June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect sales to drop off somewhat at the end of April," Herd says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. In February, Tucson's median sales price was 15.5% lower than in February 2009. That was largely driven by a surge in sales at the low end of the market because of the tax credit, Herd says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arizona still has the nation's second-highest foreclosure rate. But among major metro areas, Tucson ranks 41st, which is much lower than Phoenix, at No. 8, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Herd says home prices have stabilized because foreclosures have dropped. "And lenders have become market savvy about demand and about how to price foreclosures," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. "In the past decade, most of the economic growth was driven by the population growth and the flow of money into real estate," says Marshall Vest, economist at the University of Arizona Eller College of Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's economic pain from the housing bust can be seen in the drop in building permits, which have declined nearly 90% from the peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Tucson's unemployment rate was 8.9%, slightly lower than the state's rate of 9.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building activity is increasing very slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That doesn't mean there is a large upward potential, because we still have a lot of vacant houses to fill," Vest says. "But some buyers want a new home and so there is a niche market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Foreclosure has made some popular areas more affordable, including Dunbar Spring, which is a small, historic neighborhood near downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It has a community garden and a bike path to University of Arizona," says Patty Sue Anderson, a real estate broker at Nest Real Estate. It is culturally diverse and one of Tucson's oldest neighborhoods. Many homes were built in the 1920s and 1930s. Homes prices range from $80,000 to $150,000, Anderson says. Two years ago, prices reached $300,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers rushed to purchase previously owned homes in February, a shift hailed as the long-awaited start of the spring housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seasonally adjusted index of sales agreements jumped 8.2% in February to 97.6 from 90.2 in January, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although many economists had expected a decline, it turned out to be the second biggest monthly rise on record behind October 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After an anemic winter, home sales are now likely to continue showing steady increases, economists say, as buyers rush to complete purchases before a tax credit of up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers expires April 30. They cite other factors, including more jobs and economic growth, that could continue to propel a housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we're starting to see are people who have their eye on the tax credit make some moves," says Joel Naroff at Naroff Economic Advisors. He predicts home sales will continue growing: "Job growth, the economy is coming back; Realtors are listing -- everything seems to be working in the positive side of the cycle."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales rose the most in the Midwest, at 21.8% in February from January. In the West, the index fell 4.8% in February. The Northeast rose 9%, and pending home sales in the South increased 9.2%. The data reflect contracts. Closings usually occur one or two months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheap home prices could also be drawing bargain-hunting buyers. Home prices in January fell 0.4% from December on an unadjusted basis, according to a report last week from the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/ Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anecdotal reports suggest March may also show gains in home sales, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR. That would be critical in helping reduce the overall amount of housing inventory. High levels of inventory dampen prices by reducing competition for homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yun says that there may be some decrease in home sales in June through August, after the tax credit expires, and that higher interest rates near the end of the year could depress sales. Currently, the average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed mortgage is 5.08%, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> says. "I'm optimistic," Yun says. "By year end, interest rates could be closer to 6%. But with the improving economy and buyer confidence, that shouldn't be a hindrance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first-time home buyer tax credit applies to homes purchased on or before April 30 and is equal to 10% of the home's purchase price up to a maximum of $8,000. Congress also approved a credit for move-up home buyers up to a maximum of $6,500. The credits apply only to homes priced at $800,000 or less.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is doing significantly better than nearly anyone predicted a year ago, largely due to the Obama administration's comprehensive response: helping to maintain low mortgage interest rates; helping to ensure mortgage credit access; providing tax credits for home buyers; helping families struggling with their mortgage payments modify their mortgages; and helping to revitalize communities overrun with foreclosures. Thanks to these steps, homeowners actually saw the equity in their homes grow by an average of $13,000 from April through the end of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we are not out of the woods yet. Families still struggle to stay in their homes, communities still struggle with foreclosures and the market still struggles with uncertain house prices. So last week, we introduced initiatives to strike at two of the most important issues impacting the housing market: unemployed homeowners and homeowners who owe more than their home is worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployed homeowners who qualify for the Home Affordable Modification Program will get some relief while they look for work. And for those who owe more than their home is worth, we have created two options to responsibly restructure that debt. Qualified homeowners can modify their loans through HAMP, which now has an added push for lenders to write down principal balances. Or, if a homeowner has kept up payments, qualifies for a Federal Housing Administration-insured loan, and the lender agrees to write down at least 10% of the balance, he or she can refinance into an FHA loan at below the value of the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While we will provide incentives for lenders and homeowners to participate, the real cost of writing down loans will be where it belongs: on lenders and investors, not on taxpayers. As President Obama has said, "We can't stop every foreclosure." Investor properties and second homes aren't eligible, and some homeowners simply bought more house than they could afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration is providing responsible homeowners opportunities to prevent avoidable foreclosures or, for some homeowners, helping them smoothly transition into rental housing. The result will be more sustainable homeownership, stable communities with fewer foreclosures, and a stronger housing market that makes your home an asset you can rely on once again.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices showed little change in January after a welcome rebound last year, and economists say a new wave of foreclosures is likely to yield a lackluster market the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's housing news, along with a report that consumer confidence bounced back smartly in March but remains mired at low levels, underscored the sometimes halting nature of the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the fourth consecutive month, housing prices fell slightly, dipping 0.4% from December on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price index, which tracks 20 large cities. Values dropped in 18 of 20 metro areas, with only Los Angeles and San Diego posting modest gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From May to September, home prices rose 5.3% on the stock market rally and pent-up demand. But the run-up stalled as a first-time home buyers' tax credit expired in November and foreclosures bloated housing stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we've moved from a rebound phase to a if-we-hang-on- everything-will-get-to-where-we-belong phase," says David Blitzer, who oversees the survey for <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news: The stomach-churning real estate crash seems to be history, and the market has stabilized. Prices are down only about 1% since September and 0.7% vs. January 2009, the best year-over- year showing since January 2007. Yet values are still nearly 30% below their summer 2006 peak. Prices in Charlotte, Las Vegas, Seattle and Tampa notched new lows in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seasonally adjusted prices rose 0.3%, the eighth straight increase, though they, too, have been basically treading water since fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big backlogs are preventing a more robust upturn. There was an 8.6-month supply of existing homes in February, up from 7.8 months in January, according to the National Association of Realtors. That's lower than the 11-month buildup during the nadir of the real estate downturn in July 2008, but a healthy supply is six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the foreclosures are hitting the market in the first quarter, economist Patrick Newport of IHS Global Insight says. They'll be partly offset by a second home buyers' tax credit that should modestly goose spring sales, he says. Buyers must sign a contract by April 30 and close by June 30. Still, he says, its expiration, combined with the foreclosures, should push down prices 5% by year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors is a bit more sanguine. He says the tax credit, and the improving economy and job market, should result in a 1% to 3% increase in home prices this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a closely watched index of consumer confidence beat expectations, jumping to 52.5 in March after falling sharply to 46.4 in February on concerns over nearly 10% unemployment, The Conference Board said. The portion of consumers saying jobs are hard to get fell to 45.8% from 47.3%, while those who say jobs are plentiful rose to 4.4% from 4%. The overall index is up from its low of 25.3 in February 2009 but well below normal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "underwater" homeowners on USA TODAY's Thursday front page seem completely perplexed that their homes did not immediately transform into magic ATMs ("Underwater, and with few options," Cover story, News).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One couple is disappointed that their 5-year-old Florida home has yet to result in a $30,000 windfall. A California homeowner will no longer be able to flip her $500,000 "fixer upper," and a Maryland man can't imagine how his home could have declined in value after a six-figure remodel yielding such necessities as a theater and a fitness room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, a Florida resident bought a new home, complete with an acre backyard for his two dachshunds. In the current market, he must now delay retirement because his home value has slid nearly 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forgive my bluntness, but where did you find these people? Some homeowners do deserve our sympathy, if not direct government assistance, but these gamblers are hardly victims. They weren't buying homes. They were buying lottery tickets, and now that their winnings have yet to materialize, the rest of us are expected to pay for their mistakes with higher taxes and government bailouts. Every taxpayer in America should say: No, thank you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's help the newly single parent abandoned by an abusive or addicted spouse, or the longtime homeowner simultaneously felled by downsizing and disease.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Javier Hyland was furious when he got his latest property tax bill from Miami-Dade County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the county put the value of his ocean-view apartment at $417,000. He can't see any way the place is worth more than $400,000 after a meltdown in the South Florida real estate market. Worse, the county assessed his neighbor's bigger, nicer, newer flat at only $407,000: "Is that fair?" asks Hyland, a pricing manager for a shipping company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property taxes in dispute amount to just $360. But Hyland, 37, is appealing his assessment anyway, even though it will mean trudging into city offices to make his case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He'll probably have to stand in line: 143,000 Miami-Dade property owners appealed their property tax bills last year. And Harvey Ruvin, the county's clerk of courts, expects a similar deluge in 2010. Property tax appeals in the county hit 104,000 in 2008 compared with an average 40,000 in normal years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Florida beachfronts to Nevada deserts, fed-up homeowners are challenging property tax bills that have stayed high despite the housing crisis. Retiree Carol Schneider, 63, of Ferguson, Mo., never saw herself as a tax rebel: "In the past, I just paid my taxes whether I agreed with them or not," she says. "But the last tax bill increased so much ... I decided to fight it." She prevailed, persuading St. Louis County to cut her tax bill in half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angry homeowners like Schneider and Hyland say their tax assessments and tax bills haven't come down as fast as real estate prices in the worst housing collapse since the 1930s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're right: Despite a real estate implosion, property tax revenue collected by states and localities actually rose 2.7% last year to $421.8 billion, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property taxes have been a lifeline for flailing local governments, which collect more than 96% of property taxes. Toss them out, and the remaining sources of state and local tax revenue - - including sales and income tax receipts -- sank more than 9% last year from 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you lose your job, (income tax) withholding stops. You stop buying cars and going out to restaurants," which erodes sales tax receipts, says Donald Boyd, senior fellow at the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany, N.Y. "It doesn't work that way with property taxes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes property taxes so different?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Property taxes are often based on outdated market prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot can happen to housing prices between the time properties are assessed and the time the homeowners get their property tax bills. Some governments reassess property only every three or four years. Others wait even longer: "Utah once went 20 years without conducting meaningful reappraisals," Federal Reserve economist Byron Lutz noted in a 2008 paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, Lutz found that it takes three years for changes in housing prices to have an impact on property tax revenue. "The 2009 numbers reflect what was happening in city housing markets in 2007, maybe even 2006," says Christopher Hoene, director of the National League of Cities' Center for Research &amp;Innovation. "They were still picking up some of the growth at the end of the boom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Some local governments have raised property tax rates, offsetting falling home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some places automatically adjust tax rates to keep property tax revenue stable no matter what happens to real estate prices. Others have imposed tax increases to deal with budget shortfalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of rapid population growth, for instance, suburban Gwinnett County, Ga., raised its 2009 property tax rate by 21%. So, many Gwinnett County homeowners are seeing bigger tax bills, even though their home values have fallen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gwinnett County homeowner Scott Johnson, an executive at an Atlanta technology firm, says his home's tax bill went up 15% last year, and its market value fell. "Is it any wonder that people are getting mad?" he asks. "I am going to try to appeal but don't expect much luck."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gwinnett County is expecting 10,000 appeals this year, vs. 7,500 in 2009 and 5,000 in ordinary times, says county assessor Steve Pruitt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Most states limit how much property taxes can rise in a booming market. That keeps a house's taxable value below its market value. In some cases, the gap remains even after housing prices have fallen. Which means some homeowners are seeing bigger tax bills for homes that are worth less than they were the last time their property taxes came due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1995, for instance, Florida instituted a constitutional amendment limiting increases in the tax assessments on owner- occupied homes to no more than the consumer price inflation rate or 3% (whichever was lower).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After an exhilarating run-up and a gut-wrenching decline in housing prices, some homes' taxable values are still below their market values, leaving room for higher tax bills. In Palm Beach County, for instance, 25% of properties will see an increase this year in their assessed values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This at a time when existing homes in the county's West Palm Beach and Boca Raton were selling for 4% less in February than they were a year earlier and 44% less than they were in February 2006, according to the Florida Realtors trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unsurprisingly, Palm Beach County government has been hit with a surge in property tax appeals -- from 5,477 in 2006 to 14,578 last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's very hard to explain to the average Joe," says Tom Barnhart, Palm Beach County's director of appraisal services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confusing taxes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, property taxes are bewildering to many homeowners. There's confusion about where the taxes are coming from: Some areas pay special property taxes for schools or other government services. There's confusion about the dates of the assessments and the way taxes are calculated through a maze of exemptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're still in the dark about much of this," says Kelly Alexander, a Princeton, N.J., homeowner who is contesting her tax bill after seeing her home assessed at $1.48 million, up from $1.1 million in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also confusion -- and anger -- over what's needed to contest a property tax bill. In determining a home's value, local governments often want to see what comparable homes sold for -- but only from the same time period when the tax assessments were calculated. If your home was assessed in January 2009, for instance, the local tax authorities don't care that your neighbor's home sold for a huge discount last week. And many local governments throw out distressed sales such as foreclosure auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pete Giancola, who owns an insurance agency in Deephaven, Minn., is poised to challenge his tax assessment this year. Scott County, where he lives, has warned that property assessments and taxes are headed up. "They're saying my property went up 6%."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Giancola has been collecting sale prices for homes near his. Unfortunately, "50% of the data I'm gathering is for foreclosures or short sales" -- in which the proceeds fall short of what the home seller owes the bank, he says. The county won't consider distressed sales when it weighs the appeal, he says, exasperated: "We're in a full-blown recession, for God's sake."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pete Sepp, vice president for policy and communications at the National Taxpayers Union, estimates that 2% to 3% of homeowners appeal their property taxes and that 20% to 40% of them win. "The odds of winning some kind of reduction are better than most people perceive," Sepp says. "If they knew that the appeal process was reasonably straightforward and that they had a fighting chance of obtaining a reduction, I imagine that many more folks would investigate further."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers benefit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specialty firms and law offices are lining up to help them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madison, Wis., tax attorney Don Millis says property taxes now account for "70% of what I do," up from less than half three years ago. His clients are mostly businesses fighting taxes on commercial properties, but increasingly he represents upscale homeowners, too. He sometimes finds ways to persuade tax authorities to be more flexible in accepting sales in weak real estate markets. "Like beauty," he says, "distressed sales are in the eye of the beholder."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle entrepreneur Charlie Walsh last year started ValueAppeal, a service that lets you go online for free to see whether your local government is overtaxing your home, based on whatever criteria are used in local property tax appeals. "The rules do vary from county to county," Walsh says. "We spend a lot of time doing the research so the customer doesn't have to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm has so far rolled out its services in nine counties in six states, looking for those that are overtaxing their residents. It plans to cover 50 more counties by the end of the year. If you have a case, ValueAppeal charges $99 for a report you can use to contest the tax bill. You get your money back if the appeal fails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax appeals are putting strains on local governments already coping with a weak economy, dwindling overall tax revenue and budget cuts. Clark County, Nev., which includes Las Vegas, expects property tax appeals to reduce revenue by about $150 million in the next fiscal year, which starts July 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a disconnect between values and taxes at this point," says Rocky Steele, assistant director of assessment services in Clark County. "Values went off the planet" a few years ago. "You'd see signs advertising houses 'from the $150s,' and they'd paint that out and say, 'the $250s,' and then paint that out and say, 'from the $350s.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, the Nevada Legislature imposed limits protecting property owners from big tax increases, creating a gap between taxable and market values. Then Las Vegas housing prices went into a free fall -- but some still haven't fallen enough to close the gap and cut homeowners' tax bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the gap between assessed and real values is now closing. And soon state governments will likely see property tax revenue begin to shrink. Fitch Ratings, which analyzes government debt, predicts "weakness in property tax revenues for at least the next two years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for now, property taxes seem to defy gravity. And taxpayers across the country are hopping mad about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minneapolis last year received an especially unusual appeal: one filed by the city assessor himself, Patrick Todd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Todd decided to challenge his own office after it assessed an investment property he owned at $166,500. He'd bought it in 2008 for only $90,000. The assessors, he said, hadn't realized it was a fixer- upper, not comparable to nearby homes in better condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Todd decided to drop the case when the publicity got too embarrassing. After all, only a few hundred dollars were at stake. "It was getting so much notoriety," he says. "It was such a silly thing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says the experience was educational. "I had never appealed. I actually learned how to do it. I went down. I filed my fee. I got the paperwork. It was relatively painless."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 120 million Census forms have gone out, and a second mailing is underway to prod procrastinators, but the Census Bureau is going to have to send an additional 1.6 million to addresses it missed the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 2,600 governments appealed the Census address list for their communities, requesting that almost 1.8 million addresses be added, says Philip Fulton, director of an independent appeals panel. The group has been poring over tax and utility records, building permits, aerial photos and other evidence submitted to support the appeals. "We accepted 91% of the appeals," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevada's Clark County, home of Las Vegas, appealed the largest number, submitting more than 47,000 additional addresses to a list that already had about 750,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After we analyzed the Census address list to check it against our database of built properties, we noticed they were off ... quite a bit lower than the number of units we currently track and we tax," says Jon Wardlaw, assistant planning manager for the county.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the 47,000-plus are addresses for apartments or condominiums in multiunit buildings, some of them recently built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City submitted 36,181 addresses, and "they (the appeals panel) accepted all of them," says Joseph Salvo, director of the population division in the city planning department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The lion's share are housing units in smaller buildings -- meaning under 10 units," he says. "They're one- or two- or three- family housing in the extra apartments, the attics, the basements."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city found the missing addresses in 27,300 buildings, a large chunk of them in Queens and Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Thirty-seven percent of all appeals are in Queens," Salvo says. "It's the middle-class suburban borough and the home of the largest contingent of immigrants in New York City."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homes with multiple units may have one doorbell or one mailbox and appear as a single address, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau will try to send forms to some of the added addresses in its second mailing, which starts this week. The rest will have to wait until the middle of summer, when forms will be hand-delivered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities fight to include every housing unit because much is riding on a complete count, including the number of seats every state gets in the U.S. House of Representatives and the allocation of more than $400 billion a year in federal aid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City, which has a population estimated at 8.36 million in 2008, hopes to hit 8.4 million in the 2010 count. "The total housing unit count in our master address file is 3.45 million," Salvo says. "We've done all our calculations. That housing unit number can fully support a population of 8.4 million."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, 46% of U.S. households that received forms in the mail have returned them, according to the Census Bureau's daily tracking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final participation rate was 72% in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mail-back response in New York City so far is 32%. It's 43% in Clark County.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Manchester-Nashua area of New Hampshire is often cited by magazines as one of the best and cheapest places to live in the nation. With no state sales and income tax, and only about 50 miles from Massachusetts, it's home to many Boston workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even this area, known for its New England thrift and resourcefulness, did not escape the housing market's boom and bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We did have a bubble and overbuilding," says Thom Nofsinger, president of the Greater Manchester/Nashua Board of Realtors. It started in 2003 and hit a downturn in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area is closely tied to the Boston economy, which is still fragile, the Federal Reserve said in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Even last year's first-time home buyer tax credit of $8,000, which was originally due to expire in November, didn't provide much of a boost. "We thought that a lot more people would get off the bench and get interested in purchasing a home," Nofsinger says. "What has been holding people back seems to be their fear of losing income or employment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's some optimism that people will take advantage of the expanded tax credit, which requires buyers to complete a purchase by June 30. In Hillsborough County, which includes Manchester and Nashua, home sales were up 17.3% in January compared with January 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Home prices were down 7.3% in 2009 compared with 2008, and they continued to decline at the start of the year, mostly because of foreclosures and short sales, Nofsinger says. In January, Hillsborough County's median sales price was 3.4% lower than the same month a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now that the inventory is coming down and fewer foreclosures are expected, Nofsinger hopes prices will climb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. The Manchester metro area is usually fairly insulated from national economic troubles but didn't escape the recession. "Businesses really cut back to the bare minimum just to try to get through this," says Anita Josten, a research analyst at the state Department of Employment Security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, Manchester's unemployment rate was 6.7%, about the same as the state's but much lower than the national rate of 10%. Jobs have declined in retailing, its largest employment sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people who live in Manchester and Nashua work in Boston for major hospitals and in financial services. Now it seems that more are out of work and in the job market, Nofsinger says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. The drop in prices has helped more families move into Nashua. It is the second-largest city in New Hampshire, but it has retained the charm of a New England town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have plenty of social entertainment and community activities," Nofsinger says. Nashua has a symphony and a minor league baseball team. And it's close to the state's seacoast and the White Mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in some popular Nashua neighborhoods near the Central New Hampshire Turnpike, which extends from Massachusetts to Concord, N.H., are 20% to 25% lower than they were in 2005, Nofsinger says. With average prices at about $299,000 to $325,000, it's not for first-time home buyers. But it's a family-friendly area.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Harmer didn't think he'd have a problem getting a $50,000 line of credit for his 33-year-old air-conditioning business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First Class of Cape Coral, Fla., was profitable. Harmer's net worth was $2 million, and he'd never been late with a loan payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Florida Gulf Bank denied his application last summer, saying First Class' balance sheet didn't show a profit. Harmer explained he reclassifies company earnings as his wages at year's end to lower his taxes, a technicality that hadn't posed a problem for his previous credit lines at other banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Harmer tells it, a bank executive was eager to approve the loan, but he said he simply couldn't. "He said, 'Our hands are tied because the government says you have to follow these guidelines,' " Harmer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida Gulf CEO Bill Valenti confirms regulatory scrutiny in such cases has gotten stricter, though he wouldn't discuss Harmer's loan request specifically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the USA, banks say there's a big reason they aren't lending more: Regulators won't let them. Even as the White House exhorts banks to open the lending spigots, particularly for small- business borrowers who are key to job growth, banks say government field examiners are toughening their reviews in ways that discourage sound loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., a former bank examiner, recently laced into top banking regulators. "We have this huge disconnect between what's going on here in D.C. (and) what's actually been going on out in the field," he told them at a joint hearing of the House Financial Services and Small Business committees. "Quite frankly, you guys are part of the problem."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank examiners -- including those at the Federal Reserve, the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency -- don't approve or deny loans. However, bank executives say examiners are downgrading the ratings of performing loans simply because the collateral -- typically, commercial real estate -- has fallen in value or the borrower is located in an economically distressed state. And they're making banks exceed the minimum levels for capital and bad-loan reserves. Those practices, they say, fail to consider banks' familiarity with their communities and borrowers. And they constrict lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The bank examination climate today is perhaps the most severe in two generations at least," says Cam Fine, CEO of Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA). "It's like a reign of terror, particularly on the community banks," which serve a disproportionate number of small firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In public statements and interviews, regulators say they've repeatedly told their examiners to encourage banks to lend to creditworthy borrowers. Examiners, they say, are generally fair, affording bankers ample leeway to make their own judgments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, officials acknowledge that examiners are more vigilant in light of the lax credit standards that triggered steep downturns in housing and commercial real estate and a continuing rise in the number of loan defaults and bank failures. Since early 2009, 177 banks have shut down, and more than 700 are on the FDIC's "problem bank" list. Commercial real estate -- which makes up nearly a third of community banks' loan portfolios -- continues to be plagued by rising vacancies and plummeting value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, officials concede, examiners may go too far sometimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There may be instances in which individual examiners have criticized small-business loans in an overly reflexive fashion," Elizabeth Duke, a member of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, told the House hearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair told a gathering of community bankers this month: "What I want you to understand is that we hear your concerns. We are trying very hard to achieve a balanced approach to supervision during these challenging times."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small firms, many jobs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say small businesses are vital to the recovery because they generate two-thirds of new jobs. Yet, they can't expand or hire employees without cash. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets, which cater to small businesses, sliced their business loans at a 12.8% annual rate in the fourth quarter. Unlike large companies, small concerns can't raise money in capital markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the reduced lending can be traced to lower demand from small businesses as a result of poor sales in the recession. And the supply of loans has dwindled as banks tightened credit standards the past few years, says Raj Date, head of the Cambridge Winter Center for Financial Institutions Policy. Only half of small-firm borrowers in a National Federation of Independent Business poll said most or all of their needs were met last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the economy recovers, many banks say harsher exams are hindering their efforts to increase lending. In an informal ICBA survey, 52% of banks said they have cut business lending as a result of recent examinations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators have issued guidance three times in the past 15 months urging examiners to encourage banks to lend to creditworthy borrowers, most recently in early February. Recent statements pointedly instructed them not to lower a loan's rating simply because the collateral value has fallen. Such "write-downs" force banks to set aside more in loan loss reserves, leaving less for loans. Regulators have held training sessions with examiners to emphasize these points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But 82% of banks surveyed by ICBA in January said previous guidance had not yielded more balanced exams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of Harmer, the air-conditioning retailer, Florida Gulf's Valenti says the bank could make such loans, even if a firm showed no profit, but it would have to increase loan loss reserves, reducing cash for other lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an FDIC examination in September, Valenti says, examiners forced him to get a new appraisal of an office building that was collateral for a $2 million loan. Its value was halved, requiring him to downgrade the loan and add to reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FDIC Assistant Supervisor Steve Fritts says examiners won't write down loans simply because collateral values fall. But agency chief economist Rich Brown says a drop often signals reduced cash flow, potentially affecting loan payments. And if the borrower defaults, "the only thing to pay off the loan" is a property sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Valenti concedes rents from his borrower's office tenants fell. Still, he says, the seven-year customer "is still making payments and has never been ... late. As a community banker, you know your customers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Bridgeman, CEO of Pinnacle Bank in Orange City, Fla., described his last examination in November as "overwhelming." Twenty- one examiners from both the FDIC and the state showed up at his tiny 28-employee bank for the month-long review, spilling into two conference rooms. Typically, he says, about eight examiners complete a review in two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pinnacle had been profitable until last year, but as more commercial real estate loans soured, the bank lost $1.8 million in 2010. About 3% of its loans are delinquent or in default, a big jump the past year but less than the industry average. Bridgeman says Pinnacle comfortably exceeds minimum capital-to-assets ratios of 5%, or 10% when figuring in riskier loans (for banks, assets are mostly loans). The standards ensure banks can withstand some bad loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Bridgeman says examiners told him they would recommend he bump those ratios to 8% and 12% to be deemed "well capitalized."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Why? Because we are a Florida bank, with Florida real estate as collateral," he told the House panel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because capital is scarce, Bridgeman says, he has all but stopped lending, letting loans roll off his books or foreclosing on some properties to boost his capital ratios. That, he says, further depresses property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDIC's Fritts said he could not discuss a specific bank. But he said examiners don't assume all loans in a distressed state or region are suspect. Each loan "is evaluated on its own merits," he says. "You don't impute what happens somewhere else to what happens with that loan."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, however, "We do expect bank management to know what market conditions are. If an area has a huge number of condominiums for sale and a bank has new loan requests to construct condominiums, sure, that's a factor."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mixed messages</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bridgeman says examiners also criticized what he calls modest loan growth -- 23% since early 2008 -- as "too aggressive." He says they assailed him for using $4.4 million from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program for lending rather than building capital and loan loss reserves. Bridgeman shifted the remaining $2 million he planned to use for loans to those purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're being asked to help spur the economy and create jobs, and on the other hand, they're saying, 'You need to raise your ratios,' " Bridgeman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fritts says TARP funds were not earmarked solely for capital. But "if an examiner said you need to use TARP money for capital, it's because" he believes the bank's capital reserves are low, in light of the risks posed by its loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other banks say regulators sometimes turn into seers. In California, Steve Andrews, CEO of <span class="companylink">Bank of Alameda</span> in California, says examiners are downgrading performing loans because they expect cash flow to fall sometime in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Long, chief national bank examiner in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, says examiners are told not to "crystal ball" market conditions, but he adds some forecasting may be warranted. If an office building's tenants are paying $40 a square foot but 75% of the leases are coming due in eight months and area rents have fallen to $18, Long says, examiners will say, " 'You've got an issue here.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrews insists examiners miss nuances. For example, while 70% of his portfolio is in commercial real estate, he says the bank often requires 40% down payments, reducing his exposure. He says he would like to decrease his share of commercial real estate loans, but "You can only take what your market offers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In California," he says, "there's a fair amount of commercial real estate on the books. It's tough to change that boat around on a dime."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Menzies, president of Easton Bank &amp;Trust in Easton, Md., says limits on loan concentrations for commercial properties are intended to provide guidance, but examiners often treat them as hard caps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long says portfolios heavy in some sectors, especially commercial real estate, are volatile. "If you get too much of something, and that sector goes bad on you, it may not take too much of a high wind" to topple it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Risk aversion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some banks are shying away from anything but safe loans. In Beloit, Wis., Blackhawk Bank CEO Rick Bastian wanted to make a several-million-dollar loan last summer for a start-up food processor to install a new production line. "They had very good management, a killer product and a killer marketing plan," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Bastian passed. "It was a relatively new company and a relatively large loan." Plus, he says, the portion of manufacturing loans in Blackhawk's portfolio was at 13%, exceeding guidelines. "We said, 'No, maybe not,' " in light of his examination last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are clearly signals from the regulatory authorities that risk aversion (and building capital) is more important than meeting the credit needs of your community," Bastian says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fritts has a different view: "If everything is sound and (the borrower) can repay that loan, we want you to make it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, Fritts concedes, examiners are more cautious after the financial crisis. "Are examiners more careful because we've seen some bad things happen? Yeah, of course. Is that examiner overzealousness? Absolutely not."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Jennifer and David Wakefield bought their home at the end of 2005, they believed its value would rise. After all, the couple they had bought it from made a $100,000 profit in just three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But instead, the housing market foundered, and the house in Oviedo, Fla., that the Wakefields bought for about $230,000 is now worth just $115,000. Jennifer Wakefield says she's put off hopes of moving to a larger home. She once thought she could use a home- equity loan to help cover the $30,000 cost of adopting a child, but now there's no equity to tap into.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're in the middle of adopting our first child and would have loved to have used a home-equity loan to borrow from -- if we had home equity," says Wakefield, 32. "Now, we're faced with coming up with $30,000."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wakefields are among the owners of more than 11.3 million homes nationwide that are now worth less than the mortgages on them. The housing market collapse wiped out about $7 trillion in housing value from the third quarter of 2006 through the end of 2009, according to the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gone are the days when households relied on their homes' ever- rising values as family piggy banks that would pay for everything from new cars to college tuition. Legions of borrowers who once thought they could count on equity in their homes as a financial safety net are finding there's nothing there. Instead, they're discovering it may take years before their homes are worth as much as they owe on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A typical borrower who is "underwater" won't see positive gains in equity until 2015 to 2020, depending on the market, according to a study of 10 major metro areas by First American CoreLogic for USA TODAY.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a rude awakening. There's a total change in thinking going on," says Amy Bohutinsky of <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, a real estate website. "People got caught up in the idea you could borrow against your homes, but they no longer think of them as savings accounts. We're going through a big psychological shift. Will this recession change how we think about our homes? Are they an investment vehicle or a place to live?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vanished home equity is hurting young homeowners, who are finding they can't relocate for jobs or promotions, and older borrowers, who are realizing they don't have equity to tap for retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'What if I want to move?'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 39, Tage Woehl already fears for his family's financial future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woehl, of Eastlake, Calif., is about $80,000 underwater on a home he and his wife, Imelda, bought for $430,000 in 2003. He's locked into a 5.99% fixed-rate mortgage that no bank will refinance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To hold down other expenses, the Woehls go without cable TV, and he's holding onto his 1999 Dodge Intrepid, which has 188,000 miles on the odometer. The Woehls' daughter, Nika, is only 4, but Woehl, an accountant, already is worrying about how he'll afford college tuition in 13 years. He says he feels like he's lost his financial life jacket: "It's not too comforting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woehl says it sometimes feels unfair that other homeowners who don't pay their mortgages on time get federal bailout assistance in the form of mortgage modifications and lower monthly payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm the one who's paying every month, and when all is said and done, I'm scraping by," he says. "We can't refinance. We're upside- down now. What if I want to move? I'd like to be closer to my job."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's also older borrowers without young children who are frustrated by their financial situation and feel stuck because they are underwater on their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vicky Dicristo, 64, bought her home in Soquel, Calif., in 2006 for $535,000 with plans to fix it up, live in it awhile, then sell and buy a nice retirement home in Arizona, where she has family. She bought the home with a five-year, interest-only, adjustable-rate mortgage at a 5.9% interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her home is now worth $350,000, according to the local assessor's office. And Dicristo, who was laid off nearly two years ago from her job as a mortgage loan underwriter, has lost the $135,000 she put down on the house as well as the more than $15,000 she put into renovating the home with new floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I lost $150,000," Dicristo says. "I haven't been able to make payments, either. I thought I was going to be able to sell it and move to a less expensive area. That had been my plan when I bought it, to move to someplace like Arizona and pay all cash. But that whole plan fell apart."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dicristo is in growing company. About 24% of all residential properties with mortgages had negative equity at the end of 2009, according to First American CoreLogic. That's up from 10.7 million and 23% at the end of September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dicristo can't sell her home and move, but she may be forced to leave. She no longer can afford the payments on her home and expects to be foreclosed upon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She's living on Social Security and unemployment and drawing $800 a month from her $200,000 retirement account, but she says she has no choice but to walk away from her current home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her credit score had been close to a sterling 800, reflecting the type of borrower many banks would lend to at low interest rates. Because she's been unable to make her mortgage payments, she believes her credit score has sunk to about 500, a score that would make it difficult for her to get a home loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dicristo's state, California, is among the top five states where negative equity is most concentrated. But it's not in the lead. Nevada had the highest percentage of negative equity with 70% of its mortgaged properties underwater, followed by Arizona at 51%, Florida with 48%, Michigan with 39%. California came in at 35%, according to First American CoreLogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dicristo, losing equity in her home has meant losing the cash she sank into it and losing much of her retirement dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Emotionally, this has had a very big impact on me," she says. "It's changed how I view housing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When foreclosure looms</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Losing equity has also cost Henry Oviedo, 75, an engineer, his retirement dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He bought his home in 2005 in Owings, Md., for $642,000. It did not have a complete basement, so he spent nearly $100,000 to put in an office, a small theater, a bathroom, a fitness room and a big living room. He took out a five-year, adjustable-rate mortgage at 5.85% interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he went to refinance recently, his home was appraised at $590,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oviedo says he has been unable to get his home refinanced because he is upside-down. Nor has he been able to get his mortgage modified. Oviedo is now paying $3,200 a month, but come November, he could face higher payments when the 5.85% rate on his mortgage will be adjusted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He must retire this year, and Oviedo says his Social Security check won't be enough to pay his mortgage. His wife, Giselda, is unemployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am very worried," he says. "I put $100,000 into the house. It's very uncertain what is going to happen. I would have liked to have had this as my home in retirement, but I am going to have to go into foreclosure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem of negative equity is getting worse. The average equity amount that an underwater borrower was in the hole for in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $70,700, up from $69,700 the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without equity in their homes, many homeowners no longer have collateral for personal loans that financed new cars, vacations, home improvements and college educations before the housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-equity lending has plummeted. Lenders made $77 billion in home-equity loans or lines of credit in 2009, down from $430 billion during the housing boom in 2006, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's not likely to change any time soon until equity picks back up," says Guy Cecala, CEO of Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as Americans wind up owing more on their homes than they're worth, concerns are mounting that more may choose to simply walk away from their mortgages -- a practice known as strategic default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the value of the mortgage is more than the value of the home, homeowners begin to show a willingness to strategically default on their mortgages, especially when the value has fallen by 15% or more, according to a 2009 study by researchers at Northwestern University, European University Institute and the University of Chicago. That could lead to more foreclosures and further depress home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The negative equity problem also is threatening future inheritances. Many homeowners who counted on their home equity as a substantial part of the estate they'd pass on to their heirs are now worrying about the welfare of their spouses and children after they die.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Riley had thought the equity in his home would provide for his wife, Dawn, and provide an inheritance for his three adult children. Now he fears it will just be a financial albatross for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His home is one of the 2.2 million in Florida with negative equity. He and Dawn, of Tallahassee, spent $220,000 five years ago and took out a fixed mortgage on their four-bedroom, one-story home that backs up to a lake and includes a 1-acre yard for their two dachshunds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A nearly identical home across the street recently sold for about $180,000, and Bob guesses they're at least $20,000 underwater on their house. He used to work as a concrete salesman but is currently out of work. Dawn sells insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's frustrating, Bob says, because there's a home they'd like to buy with more square footage that's newer, but they'd have to write a check just to get out of their house. He says they've paid off all their bills and are now trying to decide whether to continue paying the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It'll take years for the equity to get back," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four or five other homeowners in his neighborhood, he says, have simply walked away and left their properties to the bank. And there are other hard realities to come to terms with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob, 60, says he'll have no home value to pass on to Dawn or his three grown children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had thought he could take out a reverse mortgage on the home. That's when a homeowner who is older than 62 borrows money from his or her home. It isn't paid back until the owner dies, sells the home, or permanently moves out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can't retire. I'm looking for work," Bob says. "I thought whatever we'd have, I'd pass away and leave the house to her, and she'd have a reverse mortgage to live off of. Now we don't know what we're going to do."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHENZHEN, China -- In this former Chinese fishing village where skyscrapers are springing up almost as quickly as the population of 9 million is growing, it's not hard to find people who think real estate prices will keep rising, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zhao Jin is a believer. In late 2008, as sales of the licorice- scented tea that Zhao exports from Hunan province took off, he bought a modest three-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of Shenzhen. The property's value has soared 63%, prompting an avalanche of calls from property agents asking whether he wants to sell (the answer is no).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Property prices will definitely go up more," says Zhao, who, like many others, moved here for job opportunities. "I'm an example of why the demand for real estate is there. People hear their country boy did good and come to seek their own fortunes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The migration of China's rural dwellers to its cities, along with rising income and the population's aversion to debt, explain why many think soaring real estate prices pose little immediate threat to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But China's frenzied real estate market is starting to turn optimists into pessimists, who say this sector could be the next big economic bust. The fear is that a collapse of China's property market could hamper global recovery by rocking stock markets and sinking consumer confidence around the world. It also could sharply reduce China's demand for U.S. exports, slowing the growth of the American economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics point to signs that consumer exuberance in China has reached a dangerous level: buyers snapping up luxury properties purely for investment; residential prices rising precipitously across the nation; and vacancy rates soaring for commercial properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pace of ... the housing and property market indicators sort of smack of a bubble to me," says Rachel Ziemba, a Roubini Global Economics senior analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, real estate prices have risen for nine consecutive months in China, making home purchases unaffordable for a growing number of white-collar workers. Among large cities, commercial and residential prices in Shenzhen -- known as much for its wealth as its seemingly boundless growth -- have gained the fastest, rising nearly 21% in the 12-month period ended in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the most dramatic jumps are in Sanya, a resort city in southern China where property prices were nearly 50% higher in February than a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Analysts believe that China's official data likely understate the price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $586 billion government stimulus package helped revive China's economy and the downtrodden real estate market in 2009, but the massive capital injection has raised concerns about asset bubbles. To try to cool the property market, the government has enforced a requirement of a minimum 40% down payment on second homes and reinstated a capital gains tax on homes sold within five years of being purchased. The measures appear to be doing some good: Real estate prices increased in February by a slower rate than the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Vitaliy Katsenelson, research director at Investment Management Associates, warns that there is still a risk that the bursting of the real estate bubble in China could turn the country from a "wind in the sails of the global economy to its anchor."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that happens, China may pull back on its purchase of U.S. dollars, a development that could ripple through the American economy and drive mortgage and auto loan rates higher, says Katsenelson, who has cut his exposure to industrial and energy companies that could be hurt by a downturn in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists warn that a fallout in China's property market could have at least as much of an effect on global economics as the collapse of the U.S. housing market. "China is key to the global economy," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. "If it can lead the (world) out of the recession, it can lead it back in."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gambling on real estate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Shenzhen's Nanshan luxury district, dozens of new residential buildings dominate the landscape alongside outstretched cranes and hulking masses of scaffolding. It'll likely take years before these buildings are teeming with people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But buyers already are bidding up prices in this ritzy part of town, which real estate agents call the "pure luxury property district" because there's plenty of high-end housing but no low-end housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Curio -- one of the most expensive new buildings in the city -- buyers can purchase a nearly 2,400-square-foot apartment for $1.9 million. In the USA, that amount would buy a 2,400-square-foot beach house in Santa Cruz, Calif., a 12-acre New England farm in Sharon, Conn., or a four-bedroom pad near New York City's Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for the Curio, which has expansive views of Shenzhen Bay and the Hong Kong skyline to the south, has been high since sales began last year. All 700 units in the first six buildings were sold before the developer finished construction, mostly to people who want to live in them full time or use them as vacation homes, says Michael Yuk, an agent with Centaline, one of the largest agencies in China. A few hundred more apartments will soon come onto the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another high-end building under construction nearby, named Swire City after a Hong Kong developer known for luxury properties, also is selling quickly, for as much as $1.2 million per apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, even completed buildings in this district are largely vacant, like so many other luxury developments in the city, because buyers aren't moving in. Many are holding onto the property, hoping the value will appreciate. "The demand for Shenzhen property is very strong," says Yuk, "but much of the demand is for the purpose of investment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because most Shenzhen residents are transplants from other parts of China, "people have an attitude of gambling," says Sherman Lai, CEO of Centaline. "They want to make some money and return to where they're from."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gambler's mentality isn't confined to Shenzhen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sanya, a resort city sometimes called the "Hawaii of China," explosive real estate growth has led to questions about whether the property market is a "bubble ready to burst or a natural extension of China's consumer society," says a report from property consultant Crispins Property Investment Management. Many Sanya buyers are wealthy residents from other parts of China, says Marcy Zhang, Crispins general manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in Shanghai's older Puxi area, at the Baccarat -- a posh residential building in one of the busiest commercial districts -- most of the buyers are wealthy people from Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike other luxury buildings in China, which are sold as concrete shells without furnishings, finished walls or floors, the marble-and-jade-accented apartments here come with Baccarat chandeliers, <span class="companylink">B&amp;B Italia</span> furniture and Bang &amp;Olufsen TVs. The apartments, which range from about 900 to 1,600 square feet, cost $1.2 million to $3.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People made a lot of money from stocks in 2006 and 2007, and came and invested" in the building, says Xie Jun Ling, a Shanghai real estate agent, noting that these investors typically already have three to four homes. "The rental market is not that great, so they buy and hold it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for high-end real estate in China often is driven by investors rather than people buying places to live, which means "the pressure is quite big" for a potential price drop, says Michael Wu, China property analyst for Fitch Ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As long as the investment demand dominates the market, the pressure" will remain, Wu says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The danger is that this speculation could create a glut in the residential market, says Michael Harris, investment officer at Gao Fei Consulting Services in Beijing. "If everyone puts their unit up at the same time for sale, there's going to be so much inventory," it could push prices down, and wreak havoc on the property market -- and the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Out of reach'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excess inventory is a problem that already plagues China's commercial property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Shanghai and Guangzhou, the commercial vacancy rate exceeded 15% at the end of 2009. Meanwhile, in Beijing's central business district, the commercial vacancy rate was 29.2%, while the citywide vacancy rate was about 20%, according to real estate broker <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A healthy vacancy rate for Beijing would be around 10%, says Jack Rodman, president of Beijing-based Global Distressed Solutions, a property consultant. But he believes the city's actual commercial vacancy rate is closer to 50%, after taking into account office space that's been completed but isn't on the market. To get back to a normal occupancy rate could take 15 years, he estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Macdonald, head of research at Savills China, an international property adviser, believes some corporations held off expanding or moving to new offices in the first half of 2009 because of the uncertain business environment. But demand for office space picked up in the second half of the year, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Should there be a slight overhang in the market, that will be absorbed," Macdonald says. "If there's an oversupply, the government will start to react."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is how quickly the government can act to fill empty office space and bring residential prices back to earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Shenzhen, rising home prices have priced even agents-cum- potential buyers such as Fiona Liu, with Savills Property Services, out of the real estate market. "The prices are going up a little too fast," Liu says. "They put real estate a little out of reach for ordinary people."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A March World Bank report said it's difficult to determine home affordability -- considered an indicator of whether real estate prices will drop -- partly because of concerns that China's data "underestimate average house price increases and overestimate average wage growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jing Ulrich, chairman of China equities and commodities for <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span>, warns that although home prices are rising rapidly, "such headline figures cannot be viewed in isolation of the broader trend in income growth." From 2003 to 2008, China's per-capita gross national income more than doubled to $2,940, the World Bank says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if rising prices make home buying difficult for some people, that's a "social issue, not a market problem" that points to a real estate bubble, according to Michael Klibaner, head of research at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, a property services firm. The supply of private housing in China is only enough for 20% of the population, he points out, and there are ample buyers in the market who can afford these prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, about one-quarter of all apartments in China are purchased entirely with cash, estimates brokerage firm CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. Even those who borrow money to buy a house are required to pay a 20% to 40% down payment, a CLSA report points out. This contrasts with the USA, where no-documentation and low-down-payment loans fueled the mortgage crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China, "the lending primarily comes through big banks, and it's relatively straightforward," says Chris Brooke, Asia CEO of <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>. "People borrowing against the assets, where the interest rates aren't transparent, those are not issues."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, real estate prices have risen too far, too fast, skeptics say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can't do any kind of rational and fundamental assessment of the market without thinking there's a bubble," Rodman says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales inched down in February, but an approaching deadline for claiming a home buyers' tax credit is still expected to boost spring sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales dipped 0.6% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.02 million from 5.05 million in January, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was still 7% higher than the 4.69 million pace in February 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February's monthly decline in sales was the third in a row and could be due in part to winter storms postponing home closings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some drop-off was expected this winter after a surge late last year ahead of the expiration of a credit for first-time buyers. The current credits, available to first-time and repeat buyers, require buyers to sign purchase contracts by April 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite February's sales dip, many economists expect to see an increase as the April deadline gets closer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We assumed by the end of February we would see the end of the payback from the surge," says Joel Naroff at Naroff Economic Advisors. "Now we have to see what happens in March and April. I would think sales will pick up. I don't think we'll get the pop we got in the fall, but I think we'll get an increase."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total housing inventory at the end of February rose 9.5% to 3.59 million existing homes available for sale. That is an 8.6-month supply at the current sales pace, up from a 7.8-month supply in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More inventory is often considered a sign of a stagnant market and lower housing prices. In this case, Naroff says, it may mean that more homeowners are putting their homes up for sale because they're optimistic that the housing market is turning around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo and co-op sales jumped 4.8% in February, and single-family homes fell 1.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median existing-home price for all types of existing housing was $165,100 in February, which is 1.8% below February 2009. Distressed homes, generally sold at discount, accounted for 35% of sales last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The (report) is not a very good signal overall," says Gregory Daco, an economist at IHS Global Insight. "We're still expecting the tax credit to have an impact in the second quarter, at the end, when people have to close sales. The problem with this month's release is that we continue to see a fall in home sales."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers bought 42% of homes in February, up from 40% in January, according to a separate NAR survey.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOENIX -- Frank McCourt walked into the owner's suite at the Los Angeles Dodgers spring training site last weekend, wearing a crisp pink shirt and gray pants. He plopped on a leather couch, looking tan, relaxed and at peace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last six months have left him weary, emotionally exhausted and embarrassed, with his personal life and details of his crumbling marriage chronicled everywhere from TMZ to the Los Angeles Times to a burgeoning website: DodgerDivorce.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet here at Camelback Ranch, as he watches his club in action during a Cactus League game, he shows no sign of stress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCourt's voice never wavers in his first in-depth interview this spring, showing a resolve that he will not only endure but also prevail through the most turbulent time of his personal life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's tough. I'm not going to lie to you," he says. "It's a very, very sad thing. Nobody wants to go through this privately, never mind publicly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But in L.A., so much of it is about drama. L.A. is so much about personalities. It's just how the city functions. This is a juicy story for people until it's not juicy anymore. Then, they move on to somebody else's story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tiger Woods was fantastic for me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCourt and his wife, Jamie, the club's chief executive officer until her husband fired her, are enduring a "War of the Roses" divorce after 30 years of marriage. Accusations by Frank McCourt of infidelity and outrageous expenditures, and charges of insubordination that led to the firing of Jamie and six Dodgers staffers, have only ramped up the attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamie McCourt, through her public relations staff, declined an interview request from USA TODAY. She made thinly veiled comments about the divorce at a public appearance March 15. In court filings, she claims that her October firing, which came shortly after their separation became public, was part of a plot by her husband to "humiliate and ostracize" her. She says she never had an intimate relationship with her bodyguard until she and Frank separated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while divorces might be as popular as facelifts and tummy tucks in Hollywood, this battle of 56-year-olds is different.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a divorce, Dodgers fans fear, that could ruin their franchise, for which McCourt paid $430 million in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Just the uncertainty of the future and what this divorce is going to do to the team has people very apprehensive," former Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone says. "I think it's a justifiable concern. People don't know if the McCourts will still own the team."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Says Jaime Jarrin, entering his 52nd season as a Dodgers broadcaster, "Frank has been a very good owner, but people in the community worry his personal problems can affect the team."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Diego example</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In court filings, the McCourts estimate legal fees could run as high as $19 million; a trial date is set for May 24. Yet McCourt says his divorce will have no bearing on the team. He points out the Dodgers have the nucleus returning from the team that won the last two National League West titles. For the first time in 31 years, the Dodgers reached the NL Championship Series in consecutive seasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's been an impression created that this is going to have a big impact on the team, when, in fact, it's having no impact," McCourt says. "There's almost a disconnect in what is written and what the reality is. What's important for the fans to know is that it's business as usual here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The team isn't for sale. I'm going to own the team for a long time. And, God willing one day, my four boys will own the team."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dodgers fans are wary, knowing their division foes were hit hard by the divorce of San Diego Padres owners John and Becky Moores. They were forced to sell the club, and the Padres are projected to open the season with a major league-low $40 million payroll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When somebody mentions divorce," McCourt says, "you think California. Community property state. Sports franchise. And then you throw in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But we have marital property agreements that deal specifically with this situation, and that was not the case in San Diego. This has had an impact on our personal life, and it's sad personally, but it has no impact on the ownership and operations of the Dodgers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is not San Diego."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple entered into a postnuptial agreement in March 2004, according to court records, showing that McCourt is sole owner of the team. Jamie was left custody of their personal property and eight homes, including neighboring homes in Malibu and Holmby Hills valued at $72.5 million. The agreement was made to protect Jamie's real estate and investments from any creditors' claim that might result from purchasing the Dodgers, according to documents filed by Frank McCourt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bert Fields, one of Jamie McCourt's attorneys, reiterated Monday that his client believes she is entitled to half the team, valued last year by Forbes at more than $700 million, because the postnuptial agreement was never designed to give Frank McCourt full ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mr. McCourt is ducking the issue," Fields says. "He thinks he's going to get ownership of the Dodgers and 95% of the assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They agreed to be 50-50 (owners). And she doesn't want to sell. She loves baseball. She has the ability to buy out Frank if he wants. If he doesn't want to sell, they'll have to figure out a way to run the team together."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big payroll drop since '08</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the divorce indeed has no bearing on the club's operations, critics suggest, how to explain the Dodgers' shrinking payroll? It was $118 million in 2008. This year, without deferred payments, it will be about $83 million -- about $12 million less than the rival San Francisco Giants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Forbes, the Dodgers' annual revenue are about $241 million, compared with the Giants' $196 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decreasing payroll is starting to resurrect fan concerns from when McCourt bought the team from Fox. The McCourts originally tried to buy the Boston Red Sox. When they bought the Dodgers, the perception was that they were underfinanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCourt says the Dodgers simply are being prudent and that the divorce isn't affecting any decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are lying to the public," says Los Angeles radio talk show host Joe McDonnell, a broadcaster for 34 years. "You don't go from a payroll of $110 million to $80 million and say the divorce has got nothing to do with it. How they can have a payroll less than the Minnesota Twins is a ... joke. These fans aren't idiots. But they're insulting their intelligence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamie McCourt accuses her husband of lying about his net wealth, with Fields saying McCourt is worth about $2 billion, and not $163 million as McCourt declares in court filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is requesting $989,000 a month in living expenses, listing monthly maintenance of $568,829 for their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also is seeking benefits such as private jet travel, accommodations at five-star hotels, security escorts when traveling, house calls from her makeup artist and hair stylists, use of the Dodgers owners suite, and tickets to all NL and playoff games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know what's happening," says Steve Douma, 45, a Dodgers fan from Norwalk, Calif., as he watched an exhibition game here. "They raised the parking prices. The ticket prices have gone up, too. If this divorce gets ugly and nasty, he may have to sell the team. I don't know what he has in his side or back pockets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No distraction, players say</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Players say divorce details are of little concern in the clubhouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We ain't got nothing to do with all of that," says Dodgers center fielder Matt Kemp, who also found himself in the news by dating singer Rihanna. "Things happen. We're just here to play baseball."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dodgers manager Joe Torre, who's entering the final year of his contract and halted his extension negotiations to assure there's no further distraction, says he won't let it become a disruption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I never tell players not to say things," says Torre, who remains friends with both McCourts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What I did tell them was that we're here to play. You're going to be asked questions. Answer them any way you want, but our job is to get ready to play a season."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dodgers, considered at least co-favorites with the Colorado Rockies to win the NL West, trimmed their payroll by trading outfielder Juan Pierre to the Chicago White Sox, saving $8 million, and permitting free agents Randy Wolf (who earned $8 million in 2009) and second baseman Orlando Hudson ($3.38 million) to leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oft-injured starter Jason Schmidt's three-year, $47 million contract also expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dodgers general manager Ned Colletti, hired in November 2005 after McCourt fired Paul DePodesta, notes none of the players figured into the club's 2010 plans and that they promised Pierre they would trade him to a team where he could be a regular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dodgers still brought back every salary-arbitration player and gave two-year deals to Kemp, first baseman James Loney and closer Jonathan Broxton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their vaunted bullpen, led by Broxton, remains intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And though they don't have a bona fide fifth starter, just how many teams really do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Dodgers don't win, it's on them, Colletti said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I told them you're going to hear a lot of noise from the outside," Colletti says, "but it has nothing to do with what we do on the inside."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCourt says the club won't be hindered if it again wants to augment at the July 31 trade deadline as it did in 2008 with slugger Manny Ramirez.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've tried to make promises to the fans and community that can be measured," McCourt says. "It's no longer, 'Let's hope to make the playoffs.' It's that we expect to make the playoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Evidence of the ground we gained the last six years: We seem to be mentioned more and more in the same conversations with the Yankees and Red Sox.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our mission is to win the world championship, too. And we're 100% committed to doing that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I know how people like drama, but ironically, there's just not a lot of drama with this team. Everything is very stable and quiet here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Really, it couldn't be better."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Michigan cities of Ann Arbor and Detroit are only about 40 miles apart, but the distance is enough to present starkly different housing markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ann Arbor market saw the boom and bust in recent years. But first-time home buyer tax credits in 2009 helped change fortunes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's almost like we started fresh this year," says Alex Milshteyn, president of the Ann Arbor Area Board of Realtors. "For the first time, I have buyers who are in the market (who) can't find what they are looking for."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In January, the Ann Arbor area's home sales were 7.9% higher than in January 2009. Compare that with Detroit, home to the auto industry, where sales in January were down 53.0% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ann Arbor is home to the University of Michigan, and that helped prop up the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We didn't go down as far as the rest of the state because Ann Arbor is a transient community," Milshteyn says. "The majority of people come and go. The university draws them in."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. In January, the Ann Arbor area's median sales price was 4.4% lower than a year earlier. That was mostly pulled down by first-time home buyers, who are generally buying homes from $120,000 to $200,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not many homeowners are taking advantage of the $6,500 tax credit to move up in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The reality is that $6,500 isn't going to help their loss," Milshteyn says. "If they bought a home at the peak of the market, their home is now more than $6,500 upside down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. The area traditionally has had the state's strongest regional economy. In addition to the University of Michigan, the city is close to Eastern Michigan University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The area has always had a very diverse industry mix," says Mark Reffitt, regional economic analyst at Michigan's Department of Energy, Labor &amp;Economic Growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean the area has been able to skirt the recession. In 2000, Ann Arbor's unemployment rate was 2%. In December of last year, the rate was up to 9%. "It has been pretty hard hit," Reffitt says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. The drop in prices has made some popular neighborhoods more affordable. Even the Old West Side, a historic area of tree-lined streets, parks and waterways, is a possibility for first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are as low as $150,000, Milshteyn says. At the market's peak, the lowest price in the neighborhood was about $350,000, and those homes would have been fixer-uppers. The neighborhood has an eclectic mix of homes. Most date from 1850 to 1925.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many home buyers work at the university or at downtown businesses, because both are in walking distance.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An increasing number of developers struggling to find older residents for their 55-plus housing communities have relaxed the age restrictions to attract younger home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing collapse and recession hurt sales in active adult communities, which in the past 10 years had multiplied as the first wave of 79 million Baby Boomers entered retirement. The real estate boom allowed retirees to make big bucks on their old homes and pay cash for smaller houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The 50-plus buyer has had a double whammy in the last couple of years," says Brian Gentry, president of Landed Gentry Homes and Communities, based in Burlington, Wash. "They lost the ability to turn their house into cash, and a lot of them have taken a pretty big hit in their portfolios."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company found more success with multigenerational developments, he says. It built enclaves for younger adults in a Mount Vernon development initially aimed at older buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent age-restriction changes include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Somerset Development was building 173 homes for older adults at Pine River Village in Lakewood, N.J., when the market tanked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We started right as the market was cooling off, sold about 20 homes, and the market just died," says Ralph Zucker, Somerset president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went to the 26 residents at the time for approval and then to Lakewood Township officials for a zoning change. Now, about half of the homes will be for all ages in a separate development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sherwood Lakes in Virginia Beach was going to build a third of 180 homes for 55-plus buyers. "As we were building, we realized the market for age-restricted was almost non-existent," says Dustin Little, sales consultant for Sherwood Lakes and a real estate agent. "We went to the City Council and lifted the age restriction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sun City Grand in Surprise, Ariz., was completed in late 2005. Two years later, the community voted to allow people ages 45 to 54 in 15% of the homes. That lets children who inherit the homes move in after the owners die. "We had forward-thinking board members who could see the future," says Meda Cates, membership director. "As we age, we golf less, we spend less money doing activities, and we also wanted to be perceived as a younger community."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elazer and Barbara Lew were the first to move in to Pine River Village in Lakewood, N.J., a development for people ages 55 and older.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I liked the idea of moving to an adult community, with all the services and amenities," says Barbara, 63, who works at a nearby school for children with special needs. "I liked the idea of having people our own age to socialize with."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was three years ago -- just before the housing market crashed and the recession hit. Suddenly, older buyers who had wanted to enjoy the amenities that age-restricted communities offer couldn't sell their homes. On top of that, their retirement funds were taking a beating as stock prices plummeted. Some who had planned to retire and move decided to stay put and keep working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 20 Pine River Village homes had sold when the developer approached the homeowners with a proposal: agree to lift the age restriction on housing built on half of the development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were mixed feelings," says Ronald Gray, 65, who was among the first to buy in to Pine River with his wife, Rachel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somerset Development vowed to keep the new phase completely separate. It even has a different name: Somerset Walk. Residents have their own clubhouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lifting or easing age restrictions in active-adult communities is the latest consequence of the recession and housing collapse -- especially in new developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey, which has a 16-year supply of age-restricted housing, is at the forefront of this movement. The state's towns and counties welcomed no-kids housing with gusto because the developments created revenue without putting a strain on local school budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They used that tool too often -- to excess," says Robert Lang, urban sociologist at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. "It was overstocked because it was easy to get approved."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ralph Zucker, whose company is building Pine River and Somerset Walk, said many developers "pushed back on regular development because it was a lot easier to do age-restricted communities. ... Now, we see an active market for non-restricted housing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, New Jersey passed a law that allows developers to ask municipalities to do away with age limits on projects that have already been approved. More affordable housing would be built in return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Struggling developers see non-restricted building as a way to tap a larger market, including first-time home buyers. Residents accept it because they would rather live in a built community than be surrounded by dirt lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can't get our streets paved the way we'd like to because development hasn't been finished," Barbara Lew says. Opening it up to families could attract new business. "We still have our separate development; we'll still be just in our section," she says. "I see it as a good alternative to just sitting and waiting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gray, who runs a foundation for disadvantaged children, says, "In the final analysis, we realized it was in our best interest. We felt we'd rather live in a community than in a construction zone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes also may satisfy older residents' desire to be close to their children and grandchildren by creating a multigenerational community, Zucker says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lews, who lived in Staten Island, N.Y., for 31 years, have two daughters who live in Lakewood. "For people to have their children buy on the other side is a very good idea, especially as people get older," Barbara Lew says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large retirement communities are still thriving, says Dan Owens of the National Active Retirement Association, a trade group involved in marketing and building for people older than 50. He predicts that when the economy improves, the market will get a big boost because of pent-up demand. "Even though some communities are drifting away from age restrictions, you can't ignore the demographics," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More home buyers are snapping up properties with cash, a trend driven in large part by investors returning to the market after four years of falling prices around the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of home sales involving all-cash transactions was 26% in January, up from 18% a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. The figures come from a survey of members about their most recent transactions. Many home buyers also are paying cash, but investors are largely using cash so they can avoid paying interest charges on loans and get a larger return on their investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other NAR data also show a pickup in investment activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home purchases made by buyers identified as investors climbed to 17% in January, up from 15% in December and 12% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We bottomed out in 2008, and in late 2009, prices stabilized and investors have returned," says Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American CoreLogic. "It's a different type of investor going after foreclosed properties and expecting to hold on for longer time frames."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors say they're financing their purchases with cash on hand, rather than borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evan Spinrod of San Francisco bought three rental properties in November and February and now owns 21 in four states. The rent he collects gives him an 8.5% annual return on his investment. Some of his homes are worth about $165,000. "I'm still looking," Spinrod says. "You can't build these houses for the prices they're selling them. I've always seen that the real wealth was in real estate. People have been sitting on cash, and there's no interest from the bank (to pay)."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leonard Baron, a real estate professor at San Diego State University, has bought three homes with cash in the San Diego area in the past eight months, ranging in price from $100,000 to $130,000. He rents the properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baron says now is an ideal time to make such purchases. "It's because prices have dropped so much and rents really haven't," he says. "The deals were unbelievable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Realtors also say they're seeing increased investor activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Flippers, rehabbers, investors ... are, in fact, buying," says Lisa Johnson, with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Haverhill, Mass. "I'm getting builders who have stopped building and are instead buying up condos and single-family homes to fix them up and sell them. It's a neat change I haven't seen in four years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All-cash purchases also reflect a growing number of investors buying higher-end properties without credit, says NAR spokesman Walter Molony. That's a sign that some investors see real estate prices as having nowhere to go but up. All-cash offers give buyers a competitive edge on rival offers -- even higher ones -- that are dependent on financing. Cash deals can close faster and are less likely to fall through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have to have cash to be able to close quickly and have negotiating power. Cash is king," says Tanya Marchiol, president of Phoenix-based Team Investments, which buys about 70 properties a month with cash it raises from investors. "We do want to flip it or generate cash flow (through renting it out). Now is the time to buy for cash flow. We know the market is going to rebound."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors say the current real estate market is an ideal time to buy because homes are so low priced, they are bound to hold their value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the philosophy of Jim McClelland of Tinley Park, Ill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is buying about 120 to 150 entry-level homes in the Chicago area this year and owns a total of about 300 properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says now is a good time to buy because properties going into foreclosure are no longer just one-bedroom, fixer-uppers but nicer, split-level brick homes with more bedrooms that will probably appreciate to a higher value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because so many prime-rate borrowers who bought more expensive homes have gone into foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He puts about $60,000 into upgrading a property, then rents it out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Do I think this year will be a better time to invest than in 2009? Yes," McClelland says. "There have always been foreclosures. The difference now is you get a better home for the same kind of money. You're sitting on better inventory. People get into real estate for financial independence. It's not a quick fix. It appreciates. It doesn't happen overnight."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the home rented by the Munar family, at left, Baron, a San Diego State University real estate professor, also owns these homes in Chula Vista, Calif. They're all in the same neighborhood, so they have a similar appearance.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUSTIN -- While masses crammed the South by Southwest Interactive tech show over the weekend, a spacious home on the east side of town housed a thriving new techie trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Co-working" businesses, like Conjunctured here, offer homey environs for people to work, brainstorm and drink as much free coffee as they like. Conjunctured's 22 members pay a monthly fee of $250.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept is not new. Such facilities surfaced a couple years ago, but they are thriving because the economy has forced companies and non-profits to use them as a practical way to save money. They are especially appealing to one-person businesses, which grew 8% in 2008, the most recent year for which data are available, according to the Small Business Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a rise in vacancies, office rentals remain pricey, at $27.80 per square foot nationally, says Reis, a New York firm that tracks commercial property. Co-working services are sprouting in Austin, San Francisco, Boston and New York. There's even a business district in Paris that is a hub to such spots. There are dozens of such businesses popping up in the U.S., says David Walker, co- founder of Conjunctured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Who can afford office space?" says Natalie Petouhoff, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Forrester Research</span>. Satellite offices, she says, have displaced coffee houses, bookstores and libraries to study or work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where: Meet, Mix, Mogul, an open-loft space in Los Angeles run by Danielle Nicoli, has become a fashionable destination for writers, start-ups, sales people and non-profits. It's also home to a weekly cooking class. Customers can pay monthly or per use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a new thing for entrepreneurs," says Nicoli, who noted several co-working businesses are coming to Los Angeles. "It signals a socialized and economic shift in how people do work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many freelancers need nothing more than a Wi-Fi connection, but some independent contractors or people who work remotely want to bounce their ideas off others. A new study of 3,600 telecommuters commissioned by <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> revealed their No. 1 complaint was lack of face-to-face interaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our biggest selling point is as a community," says Daria Siegel, director of Hive at 55 in New York. Since it opened in December, more than 50 people have become regular members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Graphic designer Brad Istre has collaborated on several website projects with people he's met as a member of Conjunctured. Another half-dozen places are about to open in Austin.</p>

</div><div class="author">Christine Dugas </div><div>598 words</div><div>16 March 2010</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.2</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home buyer tax credit helped thaw a frigid start to the St. Cloud, Minn., housing market this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first 10 days of the year came in at 3.1 degrees below zero on average, but the home buyer tax credit got people out of their homes and into the market, pulling up what could have been a disaster of a month to only a slight decline year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Before, it was difficult to get a buyer to make a decision," says Cory Ehlert, president of St. Cloud Area Association of Realtors. "They didn't see any reason to rush ahead, because there was plenty of inventory and they thought that prices would go down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the $8,000 and $6,500 credits for buyers pushed sales through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In January, St. Cloud's home sales were 5.6% lower than the same month in 2009, but that's not as bad as it may seem: The 34 sales trailed those last January by only two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. The median sales price increased 3.1% from a year earlier. But home prices in St. Cloud seldom have experienced dramatic highs and lows. "That's because we have modest, hardworking people, and I don't think that there ever was a big trend to keep up with the Joneses," Ehlert says. The best-selling price range is $100,000 to $175,000, Ehlert says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. St. Cloud's unemployment rate was 7.4% in January, which matched the state's rate. It is a college town, and that helps employment remain steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Thanks to the university, we have a fair share of state and local government employment," says King Banaian, chairman of the economics department at St. Cloud State University. "And we still have some employment in the transportation sector."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the St. Cloud area also relies on retailing and manufacturing, and those jobs have been hit hard. "And a lot of construction work around here is moribund," Banaian says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. This Old House magazine recently added St. Cloud to its annual list of the best places to buy an old house. The city's Victorian-era homes can start at $100,000 and go up to $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">St. Cloud has long sought preservation of historic homes. The city is working on revitalizing the South Side University neighborhood. Over the years, the older homes had become student housing rentals, but now many are being renovated and turned back into owner-occupied homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The buyers are a mix between those working downtown and at the university," says Matt Glaesman, St. Cloud's community development director. "People are looking for the vitality of downtown life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coming next week: Ann Arbor, Mich.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction ran 3/10/2010: The Close to Home feature Tuesday listed an incorrect county for Knoxville, Tenn. It is in Knox County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market in Knoxville, Tenn., has weathered recent storms: those that dropped snow throughout the winter, and those economic in nature that have battered much of the nation's housing market. Sales in the state's third-largest city are off to a good start this year after 2009 sales fell below 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It seems to be picking up," says Barry Hensley, past president of the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors. "It's odd, because it will get red hot and then slow down a little, and then get red hot again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In January, Knoxville County home sales were 12.2% higher than in January 2009. The home buyer tax credit seems to be sparking more sales. In order to take advantage of it, buyers must have a binding contract by April 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers are mostly looking for properties priced at $150,000 or less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Over the years, home prices stabilized. In January, the median sales price was up 6.1% from a year earlier. Even last year, when home sales were down, prices remained stable, Hensley says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Knoxville's unemployment rate was 8.7% in December, lower than the state rate of 10.7%. "We generally have a favorable economic climate here," says Matt Murray, economist at the University of Tennessee. The employment base includes the University of Tennessee, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the <span class="companylink">Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, operator of the dams, lock and reservoirs of the Tennessee River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not seeing big layoffs," Murray says. "We're not seeing the visible plant closings, and we're seeing activity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that doesn't mean that the recession and national news are not having a negative impact on home sales. "I think fear is causing people to pull in their horns a little and wait to see what happens," Hensley says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Fourth &amp;Gill is a historic neighborhood that fell into neglect in the last century. "It's an urban pioneer neighborhood," says Suzy Trotta, a real estate agent at Coldwell Banker Wallace &amp;Wallace. "It's reclaiming its former glory," she says, but it's still a work in progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queen Anne and Craftsman-style homes date from the 1880s to the 1940s. The walkable neighborhood is close to downtown and a public park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers can get good deals if they are willing to rehab a distressed home, Trotta says. Prices can go up to $899,000, but one renovated two-bedroom bungalow built in 1920 is priced at just $119,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median-price home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This home, built in 2007, is on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price: $129,900.</p>

</div><div class="author">Christine Dugas </div><div>614 words</div><div>2 March 2010</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.5</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Punta Gorda, Fla., like other cities in the Sun Belt, is still suffering from a housing hangover. But lower prices are finally bringing buyers into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market correction was the healthiest thing that could happen," says Bob Gray, president of Punta Gorda-Port Charlotte- North Port Association of Realtors. "We have come out of the nose dive and leveled out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bursting of the housing bubble was especially painful in Punta Gorda, which is about midway between Sarasota and Fort Myers. Housing prices had skyrocketed in the building boom that followed Hurricane Charley, which wiped out much of the housing inventory in 2004. The eventual drop in prices was steep. "We got a double whammy," Gray says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. The market has stabilized. In January, Punta Gorda home sales were 12% higher than the same month in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People have started to realize that now is the time to grab something, because you can buy a nice house for as little as $100,000 with a pool," Gray says. Punta Gorda, which has waterfront properties, golf and sailboat access, is more affordable than other retiree areas in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Home prices are rising. That might indicate that foreclosures have hit bottom and are no longer a drain on home values. In January, Punta Gorda's median sales price increased 2.6% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There has been some evidence that the rate of foreclosure is slowing," says Sean Snaith, economics professor at the University of Central Florida. But job losses and the recession could still drag more homeowners into foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Punta Gorda's unemployment rate was 13% in December, higher than the state's 11.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of its employment is related to construction and tourism. Some of those jobs disappeared as home buying by retirees stalled. "The influx of retirees has been choked off by the recession, the crisis of the financial markets and the state of the housing markets," Snaith says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Punta Gorda's housing market did not get much of a boost from the first-time home buyer tax credit because of rising unemployment, Gray says. "It can be the best deal in the world. But if you don't have a good job or don't have enough income to support a mortgage, nobody is going to lend you money," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Punta Gorda Isles is a sailboat, waterfront community with an eclectic mix of homes and reasonable prices. It has biking paths, parks and restaurants, Gray says. And it is close to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are now roughly half of what they were at the peak. One waterfront property with three bedrooms and a swimming pool is priced at $199,900.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose in December for the seventh month in a row, but more foreclosures are expected to pull down prices later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seasonally adjusted home prices in 20 major metro areas rose 0.3% in December compared with November, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller Home Price Index. Fourteen cities showed higher prices than in November on a seasonally adjusted basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But compared with 2008, prices were still lower in 15 of the 20 cities. Las Vegas, down 20.6% in 2009, had the worst decline. San Francisco had the biggest increase in prices: 4.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, average home prices in the fourth quarter were similar to what they were in 2003, the report showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Generally, 2009 was better than 2008, but we're not out of the woods yet," says Maureen Maitland of <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller report Tuesday noted that many metro areas are no longer showing the same rate of improvement they were last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices are showing signs of stabilizing, some economists warn that they could slide again once a tax credit for first-time home buyers expires in spring. Buyers must sign a purchase contract by April 30 to get the credit. Demand for entry-level homes is expected to drop off after that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another worry is that more homeowners with negative equity -- owing more than their homes are worth -- will walk away from mortgages in what's known as a strategic default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increased defaults could trigger more foreclosures that further depress prices. More than 11.3 million homes with mortgages, or 24%, had negative equity at the end of 2009, First American CoreLogic reported Tuesday. That's up from 10.7 million, or 23%, at the end of the third quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't know how big a problem strategic defaults are going to be," says Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight. "Even though prices have stabilized, it's temporary, and prices will start dropping again, another 5% to 10%."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not seeing the price pressure we'd seen in the past 18 months," says Pat Lashinsky, CEO of ZipRealty. "I think there'll be an uptick (in prices) in a few months, and then some downward pressures as the tax credit expires. But prices are stabilizing. There is so much less supply now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a 7.2-month supply of existing homes available in December, up from 6.5 months in November, according to the National Association of Realtors. The inventory exceeded a nine months supply for most of 2009.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buffalo has endured tough economic times, but its housing market dodged the worst of the housing bubble. It recently earned accolades, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the Local Market Monitor, a North Carolina-based real estate research firm, named the county seat of Erie County one of the top 10 large housing markets because of its stability and growth potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buffalo also received national attention when the TV show Extreme Makeover: Home Edition aired a special two-hour episode last month about a west-side neighborhood. More than 5,000 volunteers helped build a home, improve the exteriors of other homes and plant community gardens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the state-sponsored Sustainable Neighborhoods Project picked Buffalo as the place to revitalize 23,000 vacant housing units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The city is coming back," says Phil Aquila, president of the Western New York MLS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Positive news has not equated to steady sales. In December, Erie County home sales were 10.3% lower than in December 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New, tighter lending rules and more complicated home appraisals can be blamed, says Bobbie Kagle, president of Buffalo Niagara Association of Realtors. Many first-time home buyers rushed to buy a home before the federal tax credit's original deadline in November, which slowed year-end sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Buffalo never experienced a surge in foreclosures, and its market has remained relatively stable. In December, Erie County's median sales price increased 10.7% from a year earlier. But the price was nearly the same as it had been in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. The Buffalo-Niagara Falls unemployment rate was 8.5% in December, lower than the state's and the nation's. And it has had nominal job gains in the education and health services and professional and business sectors, according to Local Market Monitor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buffalo hasn't fully recovered from the 2001 recession, says George Palumbo, economics professor at Canisius College. And employment growth has been in the lower-paid service sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Elmwood Village attracts many first-time home buyers. The neighborhood features many boutiques, restaurants and cafes, and has a farmers' market. It is also one of Buffalo's oldest residential areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices can be less than $100,000. One such home, built in 1827, is priced at $64,900 and is described as an updated charming Victorian cottage.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the mountains, to the prairies, to the oceans white with foam, the search for jobs in America is as varied and diverse as the nation's geography.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. unemployment rate was 9.7% in January. But that big number blurs what's happening in hundreds of local economies -- some winners, some losers -- as a result of the harsh, job-destroying recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's 372 metropolitan areas are experiencing an extraordinary range of jobless rates -- from a low of 4% in Grand Forks, N.D., to a high of 27.7% in El Centro, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The simplest explanation may be the most telling: The bigger the housing bubble, the worse the job loss. That's still true more than two years after the housing bubble burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So much employment growth was tied to construction that states that had the biggest boom -- California, Florida, Arizona, Nevada -- have suffered the worst job loss," says economist Gus Faucher of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The middle of the country -- from Texas to North Dakota -- missed most of the real estate growth and, to a large extent, the comedown. "These (middle of the nation) economies are less cyclical and less exposed to the nation's business cycle," Faucher says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">College towns and state capitals also have enjoyed an extra degree of stability, keeping unemployment low in some places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand why some places are winning and others losing, USA TODAY examined a pair of No. 2s -- the metropolitan areas of Lincoln, Neb., which has the second-lowest metro area unemployment rate in the United States, and Merced, Calif., which has the second- highest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lincoln symbolizes a swath of the central USA with economies that didn't have wild highs and lows during the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merced represents the opposite. Here are their stories:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lincoln: Steady as she goes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lincoln's economy has been good for so long that it's hard for many there to remember bad times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate in the vibrant metropolitan area of 296,000 is just 4.1%, second-lowest in the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate has never been above 5% since the Bureau of Labor Statistics starting tracking it 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like we're on our own island out here," says Jason Perry, a Wisconsin-born rental car manager who moved to Nebraska in 2008, when his wife, Robin, got a job in nearby Omaha, which also has low unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lincoln is home to a major research university and national and regional headquarters for several substantial companies. It is surrounded by farms that export worldwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The metro area -- built on the edge of the Great Plains -- has the good fortune of being at the convergence of several positive trends in a dangerously weak national economy. Lincoln is:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*A college town, home to 24,000 students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Nine of the 10 metro areas with the lowest unemployment rates have major universities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*A state capital, benefiting from a stable workforce of government jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Part of a farm economy at a time when farm income has been at or near record highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as important, Lincoln missed the real estate bubble, so it's not suffering withdrawal from a construction boom caused by too- easy credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Henning, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Assurity Life Insurance</span> of Lincoln, can't recall any significant speculative office buildings or shopping centers getting built in Lincoln during this decade's national real estate boom that ended in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During an interview, Henning calls the company's head of real estate lending on a speaker phone to check his memory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment chief Bill Schmeeckle pauses for a long time as he recalls what's been built in Lincoln during the past several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No. None," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henning says a real estate developer who approached <span class="companylink">Assurity Life</span> about financing a speculative building would have been met with the common-sense question: "You mean you want to build it, but you don't have any tenants yet?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction in Lincoln proceeded at a steady, moderate pace during the last decade -- and that continues today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Assurity Life</span> is building a new $53 million corporate headquarters. The university is developing a new research park. In May, voters will decide whether to approve bonds to start a $334 million arena for the university's basketball team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's historic Haymarket District continues to slowly but steadily add new businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bar &amp;Grill has hung a sign at its future location: "Now Accepting Applications for All Positions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trent Taylor, 28, who recently quit his job as a cook, says he's not worried about finding work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's work around, just not always what you want," says Taylor, smoking a cigarette outside a government career center in downtown Lincoln.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lincoln hasn't been immune to the recession. A total of 6,800 people were unemployed in December in a labor force of 167,000. That's an increase of 1,150 from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've absolutely had job losses," says Eric Thompson, a University of Nebraska economist. "It just doesn't feel like the worst recession in 30 years or longer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason: Nebraska has among the nation's highest rates of people holding multiple jobs, Thompson says. That means people can lose one job or be employed below their skill level, yet not count as unemployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nebraska, with its high level of education, and Lincoln, in particular, have a labor force that's attractive to employers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We might have someone with an economics degree working as a clerk," Henning says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lincoln's diversified economy has more than 100 companies and agencies that employ 250 or more workers, including a robust manufacturing sector. Kawasaki makes New York subway cars here, along with all-terrain vehicles and Jet Skis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick Cusick, chief executive of IMS Corp., says manufacturing has been helped by electricity rates 25% below the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key reason for the low rates: Nebraska is the only state that generates all its power from government-owned utilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thriving entrepreneurship and the lack of a major union presence also have helped keep Nebraska manufacturers competitive, says Cusick, who started his company with a high school buddy in 1974.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Cusick and his friend are still 50-50 partners in a company that employs 200, down from a peak of 275 in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IMS makes football goalposts, basketball hoops and electronic signs and scoreboards. The PGA Tour's electronic leader board is one of its products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cusick thinks his region's "common sense" culture helps Lincoln avoid economic peaks and valleys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nebraska companies typically are reluctant to take on debt because of this conservative culture, he says. Nebraska's Constitution even prohibits the state from borrowing money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Nebraska sensibility -- whether it's in the public sector or the private sector -- is to be cautious," Cusick says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cusick vacations in Scottsdale, Ariz., every March and November. Between visits there, new shopping centers would appear there during the boom years. "Lot of vacancies now," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lincoln was different that way. No boom, no bust. Still hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merced: 'Like a bomb went off'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Merced, a stroll down Main Street brings little visible evidence of the economic misery that grips the San Joaquin Valley city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drive a few miles to the outskirts, though, and the pain comes into focus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the big Bellevue Ranch subdivision, entire cul-de-sacs look like eerie ghost towns, empty of people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rows of homes stand unfinished, their bare wood frames darkened by rain and weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unopened roll of roofing paper rests atop one house, and the clutter of construction debris lies soaked from winter rains, untouched since buyers and workers walked away when the housing bubble burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was like a bomb went off," says Tom Calton, a retired insurance executive who devotes his time to helping the newly poor through an outreach program at his church, Liberty Fellowship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The workers walked away. It happened so quick it was scary. It put people in shock. ... It didn't slow down. It just collapsed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the Merced metropolitan area (population 246,117) has the second-highest unemployment rate in the nation, 19.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merced also has one of the highest foreclosure rates. According to widely published statistics from First American CoreLogic, one in five homes in Merced County were 90 days' delinquent in payments as of November 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact on property values has been devastating. Home values have dropped 62% since 2006, city spokesman Mike Conway says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices dropped from a peak of $337,300 in 2006 to $94,300 at the end of 2009, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, which tracks real estate values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities here in California's fruit and vegetable basket are always dependent on the vagaries of agriculture and see unemployment soar in winter when there's little work in the fields. In this recession, however, the impact has been compounded by the collapse of construction after a frenzied speculative bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, the city issued 1,444 residential building permits, Conway notes. In 2009, the number was seven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapse of construction has been devastating for Jerry Manning, 48, who made his living designing and selling home kitchens -- countertops, cabinets and appliances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He worked for several construction supply companies and had his own company but saw demand vanish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The way the economy went, I just couldn't get any work," says Manning, who has a wife and two teenage sons. "No houses are getting built, and people aren't doing a lot of remodeling."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manning and his wife gave up the 2005 car they were making payments on, canceled cable TV and accepted the gift of a 16-year- old car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They live in a rented home and have exhausted their savings, he says. His wife gets a few hours of work each week preparing food for the school system, and he works as a volunteer with Calton's church group, Nineveh Outreach, distributing food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the first time I've ever not been able to get a job," Manning said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've e-mailed and filled out applications and all that stuff. Nothing. I'm not getting any return calls. Nothing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout inland California, the lure of lower property and construction prices compared with expensive coastal areas brought a building boom during the early and mid-2000s. Easy money from lenders allowed people to buy bigger homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Merced, the frenzy had still more fuel -- the arrival in 2005 of the University of California-Merced, the latest campus in the prestigious UC system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders put up houses with confidence that the arrival of more students and faculty would provide people to live in them, says Shawn Kantor, economics professor at the young campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the availability of mortgage capital, there was just incredible building going on," Kantor says. "When I moved here in 2004, there was new development popping up just on the outskirts of town. You kind of wondered, where were all these people going to come from?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university one day will enroll 25,000 students, its projections show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, however, there are fewer than 3,500 students. It will take decades for the young school to reach its enrollment potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a relatively speaking poor area, with high unemployment and perpetual poverty," Kantor says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's not a strong high-tech industry, not a huge manufacturing sector here. So to a large extent it is agriculture and low-level services that are driving the economy. ... If any area was going to fall apart as a result of interest rates going up and house prices falling, it's going to be especially exaggerated in this area, where people had a hard time qualifying for loans in the first place."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Salvation Army, Capt. Joel Harmon and his volunteers serve a free breakfast every morning and dinner on Saturday night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 200 people show up each day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those who show up for a hot meal are homeless. Others are families straining to stay above water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angela Rodriguez, 41, comes each morning along with her daughter, Kimberly Hinojosa, 22, and Hinojosa's two sons, Aliza, 3, and Jayden, 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rodriguez's husband is a farm laborer, and in winter things are slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rodriguez was laid off from her job as an adult care nurse nearly 50 or so miles away in Fresno. She has been unable to find another job and is struggling to meet this month's rent of $575.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We make rice and beans. That's all we eat, and some corn tortillas," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I need a job really bad."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rodriguez is considering her fallback: living in their old Chevrolet Blazer SUV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there are some glimmers of hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Bill Spriggs points to plans for a <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> distribution center in Merced that will bring jobs, and a few small businesses have opened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're kind of bouncing along the bottom with a little increase," Spriggs says. "I think we're in for a couple years of it, but there are bright things on the horizon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those bright spots is Jerry Yang, 42, who recently opened a sushi and tappanyaki restaurant in Merced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yang had capital to invest after winning more than $8 million at the 2007 World Series of Poker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A clinical psychologist before televised poker made him a multimillionaire, Yang invested $350,000 in opening Pocket 8's Sushi &amp;Grill, which has 26 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is doing well, he says, and he is thinking of adding new locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of business people I know are afraid to invest," Yang says. "To me, I'm thinking the opposite -- the best time to buy a house is when the market is down, and business is the same thing. ... That's when you take your shot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I still see a good future for Merced," Yang says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The people of Merced will get through this."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- Like the Oscars, Sunset Boulevard and Grauman's Chinese Theatre, the hillside sign spelling out "Hollywood" is an icon of cinema, celebrity and this city itself. But the postcard view could be in danger from developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservationists say they have two months to seize an opportunity -- and raise $12.5 million -- to buy the land adjacent to the sign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be horrible if that view was molested," says Tom LaBonge, a Los Angeles city councilman who represents the area. "This is our iconic symbol."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LaBonge, a Democrat, and the Trust for Public Land said Tuesday that they have raised about $8 million of what is needed, with half of that from public funds dedicated for park lands. They want to buy 138 acres behind and to the left of the sign and add it to Griffith Park, which lies to the east of the sign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their option to purchase expires April 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless the land is protected, they say, the current private owners could move forward to build mansions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paige Rausser, project manager for the San Francisco-based preservation group, said $1 million was raised since it kicked off a campaign last week. For five days ending Tuesday, the group draped the 45-foot-tall letters that spell out "Hollywood" with a temporary new message: "Save the Peak."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sign was put up in 1923 as an ad for a housing project, Hollywoodland, of former Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler. The shortened version later became one of the most famous signs of all time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It faces southward along a 1,865-foot mountain ridge that separates Hollywood and much of Los Angeles from the San Fernando Valley to the north.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 138-acre tract on Cahuenga Peak was put on the market in 2002 by the estate of Howard Hughes, who had owned it since 1940.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hughes, the famed industrialist and aviator, had wanted to build an estate on the property for his intended bride, actress Ginger Rogers. Those plans died with their relationship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyers, a Chicago investment group, secured rights to build several estates, Rausser said. The subdivided property was offered for sale in 2008 for $22 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efforts to preserve the land around the sign have been helped by the economic downturn. With a falling market, the Trust for Public Land was able to secure a one-year option to buy the property for about $12.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sponsors say they are confident they will receive enough donations by the deadline. "It's going to happen," LaBonge said. "I think we're going to get there."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Aurora, Colo. ; Lower home prices than in Denver are a top selling point</span>
</div><div class="author">Christine Dugas </div><div>634 words</div><div>16 February 2010</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.2</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aurora, Colo., is considered an extension of Denver but is big enough to be the state's third-largest city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major benefit of living in Aurora: home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Denver does not have the same affordability that Aurora does," says David Barber, president of the Aurora Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many other cities' housing markets, Aurora's has benefited from the first-time home buyer tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In October and November many first-time home buyers rushed to take advantage of the federal tax credit before the November deadline, Barber says. By year's end, the expanded tax credit extension provided home buyers with more time to make decisions, which may have been a contributor to December sales that were 26.9% lower than the same month in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers are starting to resurface. Even high-end homes are attracting more attention because of the expanded tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not taking people who weren't considering buying a home and putting them into the market," Barber says of the tax credit extension. "But it's helping move forward people who have been vacillating about whether or not it's time to move into a new home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. In the city's core neighborhoods, modest homes built in the 1940s and 1950s abound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aurora's median sales price in December jumped 10.6% from December a year ago. Home foreclosures have slowed, which pushed prices up, as did a reduction in home inventory because of brisk fall sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Aurora's unemployment rate is included in the Denver metro area's, which was 7.5% in December, the same as the state's but lower than the national rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Aurora residents live and work in the construction and retail industries, which suffered in the recession, says Gary Horvath, managing director of the Business Research Division at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales posted strong gains in the fourth quarter and prices rose in nearly 45% of U.S. metropolitan areas compared with a year earlier, more evidence of an improving climate in housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bolstered by low interest rates and a first-time home buyers tax credit, existing-home sales rocketed 27.2% from the fourth quarter of 2008 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.03 million, the National Association of Realtors reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median price for an existing single-family home was $172,900, or 4.1% below the median price in fourth-quarter 2008. That was the smallest price decline in more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose in 67 out of 151 metro areas in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. Only 30 areas had annual price increases in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixteen areas had double-digit increases last quarter, led by Saginaw, Mich., up 53.5% to a median of $67,400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a growing body of evidence that the housing market has stabilized. The question is how quickly can it recover and will we bump along at the bottom for a couple of months?" says Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. "In the first couple of months of 2010, we should see a healthy turnaround."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baumohl says the combination of low interest rates and tax credits for qualifying home buyers should lure buyers, further stabilizing prices and boosting sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market could falter once the tax credit expires April 30 and if interest rates begin to climb later this year as many economists expect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit is worth up to $8,000 for first-time buyers and up to $6,500 for repeat buyers. But they must have purchase contracts signed by April 30 and close by June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national average mortgage rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate loan fell to 4.97% this week, down from 5.01% a week ago, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But foreclosures are expected to climb, which could further depress prices. Foreclosure filings were reported on 315,716 properties in January, 15% more than a year ago, RealtyTrac reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's premature to say the coast is clear. The housing credit really played a role in juicing up sales," says Mark Zandi at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "We're closer to the end of the downturn than the beginning, but we're not there yet."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Authentic" is a word that gets thrown around a lot in Crested Butte -- regardless of which Crested Butte you are in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is the old south-central Colorado mining town of Crested Butte, with its preserved Victorian architecture, narrow streets built for horses, and anti-franchise law that keeps it free of chain stores and restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the town of Mt. Crested Butte, better known as the ski resort, less than three miles away, the main reason most first- and second-home owners wind up here. With an apres-ski scene that is much more hot wings and draughts than sushi and martinis, the area reflects a devotion to tradition that has caused both locals and Ski Magazine to call this "America's Last Ski Town."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Telluride was a gold mining town, and Aspen was silver mining," says Bo Stambaugh, managing broker of Crested Butte Mountain Resort Real Estate. "This was coal mining, and that difference is still reflected today." When the owners of the ski resort commissioned a study to determine the area's "brand," the answer was preservation, Stambaugh says: "Preservation of the history, preservation of open space and preservation of the Western way of life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a major destination resort in the state's prime ski country, not a blue-collar working mine, and there are plenty of new condos and multimillion-dollar houses. But the condos have been developed on a discreet scale, and the mansions are relegated to larger wooded lots out of the public eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing is too far away, and a free bus system links the mountain with the town and surrounding amenities like the large Nordic ski center and even the city of Gunnison, county seat and home to the airport, about 35 miles south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among skiers, Crested Butte has a well-deserved reputation for its ultra-challenging extreme terrain. It has more double-black- diamond expert trails -- about 45 -- than any other resort in Colorado. But in a very real sense, the resort is two mountains in one. Almost all the extreme terrain lies in bowls above the tree line that most visitors never enter. The main mountain is like most large resorts, split almost entirely between beginner, intermediate and expert runs, and in fact, Crested Butte boasts excellent terrain for learning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summer activities are plentiful, but the area is best known as one of the birthplaces of mountain biking. It's home to the first organized race, extensive trail networks and the Mountain Biking Hall of Fame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEXT OF INFO BOXES BEGINS HERE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at three Crested Butte neighborhoods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Mt. Crested Butte. Unlike many ski resorts, there is only one base area. Most residences are walking distance to the lifts, and the majority of condos and townhouses range from $85,000 to just under $2 million, with a median price of $354,500. Single-family houses start at $360,000 and soar to more than $6 million, with a median near $1.2 million. Broker Bo Stambaugh says popular options for second-home owners are the newer Lodge at Mountaineer Square and older Grand Lodge, which let owners generate revenue when they're away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Town of Crested Butte. Though less expensive at the highest end than the ski resort, other price points are typically steeper because development is limited. There are far fewer condos and more small Victorian houses. It is more of a true community, and "one appeal is more year-round services and restaurants," Stambaugh says. Condos run $132,000 to $1.5 million, with a median of $492,500. Single-family houses run from the mid $400,000s to just under $3 million, with a median of $899,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Prospect. On the ski mountain and technically within the municipality of Mt. Crested Butte, this is its own 400-acre neighborhood and the only development outside the base area. Prospect is mostly custom homes on one- to two-acre lots, with one small development of pre-designed luxury houses clustered on smaller lots. The community is entirely residential and the most expensive in the region, with lots starting at $600,000. Pre-designed four- bedroom houses begin at $875,000, and custom homes run to $6 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A blizzard of commercial real estate defaults could bury hundreds of community banks, a congressional watchdog reports today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Congressional Oversight Panel, created to oversee the government's bailout fund, is warning that losses on commercial real estate loans could reach $300 billion, potentially wiping out "hundreds more community and midsize banks" and drying up the credit needed to restore the economy to health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next three years, a commercial real estate collapse "could overwhelm an already-weakened financial system," panel Chair Elizabeth Warren says in an interview. "The commercial real estate problems would be tough to absorb in any economic environment. But they come at a time when the economy is fragile and the banking system is even more fragile."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank failures numbered 140 last year and 16 so far in 2010. Now, commercial real estate is absorbing a one-two punch:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*A weak economy has pushed vacancy rates higher and rents lower, forcing developers to default on loans. <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> says the situation looks like the early '90s commercial real estate meltdown that killed hundreds of banks. Citing figures from the real estate firm <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, S&amp;P says office vacancy rates reached 17.3% in the third quarter of 2009 and are likely headed higher, vs. a peak of 18.9% in 1991. Retail vacancies are already at 12.3%, vs. 11.3% in '91. S&amp;P says most banks it rates can survive if losses spread over a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*About $1.4 trillion in commercial real estate loans will mature between now and 2014, which in many cases means developers will need to refinance or make balloon payments that exceed the value of the underlying properties. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> estimates that more than 65% of commercial real estate loans might not qualify for refinancing because banks have tightened underwriting standards and property values have collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller banks will bear the brunt of commercial real estate losses: "Over the last decade, the Wall Street banks sucked up all the credit card and home mortgage lending that used to be the bread and butter of these community banks," Warren says. So they turned to commercial real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A robust economic recovery "would be the best elixir," says real estate analyst Jonathan Miller. "Our forecast suggests that probably will not happen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will the government rescue little banks the way it rescued big ones? Says Warren, "Who will bear the losses? Some will be borne by investors, some will be borne by community banks and some may be borne by taxpayers. ... We're going to have to make some tough choices."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris and Candice Basso would like to move up to a larger home this spring, taking advantage of a federal tax credit worth up to $6,500 for repeat home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even a big tax credit won't be enough to lift them into a bigger, better home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Centreville, Va., couple are trapped in a two-bedroom townhouse that's worth less than their unpaid mortgage. They face the same predicament with a condo that they own and rent out. Unable to sell either property for what they owe and with their equity wiped out, a new mortgage is out of the question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Basso fears it may be years before they can buy a bigger place -- a real concern, because Candice is scheduled to give birth to their first child in August, and their townhouse already feels cramped. "I'll have a teenager by the time housing values come back up and I can get out of my house," says Basso. With a baby coming, "We're trying to figure out where to fit all the furniture. We still scour the home listings every day just to see what we could afford now. It's heartbreaking to see what we could get today with our housing dollar now, but we're stuck."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuck, like millions of other homeowners, also underwater on their mortgages, thanks to sinking home prices. The plight of people such as the Bassos is a big worry for the housing industry as the crucial spring season nears, when nearly a third of the year's sales are made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the tax credit -- which expires April 30 -- and 30-year fixed mortgage rates that are still hovering around 5%, it's an open question whether enough move-up buyers will enter the market this spring to bolster housing's fledgling recovery and energize a broader economic rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For a well-functioning market, you have to have that trade-up buyer," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zandi estimates that more than 15 million homeowners are underwater -- about one in five, he says. First American CoreLogic, using a different methodology, estimates 10.7 million residential properties had negative equity at the end of September, or almost one in four, by its reckoning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, a substantial number of homeowners are financially unable to enter the home-buying market just now. "Trade-up buyers are normally a big chunk of the market," Zandi says. "We're going into (the spring market) with less steam."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Move-up buyers made up 53% of 2009's shrunken market, down from about 60% in recent years, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). If they don't return in larger numbers, the inventory of mid- to high-price homes will remain high -- dragging down home values overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress recognized the importance of move-up home buyers when it renewed and expanded last year's popular first-time buyers credit to cover people who have bought homes before. Under the credit's rules, people who owned the home being sold or vacated as their primary residence for five-consecutive years in the past eight are eligible for a credit of up to $6,500 on the purchase of a replacement home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deadlines are tight: Purchase contracts must be signed by April 30, and closings have to occur by June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR estimates 1.5 million homeowners will take advantage of the credit, but there's no way to tell how many deals would have occurred without the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underwater homeowners aren't the only ones unable to benefit from the credit. Many potential buyers in higher-price markets such as New York, Boston, Hawaii and San Francisco won't qualify because their incomes are too high. Under the income limits, single taxpayers with incomes up to $125,000 and married couples with incomes up to $225,000 qualify for the full tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Here in New York and a lot of major metro areas, they will blow that income cap," says Edward Ades, a vice president with mortgage brokerage Universal Mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate professionals say buyers who expected to benefit from the tax credit are frustrated when they discover they aren't eligible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of people think it will be great, and then they look into it and find out they won't get it. A lot of these people are young professionals," says Janice Leis, a broker in Boca Raton, Fla. "It's like false advertising. They get out with their hopes up, and they get their hopes dashed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good times for first-timers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past year has been good for first-time home buyers. The collapse in home prices, low interest rates and last year's first- time buyers tax credit made buying a home more affordable than it's been in years. But for people who bought homes at or near the market peak in 2005, moving out and up to more expensive houses has been harder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local market figures bear this out: Sales of entry-level homes are booming, while sales of pricier homes are sliding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Los Angeles metro area, sales of entry-level homes at a median price of $248,737 soared from 28% of transactions in November 2007 to nearly 46% in 2009, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are flocking to snatch up homes in that price range, which include 900-square-foot homes in the heart of the city with palm trees in the front yard, and two-bedroom, 890-square-foot condos in the beachside neighborhood of Playa del Rey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the low end, there is absolutely activity," says Carol Grogan, with <span class="companylink">Prudential California Realty</span>. "It's amazing. If it's under $500,000, especially if it's a house, there's high demand. It's crazy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales of mid- and high-price homes have dropped sharply. From November 2007 to November 2009, homes at a median price of $408,417 have slid from 37% of transactions to about 32%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes priced at a median of $707,543 have fallen from about 35% to 23%, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a fifth of the homes in the Los Angeles metro area, covering Long Beach and Glendale, are underwater, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com's data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a similar situation in the Seattle metro area, where a fifth of the homes are underwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing more activity in the lower level," says Cathy Millan, a Realtor with <span class="companylink">Windermere Real Estate</span> in Seattle. "There have been a lot of first-time home buyers coming through, but the higher end is sitting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of entry-level homes at a median price of $209,952 jumped from 37% in November 2007 to 40% in November 2009, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those priced at a median of $478,282 slipped from 32% in November 2007 to 30% in November 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of interest</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its shortcomings, the tax credit may be having some impact. Realtors say buyers are talking about both the move-up tax credit, as well as the credit of up to $8,000 for first-time buyers, when they look at homes. Some say the tax credit is launching the spring buying season unusually early this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlie Russo, a sales counselor with Plantation Homes, a home builder in Firethorne, Texas, says there's no question the credits have pulled some buyers into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The low interest rates really have people in the market, and then the money (from the tax credit) is a huge incentive for people who weren't looking right now," Russo says. "It's a perfect storm of incentives for them. No one ever paid me to buy a house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit is a motivator for Marifran Manzo-Ritchie, who says now seems like the perfect time for her to sell her home and buy another place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems perfect because the home she bought in Phoenixville, Pa., for $150,000 seven years ago is now worth about $280,000 following the revitalization of the former steel town. Plus, her family, with three children, needs more space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If she closes on a new home by June 30 as she believes she'll be able to, she'll qualify for the move-up home buyer tax credit. She and her husband are already working with a Realtor to list the house this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our home, which once seemed so big, seems very, very small now. And our property value has increased, so we have the equity," says Manzo-Ritchie, 34, who runs a marketing agency from home. "But it's the tax credit that really lit the fire under us."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wilmington, N.C., housing market ended the year on a good note, despite the region's tough economic times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rebounded from a slow start when a boost from the first-time home buyer tax credit kicked in. The buyers who took advantage of it accounted for 34% of home sales last year, says Mary Martin, president of the Wilmington Regional Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the tax credit has been extended and expanded to include repeat home buyers, agents hope it will keep sales moving. But beach property sales are still lagging: Loans are much stricter for vacation-home buyers and investors, Martin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Last year, Wilmington home sales were down 16.2% compared with the previous year. But in the last quarter of the year, sales reversed. In December, sales were up 19.8% from December 2008. The improvement has raised hopes that the market has hit bottom and may be turning around, Martin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. The median price of houses sold was 5.6% less than a year earlier. Home foreclosures are declining. "Prices seem to be stabilizing, which is good," Martin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes are being concentrated in the $200,000-to-$250,000 range, because those are selling, Martin says. The price range is not just desired by first-time home buyers: Older empty-nester couples are moving into such smaller homes, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. The unemployment rate was 10.2% in November, slightly higher than the national rate of 10% at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been more hard hit with this downturn than any of the five that I've experienced as an economist," says William Hall, professor of economics at University of North Carolina-Wilmington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate development industry in particular is suffering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That is more than just construction. It includes finance, insurance, real estate leasing, architects and others," Hall says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About three years ago, economic analysts estimated that one out of five people in southeastern North Carolina had a job related to real estate development. The numbers are closer to one in 10 now, Hall says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Wilmington is a historic port city. The downtown area has cobblestone streets, boutiques, restaurants and the Cape Fear Riverwalk. Many people love the historic charm, Martin says. And of late, more of them can afford to live downtown because condominiums have been built there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new buildings are not modern-looking on the outside, because the city requires them to fit in downtown. The price for a one- bedroom condo ranges from about $160,000 to $180,000, while a two- bedroom starts at about $200,000, Martin says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the gold rush hit Fairbanks, Alaska, in the early 1900s, its natural resources have seen alternating periods of boom and bust. But the city diversified its economy and no longer solely relies on mining for economic and housing stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market avoided the gold-rush-type bubble and collapse that the nation saw in recent years. "We've been pretty lucky," says Eileen Cummings, president of Greater Fairbanks Board of Realtors. "We have not bottomed out like California -- not anything close to that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean the state's second-largest city didn't see home prices climb sharply. That happened about four years ago, but they've come down to normal, Cummings says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. The beginning of 2009 was not good for Fairbanks' housing market. But by year's end, sales were climbing sharply. In December, home sales were up 66.2% from December 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Fairbanks has had some foreclosures, but not to an extent that they dragged down overall prices. The median sales price was 8.1% higher than a year earlier. The first-time-home-buyer tax credit helped stimulate home sales at the end of the year, Cummings says. Homes priced at $200,000 to $250,000 are selling better than higher-end homes, which are struggling, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Fairbanks' unemployment rate was 7.9% in November, lower than the state's rate of 8.4%. The University of Alaska-Fairbanks helps give its job market stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also the seat of Fairbanks North Star Borough, which has two military bases. Late last year, about 4,000 members of the 1st Stryker Brigade returned from Iraq to the Fort Wainwright Army base. "Soldiers who came back were buying things and going out to dinner, things that help stimulate the economy," says state economist Alyssa Shanks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Fairbanks has long winters that often last from late September to early May, so many older residents prefer to live in the city, which is close to stores and restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fairbanks is building a senior housing project, Raven Landing, with affordable condominiums. The complex is near the library, hospital and shopping. Prices range from $200,000 to $250,000, Cummings says. "It's an opportunity for those who want to stay in Fairbanks when they retire, but their life needs to be easier," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median-price home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This home, built in 2007, is on the market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 1565, St. Augustine is the USA's oldest city and attracts many admirers to its Spanish Colonial architecture. But today, a different "historical" attraction draws more than 300,000 visitors a year: Home to the World Golf Hall of Fame, St. Augustine is a magnet for vacationing and second-home golfers along Florida's northeast coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TPC Sawgrass Stadium Course, opened in 1980, put the area on the golf map. About 40 minutes north in Ponte Vedra Beach, it is the world headquarters of the PGA Tour and home to The Players Championship. Because of its novelty and annual TV exposure, the island par-3 17th hole is arguably the most recognizable golf hole on Earth, and the course is perennially ranked among the nation's top 10. The Stadium is just one of more than a dozen courses in Ponte Vedra Beach, including the TPC Valley and Sawgrass Country Club. The town is a popular golf second-home community, and such top PGA Tour stars as Vijay Singh have houses here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ironically, it's the golf that gets people down here, but it's our beaches and proximity to the ocean that gets them to buy," says Rob Kearney of Kearney Real Estate Services, an avid golfer and Ponte Vedra Beach resident himself. "It used to be mostly second homes, but it has grown into a bedroom community for Jacksonville (about a 30-minute drive northwest), and there's something for everyone: condos, garden homes, single-family houses, inland, oceanfront, and on the golf course."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">St. Augustine is home to the World Golf Village, a vast residential and resort community that includes the World Golf Hall of Fame, two famous courses, shops, restaurants, hotels, a golf academy and about 1,000 houses and condos, with 4,500 residences in the master plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's less expensive than the Ponte Vedra golf communities," Kearney says. "Outside the World Golf Village, downtown St. Augustine buyers typically like history and the arts and are more ocean-oriented."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, the golf has stretched south to Palm Coast, where some of the game's most famous designers have built oceanfront courses. Many buyers consider this stretch to be an undiscovered pocket, more natural and uncongested than the coast north of St. Augustine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEXT OF INFO BOXES BEGINS HERE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at three St. Augustine-area neighborhoods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Ponte Vedra Beach: Like Pinehurst or St. Andrews, the PGA Tour's hometown is synonymous with golf. There are private and semi- private country club communities, including TPC Sawgrass, but prices are surprisingly reasonable. Realtor Rob Kearney says condos start in the mid-$200,000s, houses around $300,000. Waterfront houses fetch up to $7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*St. Augustine: The nation's oldest city has a mix of suburban golf communities,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">most notably the World Golf Village, and more traditional beach- resort living, with many high-rise oceanfront buildings. "Condos in the golf village start at just over $100,000 and homes from $200,000. You can get beachfront condos for just over $100,000," Kearney says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hammock Beach: This golf community about 30 minutes south of St. Augustine has courses by Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson, tennis, large marina, restaurants, fitness facilities and spa. Second-home owners make up more than half the residents. In the luxurious new Ocean Towers, units run $600,000-$1.2 million. "On the resale market, homes start about $600,000, home sites at about $150,000 and three-bedroom condos around $450,000," says Craig Straky of the Luxury Realty Group of Florida.</p>

</div><div class="author">Stephanie Armour </div><div>552 words</div><div>27 January 2010</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.3</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices slid in November, raising questions about whether the housing recovery is robust enough to maintain a sustained turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From October to November, home prices fell 0.2% after declining 0.1% in October, according to a report Tuesday by <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/ Case-Shiller's home price index. Only five of the 20 metro areas tracked by the index saw price increases for the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an annual basis, prices were 5.3% lower in November than in November 2008. Prices were the same as in late 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we've seen over the past couple of months is that the pace of recovery has fallen down," says Maureen Maitland, of <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>. "Some markets have fallen back. Is that because we haven't worked through the foreclosure cycle? Because of unemployment? We're not seeing the improvement we were seeing in (the last) summer months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metro areas that have seen a retreat in home prices include Seattle, Charlotte, Las Vegas and Tampa. All four saw gains they made in recent months erased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, for the 20-metro index, the annual rate of decline is improving. That trend, with other recent housing reports that show prices stabilizing or accelerating, could point to signs the housing market is starting to regain its footing, some economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sale prices were $178,300 in December, which is 1.5% higher than December 2008, according to a report this week by the National Association of Realtors. That was the first year-over- year gain in median price since August 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The most encouraging thing we can say is not only is (the market) stabilizing, but we've seen that housing demand is strong," says Bernard Baumohl, with the Economic Outlook Group. "Housing probably will continue to climb upwards through the summer, although it could slip a little as the tax credit (for first-time and move- up home buyers) expires."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets show upbeat signs. Prices in Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego and San Francisco have risen for at least six months. Prices in Dallas, Denver, San Diego and San Francisco are higher than a year earlier, a situation largely unseen in at least two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurdles facing the housing recovery include high unemployment, which is driving foreclosures, and the likelihood that interest rates will rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is slowly withdrawing stimulus efforts that have propped up the housing market, says Mark Zandi at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. The question now is how the market will fare largely on its own: "All these policy efforts have come together and provided a lift, and that lift is abating, so we'll have some home price declines."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales last month saw their biggest drop in more than 40 years as buyers left the market because they weren't sure Congress would extend a tax credit for first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a surge in sales from September through November, existing home sales tumbled 16.7% in December from November, according to a report Monday from the National Association of Realtors (NAR). That is still 15% above the December 2008 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2009, there were 5.1 million existing home sales, which was 4.9% higher than the 4.9 million sales in 2008 -- the first annual sales gain since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a little bit more of a drop than expected, but it's still up 15% over the year," says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors, adding that the drop in December is largely due to worries the government would end the home-buyer tax credit. "The housing market mainlined the government stimulus and then went cold turkey. It's hard."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for existing homes had accelerated in large part due to the tax credit of up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers, but that credit was due to expire on Nov. 30, 2009. Many new home buyers rushed to buy before that deadline, pushing up sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also why 51% of purchasers were first-time home buyers in November. But with the tax credit due to expire, sales -- and first- time buyers -- dropped out of the market; purchases by first-time buyers slipped to 43% of homes last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress extended the credit, and added a new credit of up to $6,500 for move-up buyers; to qualify, purchasers have until June 30 to close on a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, "There are no signs (sales) are picking up yet," says Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight. "People who are waiting are taking a risk, because interest rates are expected to go up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 4.99% for the week ended Jan. 21, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Newport says rates could climb to 5.3% by the end of the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I anticipate interest rates will be closer to 6% by year's end," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR. "It is a drag to the (housing) recovery but not damaging. Job creation in the second half of the year should offset that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median existing home price was $178,300 in December, which is 1.5% higher than December 2008. The price increase is attributed in part to more mid- and upper-price homes in the sales mix.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frederick, Md., is about 50 miles northwest of Washington, D.C., but is considered a bedroom community of the nation's capital. Like other such communities, its housing market rose sharply in the boom times and got crushed afterward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But its quaint downtown and proximity to a commuter rail line may help its market rebound while others stagnate, says Peter Morici, economist at the University of Maryland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2004 to 2007, Frederick saw huge housing demand and low supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You could put a house on the market and within the weekend you'd have six or seven offers," says Sandy Fouche, president-elect of the Frederick County Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the bubble burst, home sales dropped. The number of homes on the market grew from a two-month supply to 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. The housing market started coming back in the second quarter of 2009. "People got off the fence and were interested in buying," Fouche says. And, in December, Frederick home sales were 24.1% higher than the same month in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Lower home prices sparked the sales, along with the first-time home buyer tax credit. The median price of Frederick houses sold in December was 4.1% lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. The unemployment rate for Frederick County was 6.1% in November, lower than the state's rate of 7.3%. Many people who live there have stable federal jobs, Morici says. Frederick also is home to Bechtel and Fort Detrick, a large Army post where the expanding field of biomedical research is occurring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Downtown Frederick is quaint, with an old main street and buildings that date to the 1800s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It has small-town charm, and yet it's in the process of being developed," says Ken Wenhold, regional director of the mid-Atlantic region for the real estate information firm Metrostudy. "If you could buy one of the older row homes near downtown, it would be a fantastic buy and you could pretty much walk to anything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because prices have gone down, the historic properties are more affordable. Before the downturn, they would cost up to $950,000, Fouche says. Downtown prices are now closer to $400,000 and $500,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- After a week-long pounding of heavy rain, wind and surf, Southern California looked forward to the end of a series of Pacific storms that forced the evacuation of people from hundreds of homes and raised fears of killer mudslides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As snow at higher elevations forced the closure of major highways, and flooding complicated commutes, traffic was snarled across the region and hundreds of flights were canceled at area airports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rescuers pulled a teenager from the swollen Santa Ana River in Orange County, but a second boy remained missing. A tornado near the California-Arizona line toppled three trucks on Interstate 10 and downed power lines along two other desert highways, California transportation spokeswoman Terri Kasinga said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mud oozed into one home near the top of a canyon at La Caoada Flintridge, a foothills community on the fringes of the San Gabriel Mountains, Los Angeles County fire and sheriff's department officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City and county leaders continued to plead with residents to remain out of areas vulnerable to mudslides, even as they said mountainsides stripped of vegetation by last year's wildfires appeared to be holding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">County Fire Chief Deputy John Tripp warned that significant debris flows were still likely and probably would block any rescue attempts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For those people that are still in the homes and are in those areas of threat, it's very likely we will not be able to reach you," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among many who refused to leave, George Wiktor and a neighbor spent much of the day shoveling debris to keep water flowing off a hillside and into the streets rather than into their La Caoada Flintridge homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We just had a little flash flood, where a lot came down all at once, but ... we're in pretty good shape," he said. "It was exciting, fun, interesting. That's why I stay here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">County Fire Capt. Henry Rodriguez said firefighter and public works crews put sandbags around the unoccupied home where mud was intruding and diverted the flow into the street. He said firefighters continued to watch hillsides for signs the earth could give way -- a threat that will continue after the rain stops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've got an area that is bare, and it's taking a lot of water. It's absorbed quite a bit, and we're not out of the woods," Rodriguez said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">County Public Works Director Gail Farber said the flood-control system, including more than two dozen debris-collection basins, was helping to clear the danger areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our system has done what it was meant to," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flooding was reported in many areas, including Long Beach and coastal communities to the south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seal Beach resident Mike McClain and other volunteers filled about 3,000 sandbags to give out to neighbors. He said many homes and businesses near the beach had taken water over the previous three days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The storm surge is coming, and the water is already up -- it's to the bottom of the pier now," McClain said. "This is as bad as I've ever seen it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National Weather Service meteorologist Todd Hall said today will still be soggy in Southern California, but he added, "We should be drying out over the weekend."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weather service reported an all-time-record-low barometric pressure -- indicative of a very strong storm -- was recorded in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heavy rains whipped Arizona as well. Phoenix was forecast to receive 2 to 4 inches of rain Thursday night and today, weather service forecaster Keith Kincaid said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yuma, Ariz., one of the driest cities in the USA, received more than 2 inches of rain this week. The city's annual average is a mere 3.4 inches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remnants of the western storms will plague much of the central and eastern USA this weekend, according to meteorologist Mark Ressler of <span class="companylink">The Weather Channel</span>. Rain, snow, freezing rain, thunderstorms and wind are likely to hammer portions of the Plains and Midwest on Saturday, and the Southeast and Eastern Seaboard by Sunday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Tim and Diane Mueller took over the small south-central Vermont ski area of Okemo from its previous owner, the nearby town of Ludlow, the young parents knew they'd need a niche to set their resort apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Okemo, like nearly every major ski resort in Vermont, is on land leased from the state or national forest service. But the Muellers bought land surrounding the mountain so they could build slope-side residences. These convenient ski-in/ski-out units appealed to family buyers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- and nearly three decades later, the couple's family-friendly emphasis is still paying off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Okemo says it has the most ski-access real estate of any resort in New England, with nearly 1,300 houses and condos surrounding its slopes. Its focus on grooming, ski school, beginner and intermediate terrain, services and activities have made it the region's family favorite for the second-home drive market. Last year, the resort saw more than 600,000 skier visits, and Parents Magazine rated it the USA's top family snow resort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Okemo has completed the first phase of its largest expansion, a new base area and interconnected mountain, Jackson Gore. The village base is dedicated to family amenities, with an ice rink, shops and restaurants, a fitness/aquatic center, several indoor and outdoor pools and hot tubs, fire pits and more. It also added expert terrain, something Okemo was lacking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ludlow, whose main street sits at Okemo's entrance, has grown with the ski resort and offers some of the state's best shopping, dining and activities. During the summer, Ludlow is popular with bikers and offers extensive hiking trails, fly-fishing and a top public golf course.</p>

This newest section of the ski area has its own entrance and base area, which is self-contained with numerous non- skiing amenities and the resort's first fractional offerings. About half of the 325 approved residences have been built and sold, and all are in condo hotels, where owners have the option of renting out when not in use</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">to generate income. All units are trailside, have heated underground parking and are fully furnished.Whole ownership begins at $529,000 for a one-bedroom, and quarter shares range from $59,000 for a studio to $325,000 for a three-bedroom.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The springtime spurt in home buying may hit before the snow melts this year as buyers scramble to meet an April 30 tax credit deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring buying season typically takes off in March and runs through May. But buyers who want to claim this year's tax credit -- up to $8,000 for first-time buyers and up to $6,500 for repeat buyers -- must have signed purchase contracts by April 30. And they have to complete the deal by June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I expect the buying season will be moved up," says Jim Gillespie, CEO of Coldwell Banker. Sales "are going to take off in February and March and really take off in April. ... My concern is that the move-up buyer hasn't thought what they need to do. Their window is really short. They have to coordinate closing dates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average time it takes to get a home loan processed is about eight weeks now -- two weeks more than it used to be, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit's impact on 2010 home sales is uncertain. Some economists expect the credit to pull sales that would have occurred later in the year into the first half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The tax credit will absolutely have an effect," says Pete Flint, CEO of Trulia, a residential real estate search engine. "It is going to shift demand from the later part of the year to the first part. January and February will be very strong. The next three months, there will be a surge in demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit is pulling in some consumers now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm actually in the middle of house shopping, and I decided to do it now so that I could get the $8,000 tax credit," says Amity Gay, 26, who's looking for a cottage-style house in Tallahassee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers should be prepared to appeal to first-time home buyers, who still make up the majority of buyers, according to Pat Lashinsky, president and CEO of ZipRealty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And buyers should expect rising prices in some markets, including San Diego, Dallas, Minneapolis, Chicago and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> Home, buyers are being preapproved now for new housing developments; an increase in demand is being attributed to the expanded tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our spring market got moved up at least two months because of this," says Kent Geschwender, branch manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit was scheduled to expire on Dec. 1, 2009, but was extended and expanded by Congress.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Beaumont, Texas, housing market looks like a disaster until you look beyond the immediate numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September 2008, Beaumont and southeastern Texas were pummeled by Hurricane Ike. Entire neighborhoods in nearby coastal towns washed away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once homeowners' insurance payments started arriving, many new homes were purchased, causing sales to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the last 10-year history, Beaumont has had slow, steady home sales and appreciation," says Dana Johnson, president of the Beaumont Board of Realtors. "We have not had any huge spikes, and we've not had any big dips."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Even though 2009 was fairly good, in November, home sales in Beaumont were 10.4% lower than the same month in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. The median home price of Beaumont houses sold in November was 7.2% lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price is lower because most buyers have focused on the low end of the market. Some of that is due to the number of first-time home buyers who were taking advantage of the federal tax credit. And without zero-down loans, more buyers are shopping for affordable, lower-price homes, Johnson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. The unemployment rate for Beaumont and nearby Port Arthur was 10.4% in November, higher than the state's rate of 8.0%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Beaumont's job market is primarily service-oriented, nearby Port Arthur has more blue-collar, oil industry jobs, says James Gaines, a research economist at Texas A&amp;M University's Real Estate Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the oil refineries expanded, the number of construction workers temporarily increased. Refineries are run by a small number of workers, and now that the construction has ended, employment is down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Downtown improvement projects have started in Beaumont.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, luxury townhouses were built, with restaurants opening nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first lofts were built in a historic building, and new buildings emulated it. Loft prices range from $150,000 to $160,000, while larger townhomes start at about $160,000 and go up to $175,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area is unique, Johnson says: People who have moved there have block parties and have melded well with the city lifestyle.</p>

</div><div class="author">Stephanie Armour </div><div>433 words</div><div>14 January 2010</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.3</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure filings increased 14% in December from November, the first monthly increase since foreclosure activity peaked in July, according to a RealtyTrac report out today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure filings were reported on 349,519 properties in December, which were also 15% higher than in December 2008, RealtyTrac said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's somewhat startling to see these kind of numbers," says Brian Bethune at IHS Global Insight. "There are a few areas that are improving. New York has had no further deterioration. But the problem states, like Florida, California and Arizona, are still suffering."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After peaking at more than 361,000 homes in July, foreclosure filings had been falling because of trial loan modifications, state legislation extending the foreclosure process and a large volume of homes in the foreclosure pipeline, RealtyTrac CEO James Saccacio said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure activity in the fourth quarter decreased 7% from the third quarter, although it was still up 18% from the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after four consecutive month-over-month declines in California, foreclosure activity there in December increased nearly 9% from November. California's fourth-quarter foreclosure activity was still down 17% from the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 2.4 million homes are expected to be lost through foreclosure, auction and other means in 2010, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. That's despite the Obama administration's efforts to get banks to rework strapped borrowers' home loans into lower monthly payments. The goal is to prevent foreclosures by providing homeowners with more-affordable mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of early December, more than 700,000 homeowners had received trial modifications. The Treasury Department will release updated numbers on Friday. "The foreclosure crisis continues on. I don't see any stabilization," says Mark Zandi at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. "The foreclosure crisis is in full swing, and the (mortgage) modification efforts aren't working that well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ongoing foreclosure crisis, he says, will continue to lead to falling home prices in spring and summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Filings were reported on 2.8 million properties in 2009, a 21% increase in total properties from 2008 and up 120% from 2007, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure filings could ease as more banks agree to short sales, allowing delinquent homeowners to sell homes for less than the balance of their mortgage. The Obama administration is attempting to encourage short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We should also see more short sales, because lenders are becoming more comfortable with it, and it costs them less" than a foreclosure, Zandi says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction ran 1/14/2010: A story Tuesday misidentified the name of the president of the Appraisal Institute. His name is Leslie Sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers who take out federally insured home loans will soon find their mortgage brokers can't select appraisers, part of an effort to ensure appraisers aren't pressured to inflate home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting Feb. 15, mortgage brokers will no longer be able to order appraisals on loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). For consumers, that is supposed to mean home appraisals will more closely reflect a home's value. The reason: Brokers who may profit from a loan being approved won't also be choosing appraisers, who may feel pressured to declare a higher value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But organizations such as the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and the Appraisal Institute say the change, along with other efforts to reform the appraisal industry, is hurting consumers and appraisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They say new rules that swept through the appraisal industry in 2009 -- rules designed to ensure appraisals are impartial -- are resulting in excessively low home values, because chosen appraisers aren't as experienced or as familiar with local markets. They also say the appraisers take more time, causing delays in getting appraisals done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The appraisal must be completely independent of the lending side, but there are extensive time delays," says Joe Ventrone, vice president for regulatory and industry affairs with NAR. "The values that come back are lower. A $300,000 house might come back (appraised) at $200,000."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A changed business</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes began in May when <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> adopted a code designed to separate loan officers from the hiring of appraisers. Since Freddie and Fannie account for nine-tenths of new home loan originations, it reshaped the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The code means brokers, Realtors and loan-production staff -- anyone who stands to earn a commission based on the value of the transaction -- can't hire an appraiser. Instead, lenders are turning to third-party appraisal management companies that typically hire appraisers on contract to do the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Title/Appraisal Vendor Management Association (TAVMA), the trade association of the real estate settlement services industry, says the third-party firms have well-qualified appraisers to do the job. They also say if appraisal values come in low, it's only because home prices have fallen due to the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is mistaken to say appraisal management companies are the cause of these values. It's the market," says Don Blanchard, former president of TAVMA and general counsel of Lender Processing Services, which provides appraisal services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some trade groups say that appraisal management companies are providing appraisers -- often from outside the market where the house is located -- who are less qualified than independent appraisers that brokers and Realtors might choose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors says a member survey found almost 70% saying appraisal times had risen by more than eight days under the new rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The banks chose to go to third parties to completely take over tasks. They tend to find the cheapest appraisers they can find," says Leslie Miller, president of the Appraisal Institute, which is calling on regulators to require higher competency standards in the current code. "They're often the least qualified."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The management companies also are providing appraisers who take jobs at such low fees that independent appraisers who have been in the business for decades are being driven from the field, Miller says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rob Oryl, an independent appraiser in Collingswood, N.J., says he is seeing it happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I know a great appraiser with a staff who had been in the business for years who now just works out of his home," Oryl says. "It's driving people out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diann Patton, broker and owner of Coldwell Banker Grass Roots Realty in Grass Valley, Calif., says the new rules are making it tougher for her industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's absolutely changed the whole process, and now it will be the same with FHA (loans)," Patton says. "The problem is, we're getting appraisers who are out of this area. They're gung-ho, but don't know the area."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Youngstown, Ohio, immortalized by Bruce Springsteen's Rust Belt anthem, the hits keep coming, but there is hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auto industry job losses have hit the city and its surrounding county, Mahoning, hard. But the region's housing market -- crushed at the onset of the country's housing meltdown -- appears to be rebounding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bargain home prices and the city's proximity to four airports are attracting buyers from other parts of the country, says David Klacik, president of the Youngstown Columbiana Association of Realtors. A buyer from Australia recently purchased property in Mahoning County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In November, Mahoning County home sales were down slightly, 1.9% less than the same month in 2008. But condominium sales were 6% higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. The median home price in Mahoning jumped 43.1% in November compared with a year earlier. In many cities, home prices have been dragged down by foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Youngstown is a conservative town, and its housing market and house appraisals never got out of hand, Klacik says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We took our lumps early," says Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics in Pepper Pike, Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Youngstown's unemployment rate was 13.0% in November, higher than the state's rate of 10.6%. Years ago, it was a steel-producing area; now, it's a shade of its former glory, Mayland says. Its major industry is a General Motors plant in nearby Lordstown, where jobs have declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fears also abounded that the plant might permanently close, he says. But the plant has been selected as a production site for a new Chevrolet car model, the Chevy Cruze. Production will begin in the third quarter of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Mill Creek MetroParks has more than 4,400 acres of land and two 18-hole championship golf courses. It offers boating, tennis and other recreation. Now that prices have fallen, the homes and villas provide a deal for second-home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It has amenities and value," Klacik says. Some of the homes were built in the '50s and '60s, and the prices range from $80,000 to $140,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southern California may be world-famous for its surfing. But come winter, thousands of residents throw boards into their cars and skip the waves for a five-hour drive north to the slopes at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area in the Eastern Sierra, near the Nevada border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a whopping 3,500 acres with 28 lifts, Mammoth is one of the nation's largest ski resorts, and with a peak elevation of just over 11,000 feet, it's higher than its Lake Tahoe-area competitors. Yet until recently, it had been off the radar for most U.S. skiers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last winter's launch of a daily flight from LAX proved so popular that <span class="companylink">Horizon Air</span> added a second daily round trip this winter, as well as flights from San Jose and Reno, with San Francisco slated for next winter. Service will also continue through the summer for the first time. Thanks to the short flights and large number of connections into LAX and Reno airports, Mammoth is now within reach of a much larger audience. The added accessibility has been accompanied by a revitalization of stores, hotels and dining, and has spurred future development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ski area is on some of the Inyo National Forest land that surrounds the 4-square-mile town of Mammoth Lakes (population about 7,100). As its name suggests, winter is not the only appeal here. A chain of five lakes offers fishing, canoeing and kayaking; there are extensive networks of hiking and mountain biking trails; and the eastern entrance to Yosemite National Park is just 30 miles away. "As good as the skiing is, there's a lot more to do in the summer," says Steve Rose of the Westin Monache Resort, Mammoth's only nationally branded hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to broker Julie Wright of the Snowcreek Property Co., nearly all residences are second homes. Reflecting the state's economic malaise, prices dropped about 40% across the board in the past two years before starting to stabilize in the second half of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike most ski towns, few people live in downtown Mammoth Lakes, which is mostly shops, restaurants and support services, and there is also very little on-mountain, ski-in/ski-out lodging. The vast majority of residential offerings are in numerous small neighborhoods and developments scattered between town and the slopes, with a smaller number in the newer base village within steps of the lifts. The area is served by an extensive free bus system. Because the number of hotels is quite limited, rental demand for residences is strong when not in use. But local ordinances prohibit short-term rentals of single-family houses, so condos are very popular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEXT OF INFO BOXES BEGINS HERE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at three Mammoth neighborhoods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Snowcreek: According to broker Julie Wright, this 450-acre residential community is the largest in Mammoth Lakes, with about 900 condos, townhouses and single-family houses spread over several enclaves. Begun in the 1970s, it is now in its seventh phase, and plans include a luxury hotel and an extension of its nine-hole golf course. Snowcreek is operated as a resort, with most owners putting units into an overnight rental pool. Facilities include the golf course, athletic club, spa and restaurant. Units cost $300,000 to $1.85 million, with many in the $600,000-$800,000 range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Village at Mammoth: The newest part of the mountain has a small pedestrian mall with shops, restaurants and condos, and a gondola and ski trail linking it to the ski area's main base. Wright says the Village offers less square footage per dollar, but the appeal is proximity to the gondola. The top option is the 2-year-old Westin, a condo hotel that has sold all but about 10 of its 230 rooms, exclusively to second-home owners. Remaining units range from studio to two-bedroom, $195,000-$575,000, very close to the gondola.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Altis Mammoth: This new slopeside community being developed by the ski area will have just 24 "mountain modern" townhouses, all Silver LEED Certified and ski-in/ski-out, a true rarity here. Four units have been completed; Altis residences are priced at $2.1 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have cooled, and they may not warm up until spring -- when buyers will face another deadline to claim a federal tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that its index of pending home sales fell 16% in November from October, breaking a nine-month string of gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales got a big lift in October when first-time home buyers were scrambling to make a Nov. 30 deadline. When the credit was extended into 2010 -- and expanded to repeat buyers -- buyers took a breather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, buyers must have a contract in place to buy a home by April 30 and close on the home by June 30 to qualify for a tax credit. It's worth up to $8,000 for first-time buyers and $6,500 for repeat buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say last year's credit pulled sales from early this year, and this year's credit is likely to borrow sales that otherwise would have happened late in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the national chill in home sales isn't being felt across the country, say mortgage brokers, real estate investors and others in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, broker Tanya Marchiol of Team Investments says there is no sign that sales are slowing down. "We are busier than you can even imagine. We have a lot of people moving here for climate reasons and the technology industry," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed sales, including foreclosures, are also drawing buyers' interest. "The investor market is really taking off," she says. "They can get a home for 40 cents on the dollar and sell it for 80 cents on the dollar."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just investors in Phoenix who are busy. Real estate investor Wayne Rogers is developing a 500-home subdivision near Crestview, Fla. He is tapping into the first-time home buyer market by building two- and three-bedroom homes priced under $250,000. Those, he says, continue to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Jersey City, sales remain brisk at a former brick pencil factory that was converted into loftlike residences selling in the $200,000s and $300,000s. There has been no slowdown, says Kristin Hurd, sales manager at The Residences at Dixon Mills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've had a nice pace, and we're outperforming the market," she says, adding that incentives such as a year of free maintenance help draw in first-time buyers.</p>

</div><div class="author">Christine Dugas </div><div>492 words</div><div>5 January 2010</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.2</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dutchess County and Poughkeepsie, N.Y., are still climbing out of the housing crisis, despite recent eye-popping home sales data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market has stayed a little more solid because Dutchess County is about an hour away from one of the largest cities in the Western Hemisphere," says Patrick Fleming, president of the Dutchess County Association of Realtors of New York. "But it took time to get into the housing mess, and it will take time to get out of it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In November, Dutchess County's home sales increased 55.1% from the same month in 2008. "The first-time home buyer tax credit helped spur a lot of people before they knew it was going to be extended," Fleming says. The housing market might settle down if the tax-credit home sales have peaked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. The median home price was 9.9% lower in November than it was a year earlier. Prices have been pulled down by short sales and foreclosed properties, which account for about 15% to 20% of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Anyone who wants to sell their home is competing with bank- owned properties that are priced more aggressively," Fleming says. "It may take another year to get the bulk of the foreclosure inventory soaked up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Poughkeepsie's unemployment rate was 7.9% in October, lower than the state's rate of 9.0%. The migratory flow of families to Dutchess County has imported higher wages, says Christy Caridi, director of the Bureau of Economic Research at Marist College.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The county also has a manufacturing industry, including an IBM plant in Poughkeepsie. Health care is a major employer, Caridi says. And the city is home to Marist and Vassar colleges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. In October, Poughkeepsie opened the Walkway Over the Hudson, a pedestrian bridge that was converted from a 1.25-mile- long railroad bridge. In the waterfront area, there are deluxe townhouses and condos that cost up to about $500,000. But nearby, there are also some affordable co-ops at about $75,000. "As the waterfront project ramps up, these will continue to rise in value," Fleming says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christmas will stretch into 2010 for apartment renters, who are benefiting from an epic collapse in the rental market and generous concessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords are offering tenants up to six months of free rent, flat-screen TVs and new appliances. They're also slashing monthly rates and easing application standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents fell a record 3.5% in 2009 after factoring in freebies, according to MPF Research. MPF projects prices will fall an additional 2% next year as an improving housing market and a tax credit for first-time home buyers attract more renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've been at this 35 years, and it's by far the worst I've seen it," says Jeff Cronrod of the American Apartment Owners Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, apartment vacancy is 7.8%, up from 4.8% at the end of 2007, says MPF Vice President Greg Willett.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The soft market is mostly rooted in the nation's 10% jobless rate. Tenants who lose their jobs are moving in with relatives or finding roommates, says economist Lawrence Yun of the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, homeowners who want to move but can't sell their houses because they're worth less than their mortgages are renting them out instead. So are investors who snapped up recently foreclosed houses and condos and are waiting for the market to rebound before unloading them. Those units boost supply and dampen prices, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among efforts to draw tenants:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In the Charleston, S.C., area, Darby Development, which manages about 1,600 apartments, is offering up to two months of free rent, flat-screen TVs and $100 gasoline gift cards to new tenants, says Victoria Cowart, head of property management. Existing tenants can get big discounts off the first month's rent in a new lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're just trying to be a little unique," she says, noting vacancy at the complexes exceeds 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Tampa and Orlando, Blue Rock Partners is haggling a bit with tenants, shaving rent to beat rivals, says managing partner Reuven Oded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Seattle, Trinity Partnership, owner of 1,000 apartments, built a 24-seat digital movie theater in a 99-unit building it opened in May to stand out in a tough market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In New York City, Viking Management is paying brokers' fees, typically equal to a month of rent, for new tenants, says manager Tom Caraccio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the efforts, more than 5% of tenants skip out without paying back rent vs. a typical 2%, says Bill Gray, who writes a blog, The Landlord Doctor. About 3.6% of landlords defaulted on their mortgages in the third quarter, up from 1.8% in late 2008, according to Real Estate Econometrics.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices were flat in October after rising five months in a row, but economists say the housing market at least has stabilized after a three-year free fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts, however, are split over whether prices will resume their climb or decline moderately again next year before mounting a more sustainable rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices were unchanged from September (not seasonally adjusted), according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price index, which tracks 20 large cities. Prices rose in seven of the 20 metro areas, down from nine in September and 18 last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, home prices are up 5.3% from their April low, partly on cheap mortgage rates and a tax credit for first-time home buyers that Congress extended to April 30 and expanded to existing homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Blitzer, who oversees the survey for <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>, says he's not surprised by the slowdown, noting the run-up was fueled by the stock market rally and pent-up demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We got a pretty good bounce in late spring and early summer, and it was coming a lot faster than people expected," Blitzer says. "Now it's settling down to a more sustainable pace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, prices rose in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, San Diego, Phoenix, Detroit and Portland, Ore. Homeowners are still beset by an epic real estate bust. Home prices in the 20 cities are down 29% from their peak in the second quarter of 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that year-over-year declines have eased steadily and dramatically this year. The average drop in home prices for the 20 cities in October vs. a year earlier was 7.3%, down from 9.4% in September and 19% in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists differ over what will happen in 2010. Patrick Newport of IHS Global Insight predicts values will fall an additional 5% to 10%. He cites a new wave of foreclosed homes that will drive up supply and the reduced impact of the tax credit. Most home buyers who wanted to take advantage of the credit did so before it was originally slated to expire Nov. 30, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors expects home values to rise 3% to 6% next year despite the fresh crop of foreclosed homes. He expects banks to ease tight lending standards that have limited sales of expensive homes. Meanwhile, unemployment will fall modestly, emboldening leery consumers, and the tax credit will spur more buyers as the April deadline nears, Naroff says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a closely watched index of consumer confidence rose to 52.9 in December, up from 50.6 the previous month and in line with analysts' estimates. The critical "expectations index," which measures consumers' short-term outlook, jumped from 70.3 to 75.6, its highest level in two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, 16.2% of consumers expect more jobs to become available in the next six months, up from 15.8% in November. The portion expecting fewer jobs fell to 20.7% from 23.1%. The overall index is up from its low of 25.3 in February but is still quite weak by historical standards.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DALLAS -- When the financial system collapsed last year, a short- handed <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. went looking for people schooled in the grim art of cleaning up failed banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least the FDIC knew just where to find the grizzled veterans: right here in the heart of Texas, where a banking cataclysm two decades ago wiped out more than 650 Texas banks and savings and loans. The FDIC has brought 44 of its own veterans out of retirement in Dallas alone -- far more retirees than it has reinstated from any other city -- to deal with an outbreak of bank failures across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been there and done that, and have the scars and bullet holes to prove it," says Steve Scurlock, a state bank regulator in the '80s and now executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of Texas. "I still wake up in cold sweats" thinking about the bad old days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's a twist: These days, the FDIC needs expertise from Texas, but not necessarily in Texas. Despite -- perhaps because of - - the financial wreckage in its past, Texas has escaped the worst of the current economic and financial maelstrom that has devastated states such as California, Nevada and Florida. "The recession's here, but it's nothing like it is in the rest of the country," says Texas Banking Commissioner Charles Cooper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Across the country, nearly 29% of subprime mortgages were at least 90 days late or in some stage of the foreclosure process in the third quarter. In Texas, the figure was less than 17%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Texas banks have stronger defenses against loan losses than banks nationwide. Their problem assets -- non-current loans plus real estate seized from delinquent borrowers -- are equal to just 17.2% of their defenses -- equity capital plus reserves against loan losses. Nationwide, the figure is 24%. In neighboring Arizona, where a real estate bubble burst, the figure is 51.2%. Anything over 100% indicates a bank is in danger of failing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Texas banks were five times as profitable as U.S. banks overall and were charging off bad loans at less than half the rate of banks nationwide during the third quarter, the FDIC says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Just five banks have failed in Texas this year, fewer than 4% of the 140 bank failures nationwide. From 1988 to 1991, Texas accounted for more than 37% of bank mortality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*The jobless rate in Texas was 8% in November -- painfully high but 2 percentage points below the national rate. "Our fundamentals are very strong," says Mine Yucel, senior economist at the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</span>. Forbes magazine recently rated Texas' economic climate No. 1 in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas certainly isn't immune to nationwide problems. The weak economy is pinching Texas employers, too. And Commissioner Cooper worries that bad commercial real estate loans could be "the next shoe that's dropping."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the Lone Star State seems to have dodged the subprime bullet -- and maintained a semblance of economic well-being -- in the midst of the worst downturn since the Great Depression. And that is a bit puzzling even to Texans themselves: "We're not smarter than everybody else," says Barton Smith, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's the explanation? Analysts offer three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sanity in mortgage market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas housing prices never touched the sun and never came crashing down. From January 2000 until they peaked in 2006 or 2007, the price of single-family homes rose 174% in Los Angeles, 181% in Miami, 135% in Las Vegas and 107% in 20 metropolitan areas tracked by the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices. In the Dallas-Fort Worth market, by contrast, home prices rose less than 27% before peaking in June 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Texas, supply and demand for housing remained more or less in balance while much of the rest of the country went topsy-turvy. Texas offers residential developers lots of wide-open spaces and imposes few restrictions on home building. So there's usually a plentiful supply of new housing to keep a lid on pricing -- and a plentiful supply of migrants, from other countries and other states, to absorb it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Texas really didn't have the run-up in the housing market," says Thomas Dujenski, director of bank supervision at the FDIC's Dallas regional office. "There wasn't the speculation" that occurred in other markets. And because prices never scaled ridiculous heights, lenders didn't need to come up with "exotic products" -- teaser rates, interest-only payment plans -- to fit home buyers into houses they couldn't afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, a lot of the stuff that got other places into trouble is illegal or severely restricted in Texas. Texas frowns, for instance, on home-equity loans. They weren't even legal there until 1997. Now, total mortgage debt -- including home-equity loans -- cannot exceed 80% of a home's value when the loans are made, and Texas homeowners cannot take out more than one home-equity loan at a time. In other states, "People were using their homes as piggy banks," says John Heasley, general counsel for the Texas Bankers Association. No such self-indulgence in Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the subprime mortgage market, Texas law also restricts balloon payments to no more than twice what borrowers had been paying earlier; bans most negative amortization loans (in which the loan balance grows as borrowers write checks because payments don't cover interest); and prohibits the prepayment penalties that elsewhere locked hapless home buyers into high-cost mortgages. And when Congress passed legislation regulating mortgage brokers in 2008, Texas and North Carolina were the only states already meeting the new law's national standards, according to Commissioner Doug Foster of the Texas Department of Savings and Mortgage Lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High energy prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peaking last year at $147 a barrel, high oil prices threw Texas a lifeline when the rest of the country was sinking into recession. The Texas economy isn't as dependent as it used to be on energy. Oil and gas production now accounts for about 6% of Texas' economic output, vs. almost 20% in 1981, according to the Dallas Fed. But Texas-based drilling companies get work around the world when energy prices are high. So an uptick in oil and gas prices can still help the state, sometimes working to delay or fend off recessions that hit the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas, for instance, escaped the 1990-1991 recession, partly because Texans benefited from the high energy prices that hurt everyone else. Same thing happened this time. Dallas Fed economist Yucel believes high energy prices bought Texas about a half-year reprieve: The recession that began in late 2007 elsewhere didn't reach Texas until mid-2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Battle scars</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've got a lot of veterans who went through the wars," says veteran Texan banker George Jones Jr. "I'm not saying we're smarter, but we're more experienced." What happened to Texas banks from 1985 to 1993 was nothing short of a financial massacre: 658 banks failed - - more than the 635 banks that still survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were done in by extraordinary events -- and by their own hubris. "Before the '80s, Texans thought they were invincible," says Joseph "Jody" Grant, a veteran Texas banker who lived through the crisis and later wrote a book about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil prices were surging -- hitting a peak of $30 a barrel in December 1985 -- and Texas' business elite went a little crazy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thinking: "Oil was selling at $30 a barrel, and it was going to $70, and it would never go below $30 again," Banking Commissioner Cooper recalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks stumbled over one another to finance speculative oil- exploration and real estate schemes. Dumping fuel on the fire: savings and loan associations. Traditionally humble mortgage lenders, S&amp;Ls were deregulated by Congress in 1982 and started throwing money around, financing commercial real estate projects. "There was mass hysteria," Grant says. "You couldn't fight it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An ordinary bank might finance a promising shopping center by a reputable developer on a busy street corner only to learn later that S&amp;Ls were financing identical projects on each of the three adjacent corners. "There was a saying that was popular in the Southwest and mainly Texas: God only made so much real estate," says former Texas banking commissioner Jim Sexton. Which might be true -- "but I seriously doubt He wanted it all developed in 1983."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, Saudi Arabia started pumping up the volume in oil production, and prices fell to $9.75 a barrel in April 1986. Result: catastrophe for Texas. When the smoke cleared, nine of Texas' 10 biggest banks were gone -- closed by banking regulators or sold to out-of-state institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the casualties: Texas American Bancshares, the Fort Worth banking company where Jody Grant was CEO. Grant left banking, spending time as CFO at <span class="companylink">Electronic Data Systems</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 1998 Grant returned to the industry, bringing along fellow veterans of what he calls "The Great Texas Banking Crash," including George Jones. They founded <span class="companylink">Texas Capital Bank</span> in Dallas. "We took the lessons from the past and put them to work," Grant says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting a second chance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas Capital was determined to do things right the second time around. It built a strong capital cushion against loan losses. Although it focuses on midsize ($10 million to $200 million in annual revenue) companies and wealthy individuals, it avoids concentrating loans in any one industry. It shied away from acquisitions, which burned Texas American back in the '80s. "You sell a little of your soul when you acquire," says C. Keith Cargill, president of <span class="companylink">Texas Capital Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of all, it resolved to defend its credit standards from pressures inside the bank and out. "You never compromise credit quality," Cargill says. At the banks that stumbled in the '80s, "You'd have one or two guys who had such strong personalities that they dominated credit" -- they could get the bank to cut corners to get deals done. Many other lenders paid loan officers for churning out loans and never penalized them if the loans went bad later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas Capital's Cargill built a compensation system that holds loan officers accountable for the loans they make. One year, the bank's top loan producer didn't get a bonus because some of his loans had soured. (The Federal Reserve has since proposed that banks rewrite compensation policies to ensure that they don't give employees incentives to take excessive risks.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other bankers learned similar lessons. "I don't think there's any replacement for experience," says Jimmy Campbell, CEO of Community Bank in Granbury, Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I learned to do much less speculative lending." Before the '80s crash, some banks would lend money to developers based on estimates of what a property would be worth a couple of years later or make loans on oil rigs based on optimistic forecasts of rising oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And remembering the destructive role of S&amp;Ls in the '80s, Texas bankers learned to say no the past few years to loans that were being approved by reckless mortgage lenders. "In my 40 years in this business, you've always got a juvenile delinquent down the street," says Dick Evans, CEO of <span class="companylink">Cullen/Frost Bankers</span>, the only big Texas bank that survived the meltdown of the 1980s and early '90s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the rest of the financial industry, Texas bankers learned that good times don't last forever. "When everybody thinks that we have somehow figured out how to repeal the business cycle, don't believe it," says former FDIC chairman William Isaac. "The time to be cautious is when everyone starts to believe the sun is always shining."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing bubble, the Medford, Ore., market expanded when many Californians rushed in to buy vacation and retirement homes. So it's no surprise that when the bubble burst, Medford and the county it's in, Jackson, saw falling prices and rising foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southern Oregon is typically six months behind California's housing market; Medford is finally climbing back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is obviously not a roaring market like it was in 2005 and 2006, but after having gone through the trough, I think the perception here is that sales have begun to turn around," says Steve Blanton, CEO of the Rogue Valley Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In November, Jackson County's home sales rose by an eye-popping 73% compared with the same month in 2008. "This surprised even us," Blanton says. The double-digit increase is related to a drop in home prices, stable interest rates and the first-time home buyer tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. The median home price has come down 20% to 30% since the boom. In November, the median price was 12.0% lower than it was a year ago. "That has brought people back into the market," Blanton says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are still being weighed down by foreclosures, although those have started to taper off. At the beginning of the year, about 50% of home sales in Jackson County were from foreclosures and short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region is ending the year with about 40% of sales from distressed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. The Medford unemployment rate was 11.4% in October, higher than the national average. But it has come down from its summer highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Medford is part of timber country and the logging industry, which has been hard hit economically, says Eric Fruits, president of the Portland consulting firm Economics International.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. The drop in home prices has made the popular rustic town of Jacksonville more affordable. Bank-owned properties are selling for 40% below the market price, says Graham Farran, real estate agent at Home Marketing Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jacksonville is a historic gold-rush town near Medford with many Victorian homes; it has been a set for Western movies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In 2010, it will celebrate its 150th birthday," says Jill Tompkins, a marketing director of AmeriTitle. "And it's the threshold to Applegate Valley and the wine industry."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- After three years of drought, Southern California is learning to go green by going brown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the semi-arid region that is home to more than 20 million people, restrictions on water use in homes and businesses imposed this year have produced a 15% savings, regional water officials say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leading the way has been Los Angeles itself, where a more than 18% reduction means the city will have used less water in 2009 than it did 25 years ago despite the addition of 1 million people in that time, according to the city's Department of Water and Power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The region has really responded," says Jeffrey Kightlinger, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the biggest water conservation results have come from residential customers, rather than business or industry, city figures show. The cost, for many residents, has been brown, dormant or dying grass lawns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We restricted watering the lawns -- that was the main saving measure," says David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since June, Los Angeles has permitted lawn sprinklers to run only on Mondays and Thursdays, for no more than 15 minutes a day, and never between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., when evaporation is greatest. The restrictions are enforced by more than a dozen "water police" who patrol for sprinkler scofflaws and follow tips by residents tattling on water-wasteful neighbors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those water cops have investigated 17,000 cases since June and issued more than 6,000 citations, L.A. water department spokeswoman Jane Galbraith says. Repeat offenders face fines of $100 to $600 and potentially could have their water shut off, she says. The city raised fees for customers whose monthly usage exceeds a fixed allotment based on historical use and family size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result has been a more than 23% reduction in water use by single-family homes here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Frankly, a lot of people pretty much gave up on keeping a green lawn all summer and kind of gave in to it," Freeman says. "There was no shortage of angry people."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Substitutes for grass</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight water supplies have sent some searching for more environmentally friendly alternatives to green grass -- such as no- water landscaping with gravel and cactus; low-water native plants such as rosemary, lilac and yuccas; and synthetic grass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Bagdon and Rick von Schrader, partners in a ForeverLawn business, have been ripping out brown grass and installing their proprietary brand of artificial lawns at homes ranging from multimillion-dollar mansions in Malibu and Pacific Palisades to more modest houses and apartments. Their green synthetic turf has replaced natural grass in public parks, fields and dog runs and around commercial buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business has been up 20% to 25% this year, von Schrader says, much of it driven by customers tired of the cost and hassles of watering under the new restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Half the time people say, 'I want to save on my water bill,' " Bagdon says. "It comes down to cost."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles soon may start paying some of the cost of replacing grass lawns. Freeman said his department is proposing that the City Council adopt a "cash for grass" program next year in which residents who rip out grass lawns for one of the drought-friendly alternatives will receive cash or rebates. Freeman said they have not decided on an amount, but he expects the incentive will exceed $1 per square foot of grass removed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has other restrictions. It's illegal to wash a car using a hose without a shut-off nozzle, to wash down hard-surfaced driveways and sidewalks or fail to repair a leaky pipe or fixture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restaurants are prohibited from serving glasses of water to customers unless they request it -- even though drinking water accounts for 1% or less of water consumption, Freeman says. "It's to bring it to people's attention," he says. "Obviously it's not to save that quantity of water."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone's happy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some say the restrictions go too far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greig Smith, an L.A. City Council member from the San Fernando Valley, calls the lawn watering limits "too draconian" and is proposing an ordinance allowing watering three days a week for a shorter time. He said he used that watering pattern on his own yard and kept it green -- though he was violating the city's limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My lawn is one of the greenest on the street. It worked," Smith says. "What prompted me was ... neighborhood after neighborhood looking really run down with bushes, lawns and flowers dying."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles and Southern California receive little rainfall most of the year and rely heavily on imports of water via aqueducts from the Owens Valley in eastern California, the Sierra Nevada through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, and the Colorado River</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of those sources is under pressure by drought, competing interests and in the case of the Delta, court-ordered restrictions on pumping for environmental protection reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each year has brought new limits on the amount of water available to Southern California from those sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even critics such as Smith acknowledge that forced conservation isn't ending anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We do live in a desert," he says. "We are going to have to live with this forever and be smart about it."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grand Forks, N.D., was bucking the trends when the housing market tumbled and the national economy collapsed. Some residents had a hard time comprehending what was going on across the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We haven't seen big fluctuations like some places have," says Mavis Winkels, president of the Grand Forks Board of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the bitter cold is not slowing the local economy: Visitors from Canada are filling the shopping malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It seems that every weekend, the mall and hotel parking lots are packed with Manitoba license plates," says David Flynn, director of the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of North Dakota.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In October, home sales were 5.2% higher than the same month in 2008. And in November, sales rose even higher, Winkels says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think that the first-time home buyer tax credit has kept our market going," she says. Because many first-time buyers thought the tax credit was about to expire, they rushed to take advantage of it last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Home prices have remained fairly stable. Grand Forks has not had a surge in home foreclosures, and it has not seen a glut of homes because of too much home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the surge in first-time home buyers, most of the recent home sales were in the lower price range. That caused the median home price to come down slightly. In October, the median price was down 0.1% compared with a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. In October, the unemployment rate was 3.5%, well below the national rate. In addition to a strong retail sector, the city is home to the Grand Forks Air Force Base and the University of North Dakota, which is a major employer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the national recession, the state of North Dakota has a budget surplus. "It has expanded spending and cut taxes," Flynn says. "It's been quite amazing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Renaissance zones have been created for the north and south sides of downtown Grand Forks to help preserve and improve historic properties. That creates appealing deals for first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For just around $90,000, they can buy homes that still need work, Winkels says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downtown area is particularly popular among young people because of the night life, she says. It is also easy to walk to stores and restaurants. In summer, there are farmers' markets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long maligned for smog, crime, heat and being, well, not cool, California city rolls up its sleeves to improve its reputation -- and it is starting with a push aimed at its own skeptical residents</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRESNO -- The hit animated comedy movie Monsters vs. Aliens this spring featured a husband trying to convince his wife that moving to Fresno was better than moving to Paris. The conversation was a running joke throughout the film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This fall, a Toyota Prius ad, which aired briefly before being pulled after vigorous complaints from the city, showed two people in a Prius in a future where "gas stations will become nothing more than low-budget tourist stops. Like ghost towns ... or Fresno."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, Fresno has been a punch line, a city maligned on the national stage for everything from its smog and crime, to its hot weather and reputation as a bastion of the un-hip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is fighting back, starting with a $1.2 million marketing campaign with the slogan: "Be World-Class. Be Fresno."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign, in part a response to the down economy that made promoting the city more important than ever, is geared toward creating a brand identity for the city for both business travelers and tourists, touting its proximity to national parks and its small- town atmosphere, says Jeff Eben, president of the Fresno City and County Convention and Visitors Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not telling our own story," he said. "We need to go fight."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research made it clear that local people had to be a target of the campaign, Eben said, as they had the lowest opinion of any group surveyed. So it was decided the first advertising buys would be in the Fresno market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've embarked on a campaign to convince people of what they have in their own backyards -- and to feel better about themselves," said Al Smith, president of the Greater Fresno Area Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later campaigns will focus on the Pacific Northwest and other cold climates, marketing the region as "California's year-round playground," Smith said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some residents are skeptical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Fresno's just an average, middle-class town," said Stefanie Yamada, 35, a stay-at-home mom. "There's really nothing special about it -- but, then again, most people live in places like this."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long a struggle</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first time Fresno came out on the bottom of a quality-of- life survey in 1984 by Places Rated Almanac, the city's mayor was booked to explain on Late Night With David Letterman. The city had ranked near the bottom before, but not at the very bottom, then- mayor Dan Whitehurst said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So how hot does it get?" Letterman asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whitehurst smiled. "It seldom gets over 120." He jokingly touted the city's "first-in-the-nation leisure-suit control laws."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fun didn't last long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the city has repeatedly drawn unwanted national attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* In 2003, Forbes magazine deemed the city an "Economic Death Valley," ranking it 146 out of 150 on its "Best Places to Do Business" list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* In 2005, a Brookings Institution study found that Fresno had the highest concentration of poverty in the USA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* In September of this year, the region's poor air quality, low test scores and a lack of parks led Children's Health magazine to rank it as one of the worst three cities in the nation to raise a child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in the middle of California's agricultural Central Valley -- local farms produced $5.6 billion in grapes, almonds, poultry, milk and other products in 2008, according to Fresno County's crop report -- Fresno has always had a hard time finding its identity, said William Rice, a marketing professor at the Sid Craig School of Business at California State University-Fresno.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've never really positioned ourselves as anything," Rice said. "I think most people just see us as a wide spot in the road."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresno is within 90 minutes of Yosemite, Kings Canyon and Sequoia national parks and three-hour drives from Los Angeles, San Francisco and California's Central Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's $1.08-billion-a-year tourist industry is largely based on moderate prices for business conferences and people stopping by on the way to somewhere else, Eben said. Its issues with unemployment, sinking home values and air quality also exist in surrounding cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Forbes named Long Beach -- a city 244 miles away and about the same size as Fresno -- No. 2 on its list of "America's Most Stressful Cities." Chicago was No. 1. Sacramento, also about the same size and 196 miles to the north, was No. 15 on that list. This was one list Fresno did not make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresno has tried to fight back before. In 2006, the city spent $120,000 on a public relations campaign to pitch stories about the city's low cost of living and its proximity to three national parks. The contract was canceled after one year, said Travis Sheridan, a former director with Astone, the public relations firm that worked on the Fresno campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were mixed results," he said. "We wanted to pitch stories that were novel and exciting -- and everyone had a different idea of what 'novel and exciting' was."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been a flurry of other slogans and branding efforts, including "Fresno: Smile when you say that" (2000) and "Fresno: The New Frontier" (2004).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the jokes haven't stopped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tough economy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to recent economic indicators, there's not a lot to laugh about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's unemployment rate is 14.5%, according to California State Employment Development Department data from January to October, while the statewide average for the same period was 11.5%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for homes in the city has fallen by 39.2% since the peak of the real estate boom in October 2005, from $282,500 to $172,000, according to the California Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has persistent issues with crime and gangs. According to the city's gang task force, there are 220 known street gangs and 7,724 documented gang members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some statistics seem to be moving in the right direction: Fresno recorded 40 homicides in 2008, down from 52 in 2007, according to city crime statistics. But there have been 40 homicides in the city this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresno Mayor Ashley Swearengin said all the surveys and jokes are "in no way a reflection of what is really happening in Fresno."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two positives she pointed to: The area has stepped up efforts to clean up its air quality, and the new University of California campus in nearby Merced may help draw more professional opportunities to the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are some very serious issues in the Valley, and they are being recognized," Whitehurst said. "Let's not get defensive and focus on labels. Instead, let's focus on making this a better city."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it weren't for Dartmouth College, Hanover, N.H., "would just be another little New England town," says Shelley Gilbert, a top saleswoman at Hanover's Coldwell Banker-Redpath &amp; Co. Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Ivy League school, among the nation's oldest, has been here since 1769. And in many ways, Hanover, population about 11,000, is the quintessential college community. Centuries-old college buildings, an arts complex and the library surround a large town green. South Main Street is lined with coffee shops, eateries and the college bookstore, and students are everywhere, all year long, because Dartmouth requires undergraduates to take a summer term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Second-home buyers, and there are a lot, are either alumni or people who figure an Ivy League school adds something to the community," Gilbert says. "There's all the culture you could want. Every night you could be going to see the ballet, theater, art films, music. You can attend lectures, audit classes, become a hockey fan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But we also have incredible access to the outdoors. We're surrounded by protected land; there is great trail access, snowshoeing, skiing and paddling. I see a lot of couples where one is very outdoorsy and the other is into the cultural aspects, and they can both be happy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Appalachian Trail runs right through downtown, and the town sits on the Connecticut River, a favorite for canoeists. Dartmouth has its own golf course, canoe club and alpine and Nordic ski areas, all open to the public. (Thanks to the close proximity of the Green and White mountains, several of the East's largest ski resorts, including Ascutney Mountain, Killington, Mount Sunapee and Okemo, are within an hour's drive.) Not coincidentally, Dartmouth has the oldest collegiate outing club in the USA, and anyone can join and participate in its outdoor adventures and clinics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the college, along with its medical, business and engineering schools and huge hospital, add to the area's cultural offerings, they also employ thousands and make prices in the region higher than other rural New England towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEXT OF INFO BOXES BEGINS HERE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at three Hanover-area neighborhoods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In-town Hanover: The downtown area is ultra-desirable because so much is within walking distance, including shops, restaurants, the football stadium and other athletic facilities. "Defined by walkability, it's a market unto itself," says real-estate agent Shelley Gilbert. "In the past few months we've sold an unusual number of million-plus homes, and one of the highest priced, $1.7 million, was a second home." Downtown is mostly single-family houses, from $650,000 to $2 million, according to Gilbert, and the few condos available, from about $300,000, are very popular with second-home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Etna, Hanover Center and Lyme: These three communities, some part of the town of Hanover, have small village cores, are 10-20 minutes away, and are the top choices for those seeking a rural experience. "Just outside walking distance, you hit a belt of suburbia, and prices drop, but then it becomes rural and they go back up," Gilbert says. "A second-home owner would rarely buy in the ring in between. They either want in-town or rural with acreage. Outside town, the view is the biggest price determinant." Overall, prices run 25%-40% less than in town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Strafford, Vt.: About 20 minutes away, this charming small town (population about 1,100) has a bit of a cult following, and Gilbert has sold several second homes. The old Meeting House on the town green is a Vermont icon and one of the most photographed buildings in New England. "It has this mystique, a great little town with a lot of spirit, there are readings, the July Fourth parade and so on." The market is entirely single-family houses, and she says Strafford prices for second homes start at around $500,000.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home buyers are downsizing ; Builders find that smaller homes are selling well these days</span>
</div><div class="author">Stephanie Armour  </div><div>825 words</div><div>17 December 2009</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.3</div><div>English</div><div>© 2009 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out of the depths of housing's worst downturn, smaller new homes are turning into a bright spot for some home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend toward more compact new homes is being driven partly by the fact that more customers are first-time buyers who have less to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are responding by offering smaller designs with features such as high ceilings and large windows that create a spacious feel and options that let buyers personalize the model they choose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KB Home</span>'s smaller model helped it achieve a 62% increase in year- over-year net orders in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend cuts across the industry. The median square footage of new homes has dropped 9% from a peak of 2,300 square feet in the third quarter of 2006 to 2,100 square feet in the July-September period this year, according to data from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing size drops with each recession, but economists expect the current movement toward smaller homes to continue for some time in part because of the severity of the current housing market slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers are driving the trend toward smaller homes because that is what they can afford, says David Crowe, chief economist at the NAHB.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the economy improves, move-up buyers generally enter the market and begin buying larger homes. But this time, so many homeowners owe more on their homes than their properties are worth that many potential move-up buyers will be stuck even as the economy strengthens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means first-time home buyers will still be buying smaller homes while larger homes will find fewer buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This downsizing is more sustainable," Crowe says. "The first- time buyer will continue to be a large part of the market because the move-up buyer will not have as much equity. It's going to take them awhile to climb out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAHB doesn't keep data on the percentage of new home sales that are made by first-time home buyers, but about half of all home purchasers were first-time buyers in October, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For builders, smaller, less-expensive homes mean less profit. But the industry is already facing strong competition from a high supply of foreclosed homes selling at comparatively low prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A welcome change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts say the downsizing trend could be good news for builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The appetite for smaller homes may be a welcome change for home builders as new home sales have been challenged in the past few years," says Tom Lydon, editor of ETF Trends, which educates investors on fund choices and market trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major home builders such as <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> and <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span> are responding to the shift in demand by offering more of the smaller properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span>, its most popular designs today are 100 to 200 square feet less than the most-popular plans in 2005-06.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the lower-priced homes don't seem bare-bones to buyers, open floor plans and 9-foot ceilings provide a sense of roominess. Fireplaces are an option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To hold down costs, Corian -- a surfacing material created by DuPont -- is a standard for kitchen counters instead of granite. Appliances are standard models instead of pricier stainless steel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not just making it smaller, it's maximizing the space in the home," says Caryn Klebba, a spokeswoman at <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span>. "It's a 9- or 10-foot ceiling rather than a cathedral ceiling." Cathedral ceilings are 14 to 18 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getaway option</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller homes also are appealing as vacation homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nancy Coronado, 55, a retired framer in an art gallery, has a large home in Whitehall, Mich., and bought a second Pulte home in Florence, Ariz., in March. The new home is about 1,400 square feet. "I have a big home in Michigan and didn't want another big home," she says. "I wasn't looking for that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KB Home</span> also has redesigned its homes to reflect the trend, because nearly 80% of its customers are first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Bros</span>., which builds luxury homes, says demand is down across the board, and not just for larger homes. Company officials say they, too, see an increased interest in smaller homes but believe that home buyers will someday return to wanting larger properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller homes, they say, reflect a down economy and tighter credit rather than an appetite for less space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We see the demand for smaller homes, but it's not as though there's huge demand for smaller homes but no demand for larger homes," says Kira McCarron, a spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">Toll Bros</span>. "There is still a demand for luxury homes."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the race for housing stability and prosperity, Baton Rouge has not only had to dodge the recession but also a handful of hurricanes over the past few years. Even so, it seems to be coming out ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been the tortoise," says Sandy Daly, president of the Greater Baton Rouge Association of Realtors. "We didn't participate in the speculative real estate bubble, so we're not experiencing the burst."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was only after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 that Baton Rouge experienced somewhat of a surge in construction and home prices. Last year, though, when the stock market collapsed and Hurricane Gustav slammed into the Gulf Coast, the housing market spiraled down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We got through that, and now things are beginning to come back," Daly says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. In October, home sales were 2% higher than the same month last year. The first-time home buyer tax credit has been a catalyst. This year, first-time buyers accounted for 40% to 45% of sales, Daly says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. The first-time buyers have focused on the market's low end. With high-end homes selling more slowly, the median price in October was just 1.3% higher than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Baton Rouge almost escaped the recession. "Historically, it always hits us a little later, and we get hit much lighter than the rest of the nation," says Loren Scott, a Baton Rouge economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, the area's unemployment rate was 6.8%, compared with the state rate of 7.4% and the national rate of 10.2%. In part, that's because Baton Rouge's chemical firms and petroleum refineries provide steady employment. And the area also benefited from legislation passed to rebuild after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is an unusual amount of construction going on," Scott says. "Much of it is building new plants that are hiring more people."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Until recently, Capital Heights, a historic neighborhood, was not very desirable and was dominated by rentals. But a non-profit association is helping revitalize Mid City, a region that includes Capital Heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood is popular because it is close to shops, restaurants and grocery stores. And the city recently changed the main avenue to one-way and added walking and biking paths, says Carrie Broussard, economic development manager for Mid-City Redevelopment Alliance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now many small bungalows and cottages are being purchased and getting some attention. Homes that have not yet been fixed up may cost as little as $90,000, says Marge Mackey, owner of Coldwell Banker Mackey.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What could spark a correction?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rogers: As we've seen over the years, left-field events can come out of nowhere to surprise us. I'm sure we will see some of that next year. Whether it is a double-dip recession, or something crazy going on in the Middle East, there will be scary things that will shake investor confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some pundits say the liquidity-driven rally will end badly. Why all the angst?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tice: We have so many risks. Look at the third-quarter GDP growth of 2.8%. (Nearly all of that) came from the government stimulus package, cash for clunkers, etc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We still have one in seven Americans with a mortgage either in foreclosure or in arrears. We have one in six Americans either unemployed or working part time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit is still tightening. Things are bad in America. We created a debt bubble. The economy grew because people used their houses as ATMs. We responded to this crisis by adding a spectacular amount of new debt in the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cohen: I am concerned about the fiscal situation at the state and local level. State and local governments don't have the ability that the federal government does to run deficits for more than one year, and that is why you see the rubber hitting the road right now in a variety of states, including Michigan and California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think that this is going to be one of the big issues from both a consumer and political standpoint in 2010. States will have to either raise taxes or reduce spending. (That may force them to) fire workers, such as public-safety employees, teachers and construction workers who get put to work on infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David, what worries you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bianco: The biggest threat to the U.S. economy -- one that might set the falling dominoes back in motion again -- is a surge in interest rates, either from a dollar crisis, massive deficit concerns related to certain legislation and entitlement considerations, or some kind of (negative) credit event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What other obstacles do stocks face?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rogers: One obstacle will be if the economy does not rebound at a pace that allows for enough earnings growth. 2009 was about restoring stability in the system. Next year will be all about earnings. If earnings don't pick up, that will be a big deal. Secondly, if there is some renewed fragility in the financial sector globally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chung: One thing I am concerned about is what we just saw with the Dubai World debt scare. It shouldn't have been that surprising given how much they overinvested in real estate, but it is a potential shot across the bow for an even bigger sovereign bond problem or refinancing issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why would a spike in rates hurt?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bianco: It would cause real estate prices -- commercial and residential -- to come back under pressure. It would make it difficult for households to weather their current debt levels and put strains back on the banking system. Low interest rates are the biggest and most effective part of the stimulus so far. They are what is stabilizing the economy. Take that away and you could have trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What else worries you, Abby?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cohen: Things are not as clear for global policymakers. Last year the central bankers, finance ministers, Treasury secretaries, all knew what they had to do: get the liquidity flowing and provide the stimulus. Now we're going to see divergent paths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tice: The big risk is the health of the U.S. economy. With so many Americans unemployed I don't see the U.S. economy snapping back and worry corporate earnings won't come through.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With trillions of dollars in cheap money sloshing around world financial markets as a result of stimulus packages and bailouts, and short-term interest rates around 0%, there is growing talk about new bubbles forming. In the past 10 years, the tech-stock bubble burst, as did the bubblicious housing and mortgage market. What potential, emphasis on potential, bubbles are out there? We list three, but bubbles may also be brewing in junk bonds, commercial real estate and emerging markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*China. If there is a nation living on a sugar rush of stimulus and megagrowth, it is China. "It's an area of excessive activity," says Brian Rogers of <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price</span>. Lax lending and massive overinvestment in real estate and commercial buildings spell trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lots of trouble, warns David Tice of Federated Investors. Citing an estimate from another prominent bear, he says the bubble brewing in China could be a thousand times bigger than the recent $60 billion Dubai World debt crisis: "There is capital spending for big office buildings that lie completely vacant. There are some real problems there to come."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Gold. An ounce recently fetched more than $1,200, a record. Investors are piling into gold-specific exchange traded funds, and central banks around the globe are again buying gold. All this activity is worrisome and points to excess, Rogers says. Adds David Bianco of <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, "I think gold is an expensive insurance policy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tice has a contrarian take: Gold, he says, could hit $3,000 an ounce in coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*U.S. Treasury bonds. Short-duration government bonds yield about 0% and the 10-year note 3.55%. Yields are at or near historic lows. That's not going to last, warns Tice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Frankly," says Tice, "with interest rates where they are, coupled with the massive debt we are taking on, I don't think there is any way that fixed-income yields should be as low as they are. Rates are going to have to go a lot higher."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adds Abby Joseph Cohen of <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, "Treasuries could suffer a sell-off even if it has nothing to do with the currency (i.e., a weak U.S. dollar), but rather something to do with interest rates not properly reflecting the inflation outlook." Inflation expectations are benign because of the weakened state of consumers and the economy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colleen Wells heard the housing market was supposed to be picking up, so she felt optimistic when she put her 60-acre farm in Ocala, Fla., up for sale early this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When no one bought the farm at its asking price of $894,000, she slashed the price to $699,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it's been more than 11 months, and she still hasn't found a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nothing seems to be selling right now," Wells says. "There just hasn't been a whole lot of interest."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stories such as Wells' are a reminder that although the housing market has shown signs of improvement lately, the recovery may not be on firm ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year is ending on a brighter note than it began. Sales of existing homes are running at the highest pace in more than two years. Inventory of unsold homes is the lowest in more than a year. And home prices are falling at a much slower pace than they were this time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists caution that a good part of the improvement is tied to government assistance -- low interest rates that stem from the Federal Reserve's heavy buying of mortgage securities and a tax credit worth up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers. That credit has been extended and expanded to include some repeat home buyers for 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a still-weak economy and unemployment at 10%, the question is whether housing can rebound from its worst downturn since the Great Depression without the government propping it up. The Fed's $1.25 trillion securities-buying program is scheduled to end early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now, we're not in a sustaining recovery," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors (NAR). "We're on the cusp of a self-sufficient recovery, but we're not there yet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy .com, predicts the housing market will get a little worse before it gets better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median existing home prices already are down nearly 30% from their peak in 2005, and Zandi sees them falling further next year. He forecasts prices skidding to a bottom next year and slowly returning to last quarter's national median price of $170,700 -- in 2012. Meanwhile, foreclosures will climb to 1.9 million in 2010, outpacing 2009's expected total by 200,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Foreclosures will be high for a long time," Zandi says. "And property values won't increase."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all economists are seeing such a bleak outlook for the housing recovery, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Bethune at IHS Global Insight says prices may rise slightly over the next year or two, then more rapidly after that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the next one to two years, there will be little movement on prices, but then a very tight supply will happen," Bethune says. "Then at some point in the future, prices will probably jump, maybe in 2012. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> is probably somewhat pessimistic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of housing's recovery is hard to predict because so much depends on other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, average interest rates for a fixed, 30-year mortgage have hovered around 5% much of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates could send a chill through the housing market by scaring off potential buyers, further depressing housing sales and prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another wild card is unemployment. The Federal Reserve forecasts unemployment will remain well above 9% a year from now and higher than 8% in 2011. As more Americans lose paychecks, many will fall behind on their mortgages, adding to foreclosures and dragging down home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'So much inventory'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many parts of the country, home prices are so far below their peaks that millions of homeowners will owe more on their homes than they're worth for years to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are continuing to drop. The median home price in the fourth quarter of 2009 is estimated to fall to $159,000, down from $170,000 in the third quarter of the year, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It forecasts the median price bottoming at $146,500 in the third quarter of 2010 before beginning to turn around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the metro areas showing price drops is the Boston area, which is projected to decline from a median price of $309,000 in the fourth quarter of 2009 to a bottom of $303,000 in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Las Vegas area, which has already been hit hard by foreclosures, should fall from a median price of $120,000 in the fourth quarter of this year, reaching a bottom of $102,000 next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York and its surrounding area are expected to drop from a median price of $390,000 in the fourth quarter of 2009 to a bottom of $341,000 in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's bad news for Ruta Fox, who has been trying to sell her one- bedroom apartment in New York City since March. She lowered her $685,000 asking price to $655,000 and received only one offer, $105,000 below her listing price, but the deal fell through. She has since lowered the asking price to $610,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She hadn't expected it would be so hard to sell the apartment, with its French doors, hardwood floors and ideal location near Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is just so much inventory in this market," Fox says. "It's a tough market right now. I'm trying to stay positive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some promising signs: The pace of home price declines is slowing. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index, which tracks 20 major metro markets, shows an improvement in the rate of price declines, according to data through September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists say they believe home prices nationally are actually going to rise. Yun, the NAR economist, says that a steady decline in housing inventory means home prices should increase 3% to 5% in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Realtors say they're seeing business pick up and, in some isolated cases, they're even seeing higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Multiple offers are back, and with that you're seeing higher prices, but they're not runaway like they used to be. That's good," says Stacey Glover, a Realtor at Zip Realty in Vienna, Va., a suburb of Washington, D.C., an area where prices have held up better than in some other metro areas. "Some of my sellers are surprised at how fast houses are going."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start of a turnaround?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are rising because of bargain-basement prices, historically low interest rates and stimulus efforts such as tax credits for first-time and move-up buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new and existing homes are projected to rise from an annual rate of 5.4 million homes in the fourth quarter of 2009 to more than 6 million throughout 2010, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. By the fourth quarter of 2012, sales are forecast to be at 6.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data support the trend toward a rise in existing home sales. Sales of existing homes surged 10% to an annual rate of 6.1 million units in October from 5.5 million units in September, according to NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers are buying about 30% of homes, and foreclosed and other so-called distressed homes accounted for about 30% of transactions. Many of these buyers are being drawn in by historically low interest rates and a first-time home buyers tax credit of up to $8,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're also buyers like Brad and Heidi Kroft, who decided this fall to sell their brick ranch home in Indianapolis to purchase a larger place. They'd heard the housing market was improving but never expected this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took just eight days for the three-bedroom home to sell in September, and it went for $147,650 -- about $20,000 more than they'd paid for it five years ago. "We're convinced," Heidi says, "that the market is starting to turn."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Indianapolis area, median home prices reached $124,000 in the first quarter of 2005 and fell to $99,000 in the third quarter of 2009, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. Prices are forecast to climb to $103,000 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and largely keep accelerating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer new homes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2006, the housing market has been plagued by a glut of homes languishing on the market -- a bloated inventory that has helped drive housing prices down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is starting to shift, but inventory is still above the threshold considered ideal for a healthy housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family homes available for sale fell to an estimated seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 2.7 million homes in the fourth quarter, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. That's expected to shrink to 2.6 million in the first quarter of 2010 and continue falling, reaching 2.3 million in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The faster inventory shrinks, the less time homes for sale will stay on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The trend has been downward for the past 13 months," says Walter Maloney, an NAR spokesman. "We have seen a correlation between the months supply (of homes) and how many weeks homes are on the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason inventories are falling: Far fewer homes are being built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single- and multifamily housing starts hovered at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 600,000 in the fourth quarter and are projected to climb to 720,000 in the second quarter of 2010, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compare that with the housing peak, when starts ran at an annual rate of 2.12 million in the first quarter of 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts are expected to reach an annual rate of 1 million in the second quarter of 2011 and 1.86 million by 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders say they're optimistic that demand will eventually pick up again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, companywide orders increased 62% in the third quarter to 2,158, up from 1,329 in the third quarter of 2008. KB's backlog as of Aug. 31 totaled 3,722 homes, representing potential future housing revenue of about $734 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In many cities, we're seeing inventories (of unsold homes) down. We're cautiously optimistic," says Jeff Mezger, CEO of <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>. "We're very positive in the long term."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foreclosure problem</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the short run, though, the nation's foreclosure crisis is likely to be another drag on the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unprecedented 16 million homeowners -- about one-third of those with a first mortgage -- are underwater, owing more than their homes are now worth, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy .com. Growing numbers of borrowers who have lost their equity are walking away from their mortgage and their home, increasing the number of properties returning to lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Default rates tend to rise for homeowners whose so-called negative equity is deepest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many are underwater and are at high risk of defaulting," Zandi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zandi expects mortgage defaults to peak this year but remain well above the levels earlier this decade through 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year is expected to bring a total of 1.7 million foreclosure sales. That number swells after accounting for actions to head off foreclosures, such as short sales and "deeds in lieu" of foreclosure, that also force borrowers out of their homes. A short sale means selling a home for less than the unpaid mortgage, while deed in lieu means the borrower turns the deed over to the lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In total, there will be 2 million homes lost to foreclosure, deeds in lieu of foreclosure or short sales in 2009, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. That number is forecast to rise to 2.4 million in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2012, the number of homes lost should taper off to 662,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a lot of foreclosed properties in the pipeline that will limit the market and depress prices," Zandi says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market in Fresno is still fraught with foreclosures, posting the nation's 15th-highest rate in the third quarter, according to RealtyTrac.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means the market there is saturated with available homes, right? Not quite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have plenty of demand, but we just don't have enough inventory," says Jared Martin, president of the Fresno Association of Realtors. "I'm receiving multiple offers on a property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. If demand is up, why were home sales down 2.4% in October, compared with the same month a year ago? And if the foreclosure rate in Fresno is high, why is inventory lacking?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin has an opinion: "I think that banks are controlling the inventory much more tightly than they were a year ago," he says, resulting in fewer sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Foreclosures and short sales have brought down prices. The median price in October, $152,840, was 12.4% lower than it was a year ago. But the multiple offers have caused prices to rise this year. The lowest median price came in February, at about $128,000, Martin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. The October preliminary unemployment rate in Fresno County was 15.8%, higher than the state's 12.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresno is mostly an agricultural area, but farmers have been laying off workers because there is not enough water for crops, says Antonio Avalos, chairman of the economics department at California State University in Fresno. And the construction industry has been hurt by foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hood. More families can afford a home in the Tower District, where the architecture ranges from grand Victorians to smaller Craftsman bungalows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the most part, homes were built from the 1920s through the 1940s, and they have charm and character," says Mel Kilner, real estate agent at <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span>. The neighborhood, where many homes are historic properties, has long been desirable but not affordable. But now, prices are a bargain.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates fell to a historic low this week, spurring mortgage applications and possibly home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 30-year-average dropped to 4.71% from 4.78% a week ago, mortgage finance giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday. That is the lowest since the agency began compiling its weekly survey in 1971.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rates have been relatively low much of the year because of the Federal Reserve's heavy buying of mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That $1.25 trillion program was designed to push money into the housing market, but it is scheduled to end next spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 5.53%, but <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> has reported national average 30-year rates at or below 5% in 21 weekly surveys this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average 15-year fixed rate was 4.27%, down from 4.29% a week earlier, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s survey found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attractive as the rates may be, many home buyers may not qualify for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders have raised credit standards since last year, requiring much higher credit scores and larger down payments of up to 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, under-5% mortgage rates are touching off interest among home buyers across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage loan applications during Thanksgiving week increased 2.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis from one week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing a little bit of a frenzy," says Diann Patton, a broker and national consumer spokeswoman with Coldwell Banker in Grass Valley, Calif. "We're seeing people wanting to lock in rates immediately. If rates stay low, I think we'll pull out of this in 2010."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Gould, 34, is now in the midst of closing on a house in Berkeley, Calif. He recently locked in at 4.75% for 30 years with no points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I didn't want to miss this historic opportunity," Gould says. "My uncle reminded me that he bought a house in 1978 for 13% interest. The rates are so low. That's driven the decision to buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to low rates, a federal tax credit of up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers has helped drive home sales recently. The credit was recently extended and expanded to some existing homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales surged 10.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.10 million units in October from September, the National Association of Realtors said last week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite being more than 50 miles from Denver, the Winter Park ski resort is actually part of the city. Back in 1939, city officials bought the mountain, located west toward the Rockies, so Denver residents would have a local place to ski.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although ranked in the nation's top 10, the mountain never made much money from the Denver day-trippers. Without private investment, facilities were tired and the area lacked resort amenities such as hotels, retail and dining. So in 2002, the city partnered with ski operator Intrawest, which has invested more than $50 million in on- mountain skier improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bigger change is the new pedestrian base village, with condo hotels, restaurants and shops. Now Winter Park -- which had only 230 condos in 2000 -- has base-area condos for sale, and more on the way, at prices lower than most Western competitors. The average home price of $450,000 in Grand County is nearly half of nearby Summit County (where Breckenridge, Copper and Keystone are located) and even less compared with Eagle County (home to upscale Vail, Beaver Creek).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These dramatic changes also have spurred development in downtown Winter Park, 2 miles away, and for 30 more miles up the road, as the popularity of the resort -- the closest large mountain to Denver and its airport -- has grown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Customers coming to the valley now are expecting more in the way of nightlife and restaurants -- and they are getting it," says Realtor Lance Gutersohn of ReMax Peak to Peak. Gutersohn estimates that more than 90% of residential real estate built in the past decade are second homes, and several new communities are a direct result of the base-village expansion. The ski resort itself has approvals for 1,300 more residences and, should it get too crowded, for another entire mountain also owned by Denver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEXT OF INFO BOXES BEGINS HERE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at three Winter Park neighborhoods:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Slopeside Village: New condos are in two hotel-style complexes and in luxury lofts above the new retail and dining storefronts in the pedestrian village. Since there are no hotels at Winter Park, these can be rented out through the resort to generate income. Two- bedroom condos start at around $350,000, and the lofts cost about $670,000. In older buildings, studio condos begin under $150,000. The most luxurious options are the custom homes in Bridger's Cache, averaging about $3 million. (lovewinterpark.com)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Town of Winter Park: Two miles from the ski area, Winter Park has a store- and restaurant-lined Main Street and numerous condos and single-family houses. The most notable is Grand Park, a 1,700- acre community at the northern end of town with its own village underway. A new four-bedroom house meeting Colorado's "Built Green" certification costs $549,000. (grandparkco.com)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Granby Ranch: This 5,000-acre golf and ski community is 15 miles north in the Highway 40 development corridor. Granby Park has its own small (33 trails) ski resort, SolVista Basin, and many residents use both the skiing here and Winter Park. Slopeside condos start at under $200,000, and lots for new houses can be found in the mid- $100,000s. (granbyranch.com)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who have called it home are fighting a plan to</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">redevelop Lathrop Homes. 'This place is too beautiful to be destroyed,' they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHICAGO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betty Howard moved to Lathrop Homes with her family on a beautiful autumn day in the 1960s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everything was golden," she recalls. Her father had waxed the floors of their new apartment until they gleamed "like mirrors." Outside, there were lots of kids to play with, trees and playgrounds. "It was paradise," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her family wasn't moving into an upscale development. A sofa and a couple of mattresses were the only furniture they owned. They were relocating from Cabrini Green, one of the city's most foreboding and dangerous public housing developments, to another public housing unit at Lathrop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard, 60, lived at Lathrop for 10 years; her mother stayed until her death in 1986. Now Howard is among current and former residents trying to prevent the demolition and redevelopment of Lathrop as the Chicago Housing Authority continues a decade-old, $5 billion plan to replace projects with communities that blend public housing, affordable housing and market-rate condos and rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work at Lathrop will begin next year, says William Little, executive vice president of development for the Housing Authority. The complex's 27 low-rise brick buildings, which opened in 1938, will be rehabilitated or torn down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lathrop's population has been shrinking in anticipation of redevelopment, and the campuslike area abutting the Chicago River has a vacant feeling. Of 924 units, 217 are occupied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lewis Jordan, CEO of the Chicago Housing Authority, says a third of the units at a redeveloped Lathrop will be for public housing. He says the changes will integrate the area into the surrounding neighborhood, benefiting both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not just in the housing business; I'm in the revitalizing neighborhoods business," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As new mixed-income developments replace infamous former projects such as Robert Taylor Homes, Jordan says, people still in the city's remaining public housing projects are telling the Housing Authority, "We don't want to live here anymore."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some Lathrop residents defy the stereotype that public housing is a place from which people can't wait to escape. "This place is too beautiful to be destroyed," says Sondra Cornwell, 61, who had been homeless for 2 1/2 years when she moved to Lathrop more than two decades ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a home. This is not a 'project,' " says Ruby Mann-Kane, 47, a co-chairwoman of the Leadership Team, which has an alternative proposal that would retain much of Lathrop's public housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Change is scary, and nobody likes it'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reluctance of Lathrop residents isn't unusual, says Susan Popkin, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who has studied Chicago public housing for more than 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Change is scary, and nobody likes it," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research shows that most people who leave public housing end up in better housing and have lower levels of anxiety and depression, Popkin says, but their employment and educational situations improve less often.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than a decade, housing authorities across the nation have been tearing down big public housing projects, replacing them with mixed-income developments and vouchers that subsidize low- income families' rent in private housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal is to end the projects' physical and social isolation and "reintegrate public housing into the landscape of surrounding neighborhoods," says Sandra Henriquez, assistant secretary of the Housing and Urban Development for public housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1988, 196,000 public housing units across the country have been demolished, HUD says, and 239,000 more approved for demolition. Since 1993, 80,000 replacement units have been built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chicago, about 17,000 public housing units -- almost 70% of those targeted for demolition a decade ago -- have been rehabbed or replaced so far, the Housing Authority says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift away from massive public housing projects has been met with some resistance here and in such cities as Atlanta and New Orleans. Some public housing residents and their advocates say it has forced them to struggle to find affordable housing and uprooted them from long-standing communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Breaking the cycle</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The irony is that public housing is actually more cohesive and more secure for families than non-public housing in big cities," says Sudhir Venkatesh, a sociology professor at Columbia University in New York City who studies urban neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He studied former residents of Chicago public housing and found that most ended up in poor, segregated black communities. Most want to move back into public housing projects, Venkatesh says, "because they offered a sense of community and a set of resources that private landlords just never offer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Lundy, executive director and CEO of the Huntsville, Ala., Housing Authority, says public housing is counterproductive if it allows generations of families to stay in projects and stay poor. "We have to break the cycle, he says."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Huntsville replaces some of its 1,700 public housing units with mixed-income developments and some residents move elsewhere, Lundy says, they will adjust and benefit from exposure to different lifestyles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It happened to him, he says, when his family left the Cincinnati housing project where he lived until he was in his teens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My whole life changed," he says. "Somebody had to cut the grass, shovel snow, plant flowers. ... I had different role models."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foundation for solutions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lathrop loyalists held a reunion of current and former residents in October that drew 650 people and invigorated efforts to stop the city's redevelopment plan. They created a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page to draw attention to their mission. They want to keep at least some of the existing buildings intact and reshape them into a mix of public housing and affordable rentals and homes with energy-efficient features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most important, says Miguel Suarez, 59, a social worker who has lived at Lathrop for 20 years, "we want to keep the family atmosphere. We are a family."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little says Lathrop residents and those who left can request a spot in new public housing there once it is redeveloped, but they are not guaranteed one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We want this community to reflect ... what the broader city is: a city of families that are at many income levels," Little says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Shaffer, 37, a former resident and co-chairman of the alumni group, says Lathrop Homes isn't a problem -- it's part of the solution to the city's housing troubles. He would return if the residents' proposals are accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If they made an announcement today that people could come back, in a couple days, these apartments would be full," Shaffer says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Springfield, Mass., the third-largest city in the state, is known as the place where basketball was invented. And it's home to the Basketball Hall of Fame. Yet, it does not stand out as a destination point or secluded and pricey resort area like Martha's Vineyard or a highly regarded college town like Amherst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are not a destination community," says Kathleen Witalisz, president-elect of the Realtor Association of Pioneer Valley, which includes Springfield. "We follow different trends than the rest of the state."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has provided some advantages for home buyers, because the city is considered one of the most affordable areas in New England.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Its housing market is generally evenhanded and predicable. But when consumer confidence dipped last year, its housing market saw one of its toughest corrections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first-time home buyer tax credit helped put sales back into an upswing this year. In May, the city also introduced Buy Springfield Now, a program of lenders, real estate agents, retailers and non-profit groups that offers incentives to home buyers, such as discounted closing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, about 80 families have taken advantage, says Don Thompson, a past president of the Realtor Association of Pioneer Valley. In October, home sales were 20.5% higher than the same month last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. The first-time home buyer tax credit has stimulated the housing market and sparked some home sellers to move up to the next level, which pushed prices up, Witalisz says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, the median home price was 5.9% higher than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. The unemployment rate in Springfield was 12.2% in November, much higher than a year ago, when it was about 8.5%, says Karl Petrick, assistant professor of economics at Western New England College.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is home to Smith &amp; Wesson, the handgun manufacturer. But biotechnology firms are moving to Springfield to be near its three large hospitals, Petrick says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. A housing development, Courtside, collapsed during the housing bust. But it's been repurchased and restarted. The subdivision in East Springfield will provide about 61 new homes for middle-class families and professionals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are trying to attract a better economic group of people into the city," Thompson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helen Edgar is selling a ranch-style home with three decks and a two-story atrium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price: $1.2 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction ran 12/1/2009: A photo of the Grand Canyon was misidentified Friday as red rock formations around Sedona, Ariz. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you visit Sedona -- and some 3 million people do each year -- make sure to send postcards home. After all, this city is named for Sedona Schnebly, the wife of its first postmaster, who arrived in the central Arizona town in 1902 -- and there's plenty of natural beauty to write about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sedona is famous for its stunning formations of red rocks, and it sits on the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau, a geological formation that runs through five states. Here the limestone and sandstone are at their most vivid, and the city, just 19 square miles, is surrounded by protected lands, including the Coconino National Forest and two wilderness areas. Sedona sits at the entrance to Oak Creek Canyon, and dozens of smaller canyons surround it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many of the homes back up to the National Forest and all that it entails, hiking, mountain biking. Being outdoors is a big deal here," says David Levin of Russ Lyon <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> real estate. That's assisted by the 330 annual days of sun, and a climate milder than much hotter Phoenix and Tucson, as Sedona sits at 4,500 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between its natural beauty, outdoor opportunities and favorable climate, Sedona is hugely popular with visitors, attracting nearly 300 tourists for every one of its 10,500 residents, as well as retirees and second-home owners. "It's always been a second-home market," says Levine. "It's a sophisticated small town with a high quality of life. We don't have any Walmarts or big shopping centers, but there is a large arts community, musicians, sculptors, painters and a lot of galleries."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the housing market consists of single family homes, averaging $550,000 to $600,000, Levine says, although there are some town homes and condos around $200,000. The housing downturn has reduced $2 million homes to $1 million and $1.5 million, and houses that once cost over $1 million are now $800,000 to $900,000, he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at three Sedona neighborhoods:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*West Sedona. This area has the bulk of the city's services, movie theaters and shopping, and is among the most expensive areas, says real estate agent David Levine. The gated Casa Contenta community is popular for second homes because of its turnkey maintenance, he says. At the northwest edge lies Boynton Canyon, home to Enchantment, a renowned luxury spa resort that includes a residential community of 40 exclusive homes. A new spa-focused phase, the Villas at Mii Amo, is being developed, with homes costing about $2 million to $3 million each (villasatmiiamo.com).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Uptown. With prices equal to West Sedona, this area is more residential. At the entrance to protected Oak Creek Canyon, Uptown is very close to the surrounding wilderness and red rock landscape. "There are so many trails you could hike every day for a year without repeating," says Levine. There are some two-bedroom condos available from the mid-$200,000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Village of Oak Creek. This village to the south of Sedona is more of a neighborhood than a suburb, except that prices are 10%- 15% less and property taxes are slightly lower. It attracts more full-time residents because of its excellent school system. It is also the least-expensive area and has the city's top golf course community, Sedona Golf Resort, popular with vacation-home buyers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're in the market for a home, the world is your oyster. Interest rates are at record lows. Housing prices in many parts of the country are still depressed. And you may be eligible for a generous tax break, even if the home you buy isn't your first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Nov. 6, President Obama signed legislation that provides a $6,500 tax credit for some current homeowners who buy another home. The law also extends the $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, scheduled to expire Nov. 30, until next spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judging from the mail we've received, a lot of people are interested in taking advantage of this tax break. But the expanded credit also has whipped up a lot of confusion. Here are some answers to questions from readers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: How do I qualify for the $6,500 credit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: This credit is available for home buyers who sign a binding contract on a new or existing home by April 30, 2010, and settle by July 1 (deadlines that also apply to the first-time home buyer credit). You must have lived in your existing home for five consecutive years out of the last eight. The home you purchase must be your primary residence. However, the law doesn't require you to sell your old home, says Bob Meighan, vice president at TurboTax, the tax software provider. You can use it as a second home or a rental and still claim the credit, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: I sold a home I had lived in for more than five years and bought a new one in August. Do I qualify for a tax credit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: No. For existing homeowners, the $6,500 credit is limited to homes purchased after Nov. 6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Does the home I buy have to be more expensive than the one I own now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: No. While the real estate industry is hopeful that homeowners will use this credit to buy a nicer place, there's no prohibition against using it to downsize, Meighan says. That makes this credit particularly useful for seniors who are interested in moving into a smaller home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are planning to move up, keep in mind that you can't claim the credit if the purchase price of the home exceeds $800,000. Unlike some other tax credits, this one doesn't slowly phase out once you exceed the threshold, Meighan says. If you buy a home for more than $800,000 -- and that refers to the purchase price, not the assessed value or the amount of your mortgage -- you are ineligible for the credit, period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $800,000 cap also applies to first-time home buyers, but only those who purchase a home after Nov. 6. First-time home buyers who bought a home for more than $800,000 between Jan. 1 and Nov. 6 can still claim the credit, assuming they meet the other criteria, Meighan says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: I'm an existing homeowner, and would like to build a new home. Can I claim the credit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Yes, but make sure your builder is good at meeting deadlines. You can claim the credit as long as you have a binding contract in place by April 30 and close by July 1. In the case of a new home, the closing date is the day you move in, Meighan says. If your home isn't habitable by June 30, you won't be able to claim the credit, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: I bought a home in 2008 and claimed the old $7,500 first-time home buyer's credit, which must be repaid over 15 years. Did the new law change that rule?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: No. That credit, which was available for homes purchased between April 9, 2008, and Dec. 31, 2008, must still be repaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $8,000 first-time home buyer credit, available for homes purchased after Dec. 31, 2008, doesn't have to be repaid as long as you remain in the home for at least three years. Existing homeowners who qualify for the $6,500 credit don't have to repay that money, either, as long as they meet the three-year requirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: We have a rental home and would like to sell it to our son, who has never owned a home. Would he qualify for the first-time home buyer credit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: No. The legislation specifically prohibits taxpayers from claiming the credit if the sale is between "related parties," Meighan says. A home sale to a parent, grandparent, child or grandchild would fall into that category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: I sold my home this year and have been renting since. If I buy a new home, do I qualify for the expanded credit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Yes, as long as you meet all of the other requirements, says Mel Schwarz, partner with Grant Thornton in Washington, D.C. The eight-year period used to determine eligibility ends on the day you buy your new home, he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as downtown Allentown, Pa., started to show signs of recovery from the steel and silk factory closings that had decimated the city in the '70s, the recession and housing slump struck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the housing market in the county seat of Lehigh County is climbing after a tough 2008, in part because real estate values never dramatically rose and fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We definitely had an increase in prices, but it was not a crazy surge like a lot of other areas of the country," says Susan Seidel, president of the Lehigh Valley Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. November through January is typically not a brisk market, given weather changes and people's focus on the holidays. But in October, home sales jumped 18.4% higher than the same month last year. "It's been a great time to buy," Seidel says. "Interest rates are down, prices are down and the first-time home buyer could take advantage of the tax credit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. For many years, the housing market benefited from New York and New Jersey workers who found home prices more reasonable in Allentown, says Mark Molchany, past president of the Lehigh Valley Association of Realtors. But demand declined and prices fell after gas prices rose and the recession hit. Now Allentown's prices are growing: In November, the median price was 9.8% higher than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. The unemployment rate in Lehigh Valley increased to 9.5% in September, higher than the state rate of 8.8%. Allentown's top industries are health care and education. For the second month in a row, employment in health care has declined, after reaching the highest level on record in May, June and July, says Peter Phelan, a Pennsylvania Department of Labor &amp; Industry analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Many neighborhoods still have a combination of Victorian and Federal row homes. Buyers looking for an up-and- coming neighborhood are starting to focus on an area known as NOTI (north of Tilghman Street and close to downtown Allentown). It has old industrial buildings that artists are starting to repurpose for studios, galleries and apartments. It also has many brick row homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"First-time home buyers can get a great bang for their buck," says Peter Lewnes, program director for the 7th Street Development Committee. "For less than $100,000, they can get in on the ground floor and fix it up the way they want it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Myron Haydt is selling a French-style home featuring a waterfall.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SANDY SPRINGS, Ga. -- Some of the most elegant addresses in all of Atlanta are found in this wealthy enclave. Sprawling mansions that occupy 2- to 10-acre lots are home to some of the city's most prominent residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were shocked last month when a massive Halloween party exploded in their midst. More than 1,000 people jammed the streets around the brick-and-rock mansion, paying $20 apiece for admission and riding shuttle buses from the parking lot of a nearby <span class="companylink">Publix</span> grocery, police say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was one of those things, be careful what you wish for," says Sandy Springs police Lt. Steve Rose. The event promoter "got a lot more than he expected. It became a gridlock issue with traffic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police say the party had been heavily promoted at Georgia State University in Atlanta and at the University of West Georgia in Carrollton. Food and alcohol were being sold inside the six-bedroom mansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was unbelievable," says neighbor Kathy Battaglia, a user- support analyst for an accounting software firm. "The noise over there was so loud it may as well have been in our house. It sounded like the whole party was in the front yard and on the front porch."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Halloween party was the latest of several in Sandy Springs in which empty mansions are rented for huge parties that draw complaints from neighbors, City Councilwoman Karen Meinzen McEnerny says. "I think it's related to the economy," she says. "We have a lot more vacant property. In August 2008, there were 11 vacant properties in my district. In August 2009, there were 34 vacant properties."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sandy Springs party planner was charged only with disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, because he had permission from the property manager to host a party, Meinzen McEnerny says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Breaking the law</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least the Sandy Springs party was legal. One result of the nation's real estate bust is that police around the nation this year are dealing with people taking over foreclosed houses and throwing illegal parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among them:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In San Diego County, young people have taken over foreclosed houses for late-night rave parties, says Detective Jeff Lauhon of the San Diego County Sheriff's Office. Lauhon says the culprits were well-organized in some instances: A young couple would get a real estate agent to give them a tour of a foreclosed house -- usually in a rural area on a large property. The woman would distract the agent while the man surreptitiously left a window open or door ajar. They would then return and host parties that lasted until the wee hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One main consideration they had was plenty of parking," Lauhon says. "The people hosting called themselves a party crew. It turned into a business venture. They were charging admission, to cover the cost of alcohol and to make a good profit. It's just another example of being an entrepreneur. They just chose to do it in a way that's not lawful."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a half-dozen people were arrested on charges including grand theft, burglary and vandalism, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Tempe, Ariz., after several instances of party crews holding illegal bashes in foreclosed houses, patrol officers started carrying a list of foreclosed homes in their patrol areas. "We encourage officers to proactively get out to those areas and conduct security checks on each patrol," says Sgt. Steve Carbajal of the Tempe Police Department. "In this unique time as far as the economy, as far as the housing market, it really calls for unique strategies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Fort Myers, Fla., another community awash in foreclosures, police busted an illegal party at a foreclosed house earlier this year and arrested several youths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The host was the former resident, in their late teens or a juvenile," Fort Myers police Sgt. Larry King says. "They ended up busting the place up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big, empty homes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Battaglia, who has lived in the Sandy Springs neighborhood for 23 years, says the house that hosted the Halloween party has been on the market for about two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just one of those big houses that isn't selling, I'm sure because of the economy," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the police busted the party, they had to call taxis to transport guests back to their cars because the shuttle buses had gone, Rose says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Battaglia says the soiree might have gone relatively unnoticed had it ended earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everything wasn't completely over, and I couldn't get to sleep until 3:30 a.m.," she says. "It was just exhausting."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New home construction unexpectedly fell 10.6% in October from the previous month to the lowest level since April, raising concerns about a key pillar of the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes were started at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 529,000 units, the Census Bureau said Wednesday. That's 31% below the pace a year ago. Analysts had forecast an annual rate of 600,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts of single-family homes fell 6.8% from September, to a 476,000 annual pace. Multifamily building plunged 34% to a rate of 53,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I take it as a warning sign," says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report comes amid a general upturn in the residential real estate market, with both housing starts and home sales trending up in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists downplayed its significance, noting builders likely scaled back because of uncertainty about whether Congress would extend an $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers. This month, the credit was extended, and a $6,500 credit was made available to many existing homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect both starts and permits to rebound, probably quite strongly" the next few months, says Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>'s Mark Vitner doesn't think the extension "is going to provide the same kind of boost," because most interested buyers already used the credit. "There doesn't seem to be any improvement in underlying (new home) demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The specter of inflation is also prompting modest worries. Consumer prices rose 0.3% in October from the previous month, in line with expectations, the Labor Department said. But core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.2%, slightly more than estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economist Brian Bethune of IHS Global Insight dismissed the increase, noting much of it resulted from a 1.7% jump in prices of new and used vehicles. That, he says, can be pinned on the cash-for- clunkers program, which depleted stocks of 2009 vehicles, ushering in pricier 2010 models sooner than planned. It also caused nearly 700,000 used cars to be scrapped, shrinking supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing costs were unchanged. Apparel prices fell 0.4%. But airline fares jumped 1.7%, and medical costs rose 0.2% after a 0.4% increase in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bethune says the report gives the Federal Reserve "a checkered flag" to keep interest rates low. Yet Vitner says core inflation was greater than expected with unemployment at 10.2%. Inflation could "bottom out sooner than in the last two recessions."</p>
