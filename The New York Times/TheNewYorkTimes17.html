<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BROKERS are busy showing apartments after the bounce in co-op and condo sales reported at the end of the third quarter. But it turns out that not every sale that showed up recently is good news for the troubled Manhattan market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small condominium conversion on East 81st Street known as the Duplex, with 40 one-bedroom apartments, mostly duplexes with small balconies, had a strong spurt of sales last year. But then came the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, and sales stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last month, the building reported eight sales at reduced prices, which fed speculation that the sales drought had ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it turns out that the building is still mired in trouble. After sales stopped last year, the developers, Yossi Zaga and Ben Suky, stopped paying their mortgage and common charges. They were facing bank foreclosure action in State Supreme Court. Then there was a legal dispute after the developers turned a block of apartments over to hotel operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the condos that changed hands went to buyers who had walked in off the street. Mr. Suky said all of the recent sales, which at $1,000 a square foot were about 15 percent below earlier sales, had gone to ''my investor group,'' as part of a plan to pay off the overdue debt, and refinance with a lower mortgage. The foreclosure action has been dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suky said he was ''awaiting offers from several buyers,'' but court records show that a lawsuit was filed by existing buyers and the condo board, complaining about unfinished construction work in the building.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVERYONE has to sacrifice in these difficult economic times, even those fortunate enough to have the cash available to pick up distressed assets. And so, brokers say, Steven Mnuchin, a former executive vice president at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, is giving up the comfort and lordly status of his five-bedroom duplex co-op at 740 Park Avenue, one of the most prestigious addresses in New York, for the suburban wilds of Pasadena, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mnuchin is a founder of Dune Capital, a hedge fund, and part of group that bought the remains of <span class="companylink">IndyMac Bank</span>, based in Pasadena, after its collapse last year under the weight of a huge portfolio of risky mortgages, many given to buyers who were not required to fully document income or assets. IndyMac was the fourth largest failed bank when it was seized by the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Mnuchin, 46, has stepped in to become the chief executive of the holding company for the bank, which has been renamed OneWest Bank, and he has an office at the Pasadena headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last few days, Amanda Brainerd of Warburg Realty has begun quietly showing Mr. Mnuchin's Park Avenue co-op, which has 6,500 square feet, three maids' room, a library and a grand foyer. The place is on the eighth and ninth floors and, being in the A line, has the most desirable view, facing Park Avenue, brokers say. The asking price is $37.5 million, or $5,769 a square foot. If you need a mortgage, don't even think about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1930 building, designed by Rosario Candela, on the corner of West 71st Street, has been home to some of America's wealthiest families, including the Vanderbilts and the Rockefellers, and the new crop of bankers and hedge fund billionaires. In 2006 John A. Thain, the last head of <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> before its merger with <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, paid $27.5 million for a duplex on the 17th and 18th floors. The apartment had been owned by Enid A. Haupt, the late philanthropist and a daughter of Moses L. Annenberg, the publishing magnate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tamara Winn, a daughter of Ira Rennert, an investor in distressed assets, paid $32 million for a lower-floor A-line apartment, on the third and fourth floors, overlooking the treetops and the streams of taxis headed downtown. But that was in January 2008, near the top of the Manhattan luxury market. The seller was the estate of Janet Coleman, an heiress to a fortune created from the manufacture of safes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Mnuchin sells the apartment on the open market, it will be its first sale outside the family since the 1960s, according to ''740 Park: The Story of the World's Richest Apartment Building'' by Michael Gross (Broadway Books, 2005).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was purchased in the early 1960s by Emanuel Terner, a manufacturer of beer and soda bottles who sold out to what is now <span class="companylink">Kraft Foods</span> and then created another bottle company. He sold the apartment to his daughter Carol Lederman and her husband, Mark, who in turn sold it in 2000 to Mr. Mnuchin, a nephew, for $10.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mnuchin got his start at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> after graduating from Yale, following in the footsteps of his father, Robert Mnuchin, who retired as a managing partner in <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and went on to found an art gallery, L&amp;M Arts. The younger Mr. Mnuchin left <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> when he was 39 with a fortune reportedly worth $46 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear how much such an apartment can fetch; the asking prices of luxury apartments are down sharply. But Richard Steinberg, a broker at Warburg Realty, says the mystique of 740 Park Avenue may transcend the uncertain market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a beautiful line, extremely grand and gracious,'' Mr. Steinberg said, ''and there are people who will pay anything to get into 740 Park.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS many co-op and condo owners can attest, ownership has its drawbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These include the intermittent misery of dealing with a board and the waking nightmare of serving on one. There are also the occasional hair-raising assessments for improvements to the building, on top of the expense of maintaining an apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, in the absence of a rising market to ease the pain of having property, owners might be excused for wondering what it would feel like to surrender the keys and become a renter again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would it be a relief -- or an unnerving loss of control? A comedown, or, in the aftermath of the housing debacle, a fashionable, politically correct choice? Moving from owning to renting seems to teach some people that they just weren't meant to be renters, while others find it liberating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I love it,'' said Kim Lipstein, 38, who unshackled herself from her Upper East Side co-op last spring. ''I feel the weight of the world is off my shoulders.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lipstein and her husband, Evan, 46, waved goodbye to the 850-square-foot two-bedroom one-bath apartment they shared with their children, Samantha, 7, and Jayda, 5, after their plans to combine it with another unit fell apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with Wendy Jodel, a vice president at Citi Habitats, they sought to buy something larger. But they walked away from an accepted offer on a 1,400-square-foot two-bedroom because the maintenance was too high, the reserves too low, and their younger daughter would have been wait-listed for the nearest public kindergarten.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late May, eager to settle into a school zone with enough seats, the Lipsteins signed a year's lease on a three-bedroom three-bath 1,400-square-foot apartment in the Public School 158 zone, near York Avenue and East 87th Street, for $5,200 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not perfect, but it's freshly painted, the floors are redone and the kitchen is fresh,'' said Ms. Lipstein, who described the postwar part-time doorman building as ''nice, not really nice.'' But the amount of space -- and plumbing -- is luxurious: No longer must she tell her girls to line up to go to the bathroom, or to tiptoe across the floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't have to worry that when my children make noise, I'm going to get a letter from the owners downstairs,'' Ms. Lipstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, among the perks of renting is not being saddled forever with a complaining neighbor. ''Here, I tell myself I'll just move,'' Ms. Lipstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike other areas of the country, New York City has always been a renter's town. Owning did not become widespread until the 1980s, when many landlords converted their buildings to co-ops and sold off apartments. Even today, only a quarter of Manhattan residents own their homes, according to Jonathan J. Miller, a Manhattan real estate appraiser, versus 67 percent nationally. Owning is also less likely to be regarded as a barometer of personal fortune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, while shifting from owning to renting during the boom may have been perceived as a setback, some ex-owners say the housing bust has transformed their decision into a canny move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whenever our friends see us, they say, 'We have a place half as big as yours and we're stuck with owning,' '' said Ali Reza Farahnakian, 41, a former ''Saturday Night Live'' writer who owns the People's Improv Theater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't that hard, he said, to make the switch. ''It's not as big a deal as you think it is. You're suffering because you're attached to something you think represents you, but it's just something you have for a moment of time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, after their second daughter was born, Mr. Farahnakian and his wife sold their second-floor walk-up co-op on 50th Street between First and Second Avenues for $531,000, with the help of Mary Murphy Owens of Citi Habitats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, after being turned down by a Sutton Place co-op board, they decided to rent instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was very upset when we didn't get that home,'' Mr. Farahnakian said. ''I have good credit, we had the money, we had an accepted offer. But it was a happy accident.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, they settled into a two-bedroom two-bath apartment in a full-service doorman building on East 48th Street between Second and Third Avenues, near the top of their $3,500-to-$4,000-a-month price range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have so much more than we had when we owned,'' Mr. Farahnakian said; ''people who keep the building immaculate, packages that come without having to worry about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Farahnakians' greatest challenge has been stifling the urge to customize their surroundings: They have made some improvements to their place (ceiling fan, light dimmers) but stopped somewhere short of crown molding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After a month, you don't care as much as you thought,'' Mr. Farahnakian said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other renters hope to reach the point of nonchalance eventually. Eric Seifert, 38, and his wife, Caroline, 42, the parents of two young children, recently sold their two-bedroom one-bath Upper East Side co-op. Betting that prices would sink lower, they banked the proceeds of the sale and rented a house in Tenafly, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first thing we noticed after a couple of days in this house is that it needs a bathroom in the finished basement, where we have a couch, computer, TV and everything,'' Mr. Seifert said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of renovating, he and his wife keep repeating the mantra, ''It's only a rental,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You still have pride in where you live and want it to be nice,'' added Mr. Seifert, who works in finance, ''but there's a threshold of what you'll do and change based on the cost or necessity now that it's a rental. If it costs more than a hundred bucks to do something, we might not do it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, renters who feel as if they have traded up seem happiest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had lived in New York for 12 years, all in old buildings where the windowsills were painted over 900 times,'' said Erik Hastings, 35, the host of ''Travel Show Live'' on <span class="companylink">WABC radio</span>. ''I was ready for cleaner lines and newer construction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expecting their first child, he and his wife sold their one-bedroom Upper East Side co-op this spring for less than they had hoped. Mr. Hastings was reluctant to buy again, as he was not sure how long they would stay in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So instead of getting hitched to another co-op or condo, the couple rented a two-bedroom apartment in a downtown luxury building for $5,000 a month. Their new home has 12-foot ceilings and a walk-in closet. Common facilities include a beachlike rooftop with barbecue pits and a hot tub, and inside, a screening room, a pool table and a gym.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had forgotten how nice it was to actually have amenities at our fingertips,'' Mr. Hastings said. ''Our super is here, the doorman is here, the porters are really here to help make it easy to live here. Even though you lose the sense that this is 'my' place, you also don't deal with the headache that it's 'mine.' We love it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When renters do find themselves in an unhappy situation, they can easily vote with their feet, unlike owners who are more tethered to their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month Suzanne Lane, a former longtime owner, paid $11,000 to break her lease on the $4,600-a-month Upper West Side one-bedroom that she had rented in May. The apartment is in a prewar rental building undergoing construction at the hand of a new owner seeking to upgrade it to a market-rate luxury building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was a fool and I don't mind saying so, if it helps someone else avoid this mistake,'' said Ms. Lane, 62, a pharmaceutical public relations consultant, explaining that she would have steered clear of the building had she paid more attention to a construction rider attached to her lease instead of relying on the broker's overly rosy summary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like living in Bellevue, because you literally don't know what to expect,'' Ms. Lane said, citing water shut-offs, out-of-commission elevators, a deconstructed lobby and a union protest, among other inconveniences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lane walked away, and was rewarded with a cheaper rent in a less chaotic building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some former owners who are happy with the rental experience say something is missing. Adam Tucker, 32, and his wife, Lisa, 30, traded a cramped fourth-floor walk-up co-op in Greenwich Village for a full-service high-rise rental on the Upper West Side near Columbus Circle this past July, with the help of Ric Swezey of Corcoran. Their new one-bedroom has twice the space of their old one, as well as a washer-dryer, an elevator, a doorman and a maintenance team on call for repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the couple, expecting their first child in January, are thrilled, Mr. Tucker said renters have different relationships than owners do. ''You don't have that same camaraderie,'' he said. ''When you're in a co-op, you're all in it together -- you've all made the investment. In a rental, while many people have been there for a long period of time, many are just stopping through. It's a different experience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That trade-off often jolts owners who segue back into renting, said Julie Friedman, an executive vice president at Bellmarc Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Renting is not necessarily a bump down in terms of quality of life,'' Ms. Friedman said; ''it's mostly an emotional quality.'' People who move from intimate co-ops into large rental buildings sometimes feel anonymous, she said. ''It may be liberating at first, because you come with no baggage, no one knows you, and you have no responsibilities, but that gets old fast when no one greets you by name.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or jumps when you call: Some recovering owners find that they are getting less service, not more, and chafe at losing the clout that goes along with an ownership stake in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I took a lot of pride in my apartment in Chelsea and I was on the board,'' said Christina Abad, 35, a sales agent in Corcoran's Williamsburg office. ''And that made a huge difference -- I had a voice and a presence there. Here, I feel like I'm just a renter now, one of many. There's no opportunity to be on the board, and there are a lot of kinks to be worked out because it's a brand-new building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the amenities far outclass those of her 1970s-era co-op, and she enjoys the two-bedroom two-bath apartment with the 1,000-square-foot terrace that she shares with her boyfriend, Michael Hearn, 32, another Corcoran agent. Still, the feeling of disempowerment is unsettling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've only been here a month,'' Ms. Abad said, ''and I've already decided I don't want to be a renter in a year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Goldfarb, 33, who sold his gut-renovated studio loft in March 2008 and rented another studio in the same building, very much misses his Viking stove, along with his walnut floors and Ann Sacks tile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anything in the rental market won't have the renovations you really want,'' said Mr. Goldfarb, a senior sales associate at Citi Habitats who sold in order to cash in on the then-robust market. The move was meant to be temporary until he found another property to renovate, but stricter mortgage requirements have impaired his buying power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the positive side, he doesn't miss the looming possibility of assessments, like the $10,000 one he paid as an owner. He also finds himself feeling less bothered when elevators break and laundry rooms flood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he can't shake the feeling of being a captive in an aesthetically displeasing holding cell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not so happy,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TODD AND LAUREN FORMAN last year found themselves facing a decision that confronts many young and growing families living in Manhattan: stay or go?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The second kid was the killer,'' said Mr. Forman, a private financial adviser, explaining why the suburbs looked so appealing. ''With the first one starting school, it was inevitable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many dyed-in-the-wool urbanites trying to stay as connected to the city as possible, the Formans found their solution in Tenafly, N.J..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few minutes north of the George Washington Bridge, this hilly Bergen County borough on the Palisades has been popular with affluent professionals seeking a more suburban setting with large houses and expansive properties, while remaining close to the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another bonus is the school system, consistently rated among New Jersey's most successful. It has helped make the borough a magnet for education-oriented families from increasingly varied ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At back-to-school night at Tenafly High School last month, Dr. Alexa Gottdiener said she was amazed by the facilities and backgrounds of the faculty members who would be teaching her freshman son, Ben, this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone is incredibly accessible, and the teachers seem really happy and motivated,'' said Dr. Gottdiener, chief of medicine at Englewood Hospital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the Formans, who are just getting to know this borough of 14,300 people since their move in August, the Gottdieners moved from Chicago in 1997. The Formans' home, for which they paid $1.5 million, is an almost new 4,000-square-foot five-bedroom colonial. The Gottdieners are now in their second Tenafly home, having lived until last summer in a 1940s house on the east side, then moved after finding what Dr. Gottdiener called ''one of the town's 100-year-old gems'': a recently restored five-bedroom stone house close to the town center. They paid $2.05 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gottdieners' house is something of an anomaly. The borough does have its historic houses, as well as two historic districts requiring official approval of any exterior change to homes. But the tendency in recent years has been to knock down the more modest homes built in the middle of the last century, and replace them with double-height mansions. Mayor Peter Rustin sees overdevelopment as one of Tenafly's most pressing issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone wants to be the last one to build a new home, with no one else coming after them,'' said the mayor, acknowledging the occasional controversy over teardown proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenafly has strict construction codes for home setbacks and tree replacement, but builders like Russell Porrino are still drawn to speculative work there, despite an overall slowdown in such construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The demographics are very strong,'' said Mr. Porrino, who is also a broker with Friedberg Properties. ''You have a very affluent, very international community. There are people who want Tenafly and won't go anywhere else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a tremendous mix in Tenafly,'' said Bobby Thompson, a 71-year-old roofing contractor who is a lifelong resident. ''It makes Tenafly exciting to have such a mix like this where everyone gets along so well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 4.6-square-mile borough is bounded by Cresskill to the north, Englewood to the south and Bergenfield to the west. Census data have identified five languages besides English as the first spoken at home; the leaders are Korean (18 percent) and Hebrew (5.6 percent).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large Jewish population has a range of synagogues to choose from, in addition to the Kaplen Jewish Community Center on the Palisades. While not particularly devout, Mr. Forman said he ''knew there was a good, vibrant Jewish community here.'' His son goes to preschool at the community center, while his wife has found the women at the center ''extremely nice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses on East Hill, where most lots are close to an acre in size, were once the most sought after, said Jeri Green, a broker with Prominent Properties <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>. But ''in today's world,'' he said, ''people are lucky to live in any part of Tenafly. And there's something to be said for living closer together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, the borough has been home to professional athletes, including Yogi Berra, and actors, including Ed Harris and Paul and Mira Sorvino. The homes of two of its most notable historic figures -- the suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the bandleader Glenn Miller -- are registered landmarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An effort to build a large supermarket on a former industrial site downtown was defeated a few years back. In its place is a 128-unit gated condominium complex, the Plaza at Tenafly, with prices ranging from $300,000 to $800,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other condo projects include the Crossings at Tenafly, Victoria Square and the Heights, whose 35 town houses range in size from 3,700 to 5,100 square feet and cost from $1.2 million to $1.55 million. Condos are cheaper in the historic Cotswold building (where Glenn Miller once lived) and the Browning House, once the high school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median household income is $109,887 (the state average is $67,142), so first-time buyers may not find much in their range. Mr. Thompson's one regret, for instance, is that his four grown daughters cannot afford to buy homes here. Even though housing prices have softened, desirable homes are still selling in the $1 million range and up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 110 single-family homes and 55 town houses or condos on the market. The average sale price of a single-family house in the first nine months of 2009 was $873,973, versus $915,581 for the same time frame in 2008, according to the New Jersey Multiple Listing Service. The average sale price for a condominium dropped to $519,167 from $667,815 during that period. The least expensive single-family listing is an early 1900s two-bedroom one-bath house on a tiny lot, on the market for $215,000. The highest price, $3.998 million, is on a six-bedroom six-and-a-half-bath 2005 Georgian colonial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Damashek, another recent Manhattan transplant, said he had watched the listings since last fall, waiting for prices to drop. In April he and his wife, Jennifer, moved quickly on a 7,500-square-foot house built in East Hill three years ago (on a teardown site), paying $2.065 million, which Mr. Damashek called a ''good price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes are high. On a 1980s six-bedroom house on a half acre being sold for $1.149 million, they are $21,590 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving is the preferred commuting method, given that Tenafly is five to eight minutes from the George Washington Bridge, via Route 9W or the Palisades Parkway. Traffic can be brutal on the bridge, but Mr. Damashek says that if he leaves home by 6:15 a.m., he can be in his law office in Midtown in 30 minutes. There is no rail service from Tenafly, although there has been discussion of an area light-rail line. Some commuters take buses -- either <span class="companylink">New Jersey Transit</span> or Coach -- or drive to Edgewater Landing for a ferry ride into the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenafly's bustling downtown has various one-of-a-kind shops and restaurants as well as an art-movie house and a hotel. Cafe Angelique, in the historic train station building, is a major gathering place on weekends. Some residents are drawn to nearby Englewood for its vibrant downtown scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The borough's comprehensive recreation program, with its numerous sports teams and park facilities, serves a large percentage of the population. The soccer program alone has 869 children, according to Jerry O'Brien, the recreation chairman and a broker at Coldwell Banker. Tenafly also has a golf club and two outdoor swim clubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opposite the station building, Huyler Park serves as an events hub. Among other outdoor offerings are the Davis Johnson Park and Garden and the Tenafly Nature Center, a 380-acre park at the top of East Hill that has hiking and cross-country ski trails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The schools consistently rank among the top five in the state. The four elementary schools are Mackay, Maugham, Smith and Stillman. The middle school has an enrollment of 850.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenafly High School, with 1,136 students, was named a Blue Ribbon School by the federal government in 2005. It offers 21 Advanced Placement classes. SAT averages last year were 623 in math, 583 in reading and 595 in writing, versus 514, 492 and 494 statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenafly's name, bestowed by settlers in 1688, derives from the Dutch for ''10 swamps.'' By the 19th century much of its forested land had been cultivated. It became part of Palisades Township in 1872 and an independent borough in 1894. The New York architect Daniel Topping Atwood changed the look of the town in the 1860s. He designed many significant homes and buildings, including the railroad station.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year after Washington rescued the banks considered too big to fail, the ones deemed too small to save are approaching a grim milestone: the 100th bank failure of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what has become a ritual, the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> has swooped down on a handful of troubled lenders almost every Friday, seizing 98 since January alone and putting their assets into the hands of another bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the parade of failures still represents a mere fraction of America's small banks, it underscores a growing divide between them and large institutions like <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> and <span class="companylink">U.S. Bancorp</span>, which are slowly growing stronger as the economy improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burdened by worsening commercial real estate loans, many small banks' troubles are just beginning. Many analysts say that the now-toxic loans could sink hundreds of small lenders over the next few years and place a significant drag on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, the bank failures are placing enormous strain on the F.D.I.C. and its fund, which keeps depositors whole. Flush with more than $50 billion only two years ago, the fund recently fell into the red.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of more failures has led the F.D.I.C. to seek new ways to replenish the fund with higher and earlier payments by healthy banks, even after setting aside reserves for future losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initial wave of failures has also unsettled some communities, even though most of the troubled institutions have been bought by other banks rather than shuttered. While deposits are safe thanks to federal insurance, the new buyers often do not have the same ties to local businesses as the former owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, they tighten lending and make it harder for longtime customers to obtain loans or favorable terms. In other cases, managers of the new bank make other changes, like ending offers for high-interest certificates of deposit and calling in certain lines of credit. In the longer term, some new owners are likely to close branches of the bank they have acquired in order to cut costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the near term, bank failures can be painful,'' said Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>. But a bank that is teetering on collapse is not going to lend, she said, and ''that's not good for the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators expect closures to ripple through hundreds of small banks over the next couple of years, especially in the Midwest and Southeast, where lenders have been hard hit by the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These banks loaded their balance sheets with loans to home builders and other property developers to make up for lost business in credit card and mortgage lending that bigger competitors wrested away. They eased their lending standards during the boom years and made big bets on new housing developments, strip malls and office projects. Now, many of those deals are falling apart, and the lenders are scrambling to raise capital to cushion the losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These banks were big enough that they could do loans that were fairly sizable,'' said John R. Chrin, a former investment banker who is now an executive in residence at Lehigh University. ''If they go bad, they are toast.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of bank failures is expected to accelerate in the coming months. There were just 25 bank failures in 2008 and just 10 in the five previous years. But in September alone, regulators took over 11 banks in nine states that were saddled with soured commercial real estate loans, from Corus Bank, a $7 billion construction lender based in Chicago that financed projects across the country, to Brickwell Community Bank in Woodbury, Minn., which had just a single branch and $72.6 million in assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three others were taken over this month, including Warren Bank, a small lender just outside Detroit. Regulators swept into the offices on a recent Friday night after brokering a sale to <span class="companylink">Huntington Bancshares</span> of Ohio, a regional bank with a big presence in Michigan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Saturday morning, Huntington had taken control of the bank's computer systems, started reassuring depositors and placed vinyl signs with its name outside some of the Warren Bank branches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the process went smoothly, customers still found it unnerving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People expect companies to go out of business, not banks,'' said James R. Fouts, the mayor of Warren, Mich., whose working class city of 140,000 has had a front row seat to the collapses of General Motors and Chrysler. ''That is something that you expect to hear about in the Great Depression, and it further exacerbates the feeling that financially, the country is not yet in stable shape.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banking system may also be facing a long recovery. About $870 billion, or roughly half of the industry's $1.8 trillion of commercial real estate loans, now sit on the balance sheets of small and medium-size banks like these, according to an analysis by Foresight Analytics, a research firm. For most of the banks, this represents the biggest and riskiest part of their loan portfolio, since they lack the trading streams and fee businesses of their larger rivals. And as a group, small banks have written off only a tiny percentage of the losses that analysts expect them to incur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, applying only the commercial real estate loss assumptions that federal regulators used during the stress tests for the big banks last spring, Foresight analysts estimated that as many as 581 small banks were at risk of collapse by 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, commercial real estate losses put none of the nation's 19 biggest banks, and only about 5 of the next 100 largest lenders, in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, the biggest and most troubled of the banks, has a relatively small portion of its loans tied to commercial real estate and may begin to recover faster than other rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerard Cassidy, a veteran banking analyst, said the problems call to mind the wave of small bank failures in Texas and New England two decades ago during the savings and loan crisis -- only on a national scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then, regulators closed more than 700 lenders in those regions. Today, Mr. Cassidy projects that as many as 1,000 small banks will close over the next few years and that their losses will be more severe. ''It's a repeat on steroids,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Bair said the savings-and-loan crisis far surpassed the current situation. ''We aren't anywhere close to that today, and based on current projections, I don't think we will get near that pace,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if hundreds of banks collapsed, they would not threaten to bring the financial system to its knees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, the 8,176 smallest banks control just 15 percent of the industry's $13.3 trillion in assets. And thanks to the expansion of the government's deposit insurance program, regulators also appear to have squelched the threat of bank runs that brought down <span class="companylink">IndyMac Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span> last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer deposits are now insured up to $250,000 per account, and the F.D.I.C. offers unlimited coverage on noninterest payroll accounts used by businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've passed the panic stage,'' said Frederick Cannon, the chief equity analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is more, community bank supporters say the bulk of their institutions will emerge from the crisis stronger. ''The community banks are picking up market share,'' said Camden R. Fine, the head of the Independent Community Bankers of America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are angry with all the shenanigans on Wall Street,'' he said. ''They believe their money stays local when they put it in a community bank, rather than sent off to Never-Never land.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two photographs with ''Living Here'' in the Escapes pages on Oct. 9 were published in error. While two of the featured homes are in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, and were accompanied by photographs of them, the descriptions of homes in Hermosa Beach, Calif., and Seattle were also accompanied by photos of a three-bedroom home in San Miguel de Allende, not of the homes described.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MY parents died when I was in my 20s, and my mother asked my uncle to take over her parenting responsibilities. He was very artistic and in the 1950s became very involved in the Instituto Allende. I never got to San Miguel, though. I was a young lawyer, always working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When my uncle died, he left me his paintings. Seeing them opened up a longing in my heart. I took my family to San Miguel, and the connection was instantaneous. Four days later, I bought a house there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This house, which is historic, is three stories but very tiny. The furniture had to be constructed off site and then assembled inside. The true pride and joy of my restoration is the roof garden. When the sun comes up, you hear the church bells toll, dogs bark, and roosters crow. Squealing with delight, kids burst from their houses to play or go to school. And a golden light spills over the buildings. It is in those moments that my uncle is so alive to me. I hear what he heard and see what he saw. In short, I understand.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Democratic Congressional leaders are working with the White House to extend an expiring $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, and aides said Wednesday that they were considering making it available to current homeowners who purchase a new residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extending and possibly expanding the popular home-buyers credit, which is due to expire after November, is high among options for further stimulating the economy and creating jobs, Congressional aides said, though a White House official said it was only briefly mentioned on Wednesday in an Oval Office meeting between President Obama, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Democratic leaders met with the president to discuss a broad range of options to combat persistent high unemployment, officials say. The existing credit for first-time home buyers will expire at the end of next month if not extended, and two other components of the economic safety net -- unemployment compensation and health care benefits for those who have been out of work for long periods -- will expire at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the likelihood of extending those measures, which were part of the $787 billion stimulus law earlier this year, the president and Congress were also weighing additional steps, given projections that jobs will continue to be lost into the middle of next year despite signs of economic recovery, possibly driving the unemployment rate above 10 percent. But they insist that any package will not add up to a second stimulus package, a prospect that would invite Republicans' attacks on the effectiveness of the first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeping the home-buyers credit and broadening it has been a priority for real estate agents and the home builders lobbies, and for Mr. Reid, who faces a tough re-election race next year in a state that has been among the hardest hit by the housing crisis since mid-2007. In a statement after the White House meeting, Mr. Reid said the government should ''continue efforts to strengthen the housing market by extending the home-buyer tax credit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time it is scheduled to expire, for home purchases that close before Dec. 1, the home-buyers credit will be responsible for nearly 400,000 sales of new and existing homes, out of total sales of 1.4 million, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. That is roughly in line with estimates from the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi, who formerly advised Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and is now consulted by Democrats in the administration and in Congress, has advocated extending the credit through next August and making it available to all home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allowing the credit to expire this year would result in a decline in sales of homes that are not facing foreclosure just as sales of foreclosed homes are expected to pick up, Mr. Zandi said in an interview, ''putting further downward pressure on house prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The economic recovery will not evolve into a self-sustaining economic expansion and risks unraveling back into recession until house prices stop falling,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the tax break is not cheap. Congressional analysts put the cost in lost tax revenues at about $1 billion a month. Mr. Zandi said that expanding the availability of the credit to more home buyers through August would cost perhaps $30 billion. While some in the housing industry have proposed nearly doubling the credit to $15,000, Mr. Zandi said $8,000 ''seems to have been a sufficiently powerful incentive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Democrats in Congress and the White House emphasize that no decisions have been made about the home buyers credit or any other measures, two officials said that the cost of extending the credit could be covered by redirecting money in the two-year $787 billion stimulus package that was scheduled to be spent after this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current credit is limited to buyers who earn up to $75,000 a year, or couples who make $150,000; in gradually smaller amounts the credit is available to individuals with income from $75,000 to $95,000 and to couples making from $150,000 to $170,000. While the housing industry supports lifting the income caps so that even wealthy home buyers are eligible, White House and Congressional aides say that is not under discussion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the House is expected to pass legislation from Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to extend the credit through 2010 for people who have been out of the country this year in the military or intelligence or foreign services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reid is a co-sponsor of a bipartisan Senate bill that would extend the existing credit for six months, through May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-buyers credit has come in for criticism similar to that lodged against another popular stimulus program, the ''Cash for Clunkers'' subsidy that went to people who traded in vehicles for more fuel-efficient models -- that the credit persuades people to act faster on purchases, depressing activity later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry officials counter that expediting home sales helps to stabilize home values now, which is essential for sustaining economic growth. And unlike car sales, home sales have a multiplier effect that spurs job-creating growth throughout the economy. Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said each house sale on average yielded $63,000 spent on goods and services, like moving vans and furniture.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GLENMONT, N.Y. -- THE location of her house, in a suburb outside Albany, is one of the first hints that Susie Essman, comedian, wife and stepmother, is nothing like Susie Greene, the perpetually enraged, expletive-spewing Los Angeles housewife she plays on ''Curb Your Enthusiasm.'' If you need more proof, there are the two little words you hear after you call and ask if you can come over early: ''I'm vacuuming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A vacuum, you can bet, is nothing Susie Greene, with her successful show biz-manager husband and screaming animal-print wardrobe, has ever touched with her perfectly manicured hand. It's kind of surprising that Susie Essman, the quintessential fast-talking New York City comic -- who is having the biggest success of her life, with a new book, ''What Would Susie Say?,'' out this week, a featured role in a hit HBO series and fans begging her to insult them the way she does her co-star, Larry David -- would be vacuuming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then Ms. Essman's life, as she talks about it in stories that career happily into other stories like bumper cars at a fun park, is full of the unexpected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, after a lifetime of being single, Ms. Essman, now 54, fell in love with an upstate contractor-turned-Realtor named Jimmy Harder, became stepmother to four children and bought a ranch house in the suburbs -- yeah, she was the one who bought it. She could afford it, and Mr. Harder was changing careers and going through a divorce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house is more suburban than she would like, she said, but the children are only a mile away from their mother.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six years ago, she said, she was illegally subletting a rent-stabilized apartment on West 78th Street -- paying $1,200 for a large one-bedroom with an eat-in kitchen -- and then the super died and the new super ratted her out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is that coffee hot enough? You sure you're comfortable there at the kitchen counter?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then: ''Michael Harder, my brother in law, he does wedding flowers -- he had two weddings up in Lake George this weekend -- he always has extras, he came by yesterday and he had no extras. I said, 'I got company coming tomorrow. What do you mean you got no extras?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is how I have conversations,'' she said. ''Joy and I will have 17 conversations at once.'' (That's Joy Behar, ''The View'' host who is her best friend.) ''It drives Jimmy crazy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harder, when he arrived with his 16-year-old daughter, Cyndi, who had just passed the test for her learner's permit -- much proud mom noise at this point from Ms. Essman -- showed no sign of going crazy. He's good looking and buff in a sharp gray suit, and sits in during the first hour and a half of the interview, perhaps being sociable, perhaps protective, maybe with managerial thoughts in his head. He and Ms. Essman have been married a year and, for sure, he's proud of his wife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just thought she was incredible, fast, witty, smart,'' he said, recalling the first time he saw her perform, at Caroline's. ''Susie walks on stage and bam! You don't know what hit you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You see why I married him,'' Ms. Essman purred. ''He was still a contractor when he used to come to see me. He had jeans and a tool belt. It was hot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I still have a tool belt,'' Mr. Harder said. ''I can put it on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to the house. There is a classic episode of ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' in which Susie Greene, who has moved into a new house, asks Larry David if he'd like a tour. When he says no, she tosses him out of her house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-life Susie is just as proud to show off her home, a 1980s ranch she bought for $353,000 three years ago, as well as several things that would never impress Susie Greene. Ms. Essman has loads of stuff, like a $900 red leather mission rocker and $800 leather couches in the den that she found at flea markets or on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>. And her husband finished the basement himself -- something she mentioned at least four times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's so important about a guy who can finish a basement, she is asked after the husband has gone to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Competence,'' Ms. Essman said. ''It's so primal. It's, 'We're in the forest and if there is a nuclear holocaust he could build a lean-to.' He could survive. He's a guy -- Jimmy's a guy, not a metrosexual -- he's a guy and totally competent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does he compare to men she used to date?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Actors, musicians -- you know those types, artistic types,'' she said. ''I never went out with anybody who had children, so here was this man who was the most incredible father. I saw that right away, the maternal, the taking care of. I think that finishing the basement goes to safety. From the very beginning, I felt totally safe, that I was going to be taken care of.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Susie Essman life story: Grew up in Mount Vernon, N.Y., one of three children. Her mother was a professor of Russian, her father an oncologist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the time she was a child, Ms. Essman knew she wanted to be a comic actress, but lacked confidence. She got a degree in urban studies at the State University at Purchase and spent most of her 20s waitressing, finally getting up her nerve to perform at an open-mike night at a comedy club in the Village called Mostly Magic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, Larry David, whom she knew from the club scene, called and asked if she would play Susie Greene, the wife of the comic Jeff Garlin, who was playing Mr. David's manager and best friend on a new show he was doing for HBO. The show was unscripted and so was the character. Ms. Essman took her cue of who Susie Greene was from the ultra-modern home the character had on season one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I took one look and said this is a Beverly Hills housewife whose husband is in the business,'' she said. ''She gets her hair blown out three times a week, gets every kind of facial. She wears lots of animal prints. Each individual piece is frequently O.K. -- it's the combination that puts it over the top.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show took off, Susie Essman's career took off, and in 2003 she met Jimmy Harder, whose children ranged in age from 10 to 15. She had never had a desire for children but, as is obvious in ''What Would Susie Say,'' she took to motherhood not just naturally, but exuberantly. And, of course, the children were excellent material.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My mother tried to give me advice,'' she wrote. ''She says, 'You know you can't buy their love.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not true. ''You can, and it's exponential,'' Ms. Essman said. ''They're like Russian mail-order brides: the more you spend, the more they love you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Essman still has a large apartment in Manhattan, but home is now upstate. She does not have a housekeeper because she thinks having someone else do the housework is not a good message to send to children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Susie Greene, Ms. Essman thinks she is misunderstood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People think she's a yelling, angry, crazy woman, when the truth is it's justified, she's provoked,'' Ms. Essman said. ''I love Susie Greene -- she is so freeing. I analyze things from every which way. She just reacts without any kind of censor. Everything is an indignity, and she is absolutely sure of herself in every single response.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She continued: ''All those doubts held me back for years: I wasn't good enough, I wasn't pretty enough, is this the right dress to wear? Susie Greene thinks she is drop-dead gorgeous and everything she chooses to put on is drop-dead gorgeous. Imagine being like that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the character without self-doubt, who says exactly what she thinks and is not afraid to get mad, wasn't written for Susie Essman -- it came out of her. And it made her career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She has made my life,'' Ms. Essman said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ARLINGTON, Va. -- While many metropolitan markets around the country are enduring steep increases in vacancies in their office and retail sectors, the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington is an oasis of stability -- and even of prosperity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Served by five Metro subway stops within four miles, the corridor continues to attract new tenants, buyers and developers in the face of the deepest recession since the Great Depression. ''It's really an anomaly, considering the tough economy we've been in since December 2007,'' said Sigrid G. Zialcita, managing research director for Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a global real estate services firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm's most recent figures for the corridor show vacancy rates of 8.6 percent for offices -- compared with a national suburban rate of 18.3 percent -- and 3.5 percent for retail space, the second lowest of 23 major markets surveyed, ranging from 3.3 percent in Washington to 27.5 percent in Orlando.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office rents in the corridor are actually up slightly, but remain below those in Washington, across the Potomac River. ''For comparable Class A space, we're looking in the D.C. central business district at about $50 to the mid-$60s for trophy space,'' Ms. Zialcita said. But in the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor, rents for Class A offices are $39 to $45 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 3.3-mile corridor extends from the high-rise riverside canyons of Rosslyn; through Courthouse, the seat of Arlington County's government; to hip Clarendon; to Virginia Square with its branch campus of George Mason University; and finally to Ballston, a few square blocks of high-rise offices, hotels and residences and also a hub for science and technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Rosslyn-Ballston corridor will continue to be the most sought-after area in Northern Virginia in the foreseeable future,'' Cushman &amp; Wakefield said at the end of June. ''It has remained resilient during the worst recession in decades, and should continue to do so, as demand will remain healthy and new supply will be low for the next few years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The positive economic vibe was evident this summer with the announcement that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency would move its 800 employees from older leased space nearby into a new 355,530-square-foot building designed to meet Defense Department antiterrorism standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Darpa building, slated to be completed in 2012, is part of a 1.2-million-square-foot mixed-use project called Founders Square. The developer is the Shooshan Company, which was already the dominant builder in Ballston. It previously built the Liberty Center, a one-million-square-foot mix of commercial, residential and retail space completed in March 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We just consistently have new development in what we call urban villages,'' said Terry Holzheimer, Arlington County's director of economic development, recalling that ''we were a decaying urban corridor in the 1970s.'' Since then, he said, ''Arlington has been nothing but consistent in terms of adding buildings over time: 20 million square feet of office space and 20,000-plus housing units over a 25-year period.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government agencies and related contractors account for 60 percent of the leased office space in the corridor, Mr. Holzheimer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arlington County's 26 square miles were a part of the original District of Columbia, but were returned to Virginia in 1846. The transit-related development in the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor has won national recognition for smart growth that mixes offices, shops and living quarters close to subway stops. ''We really worked on creating a sense of place, and on what kind of development we wanted near our Metro hubs,'' said Barbara A. Favola, chairwoman of the county's governing board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rosslyn was little more than a collection of pawn shops and auto repair shops until the 1960s, when new office buildings rose to accommodate government agencies forced to relocate after the razing of temporary buildings erected on the Mall during World War I. Those early Rosslyn high-rises are now gradually being replaced by office towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Rosslyn-Ballston corridor, with its immediate access to downtown Washington, D.C., is an ideal submarket for transit-oriented, mixed-use development,'' said Brian P. Coulter, chief development officer of the JBG Companies, which has been a major developer in Rosslyn and is also active in Ballston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Wilson Boulevard, a main artery, helps define the corridor, the key element in its success has been the subway. Planners had wanted to place it in the median of Interstate 66, on a more northerly alignment. But Arlington officials fought to have it run underground in the corridor to spur development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among recent projects, the Wooster and Mercer Lofts condos, completed in 2007 with ceilings up to 18 feet high and the intentional look of restored industrial warehouses, are three blocks from both the Rosslyn and Courthouse Metro stations, and they are eight-tenths of a mile by foot across the Francis Scott Key Bridge to Georgetown. The developer, Jim Abdo, said that 95 percent of the 87 units in the two buildings had been sold, at prices ranging from $700,000 to $1.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Abdo said he intended to break ground within 12 months on another upscale condo project on an adjacent three-acre lot that he bought for $20 million and cleared of mid-20th-century garden apartments. It is to be called Gaslight Square and have 117 units ranging from $650,000 to $1.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of tremendous economic fundamentals in place'' in the corridor, Mr. Abdo said, ''and a lot of positive growth in retail, restaurant and culture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few Metro stops away, the developer John Shooshan has turned formerly somnolent Ballston into a high-rise, mixed-use area. ''We're just blessed to be in the right place, even at the wrong time,'' he said. His Liberty Center complex is 100 percent leased, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Science Foundation moved to Ballston in 1993, in the vanguard of many institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These include Marymount University, whose business school is across the street from Virginia Tech's planned expanded research center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nature Conservancy, the Office of Naval Research, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the Army Research Office and Virginia Tech's Advanced Research Institute, which is to move into the new center, are all part of the Ballston scene. The Ballston Common Mall provides retailing and the Kettler Capitals Iceplex, where hockey fans are admitted free to watch the Washington Capitals practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Metro stop closer, Virginia Square, just blocks from Ballston, has George Mason's Law School and School of Public Policy and the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan McCaffery, a Chicago developer, saw the corridor's potential a decade ago when he bought land in Clarendon. Former owners had wanted to build a <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, but citizens resisted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCaffery instead built Market Common, a mixed-use project that opened in 2001 and continues to thrive with two street-facing levels of high-end stores arranged in a horseshoe facing a long landscaped lawn, with apartments and offices above and adjacent. ''It's all self-contained,'' Mr. McCaffery said. ''There's always a buzz.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whitlow's on Wilson, a restaurant on Wilson Boulevard, is part of the buzz. Displaced by urban renewal in downtown Washington, it relocated to Clarendon in 1995. The owner, Greg Cahill, liked the small-town feel that he found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ambience is more urban these days. Now, he said, many places, including Whitlow's, feature live music, and there is more of just about everything. ''There are more people, more buildings, condos, apartments,'' he said. ''It's a nice, safe place to come.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list from census data isn't all that surprising, but there it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester County, No. 1. Nassau, No. 2. Hunterdon and Bergen in New Jersey, Nos. 3 and 4, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so it goes. Of the 10 counties in the country with the highest median property taxes, every one is in New York or New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or, to look at another table in the Census Bureau's American Community Survey for 2008, of the 10 counties with the highest real estate taxes as a percentage of home value, all 10 are in New York. Or, to try one more, of the states with the highest median real estate taxes overall, New Jersey is No. 1, Connecticut is No. 2 and New York is No. 4 (tax-averse New Hampshire, which does not have a general sales tax or a personal income tax, sneaks in at No. 3).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This, as anyone who breathes oxygen knows, is a high-tax region. But as Richard Nathan packed up his office on Friday after 45 years of studying or participating in state, local and federal tax and budget policies, he wondered if we had finally reached a breaking point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm a little surprised there hasn't been more heat and more agitation about tax caps and tax burdens in the way there has been in other parts of the country,'' said Dr. Nathan, who retired as co-director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York at Albany. ''I keep thinking, 'When is this dog going to bark?' And the numbers make you think it's going to be soon. It just feels different right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can hear some pretty distinct yips in the New Jersey governor's race, where the property tax burden could help the Republicans win their first statewide race this decade (or perhaps not, if the Republican candidate, Christopher J. Christie, looks like he doesn't have answers either). But whether there's anything more than resigned gnashing of teeth by suburban swing voters in all three states will say a lot about the future of local politics and particularly the fate of Democrats in what are supposed to be the bluest of blue states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property taxes are high around here in large part, of course, because property values are high. But there are several reasons why property taxes are higher here than in other costly parts of the country. Unlike California and Massachusetts, there are few, if any, longstanding brakes in place that kept property taxes down (and, in California, led to disastrous revenue shortages). Public employees unions are powerful and politically feared. And we've come to expect good services -- top-rated schools, nearby police in little boutique towns -- and have been willing to pay for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, whose ''Fix Albany'' mantra got him nowhere when he ran for governor against Eliot Spitzer in 2006 but looks pretty smart in retrospect, says that property taxes are inseparable from dysfunction in state government. He cites several reasons why property taxes are so high: unreasonable state mandates piled on local governments; income tax dollars inequitably distributed back to local governments; far too many local governments -- more than 10,500 in New York -- that need to be consolidated or eliminated; fraud and waste; and economic stagnation producing no expansion in the property tax base. You could throw in crippling Medicaid costs and unsustainable pension costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the No. 1 issue,'' he said. ''People have reached their breaking point. But we still have a long way to go in connecting the dots between dysfunction in state government and high property taxes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, breaking point or not, who knows where this goes? A Proposition 13-style temper tantrum? Painful cuts -- meaning teachers and police? Throw out the bums -- most likely Democrats, who could be fat targets in an antitax backlash? Lots of grumbling but living with an increasingly unaffordable status quo?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerald Prante, an economist with the Tax Foundation in Washington, said at least people feel they get something tangible from their local taxes and can tolerate them if they believe they're getting what they paid for. ''If I told you I spent $40,000 on a car, it doesn't tell you much unless you know what kind of car,'' he said. ''If it's a Lamborghini, it was probably a good deal. If it was a Saturn, it's not such a good deal.'' Thus, for all the angst, the fact that most local school budgets still routinely pass indicates we might be more likely to grumble than to cut close to home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that many suburbanites who bought the luxury car a few years back now can barely afford the Saturn. The New Jersey race will provide some signals. Whether Republicans regain control of the Nassau County Legislature might provide some more. But the status quo can't last, and if there's a huge backlash, Democrats have the most to fear politically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The longer we wait, the harder the reckoning is going to be,'' Dr. Nathan said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Journalists are very likely to have a different reaction than other viewers to the PBS documentary ''Inventing LA: The Chandlers and Their Times'' on Monday night. This isn't because of what it demonstrates about the current troubles of The Los Angeles Times or the newspaper industry in general, because it has practically nothing to say on those subjects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The divergence will come earlier, during the film's account of The Times's first half-century, beginning in the 1890s. Normal viewers will see an interesting chapter in California history, a sordid tale of real estate and politics that will be slightly familiar to anyone who has watched ''Chinatown.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who have devoted their lives to the business of daily print in more recent times, however, will be shaking their heads. Was it really possible that power of such magnitude -- diverting water supplies, building suburbs, playing a central role in the fastest growth any American city has ever seen -- could be exercised from the offices of a newspaper publisher?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, we're meant to see the story of Harrison Gray Otis and his son-in-law Harry Chandler, the men who created The Los Angeles Times and cemented its power, as a cautionary tale. In their hands the newspaper was nothing more than a tool for union busting, race baiting, promoting their business ventures and getting their cronies elected to public office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which makes them fascinating subjects, and makes the first section of ''Inventing LA'' the part worth watching. Once we're past World War II and the narrative focuses on how later Chandlers like Norman and Otis turned the newspaper, whose quality had been an afterthought, into a world-class operation, a lot of the life goes out of the film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The filmmaker, Peter Jones, has the problem endemic to histories of family dynasties: the families tend to get less interesting with each succeeding generation. There's on-screen proof of that here, in the numerous Chandlers Mr. Jones persuaded to sit for interviews about their more charismatic fathers, grandfathers and ex-husbands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dissension among the relatives -- the people Otis Chandler infamously characterized as ''coupon clippers'' living off the family fortune -- would eventually contribute to the decision to sell the Chandler newspaper holdings to the <span class="companylink">Tribune Company</span> in 2000, and that's where ''Inventing LA'' ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its focus on the family means that the years of cost cutting and sagging morale at The Times under Tribune ownership are left out, along with earlier incidents, like the Staples Center scandal involving editorial oversight, that didn't directly involve the Chandlers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story that interests Mr. Jones -- of naked capitalism and myth-making in the desert -- has been told before, in David Halberstam's 1979 book, ''The Powers That Be,'' and in books and essays by writers like Kevin Starr and Mike Davis, who appear in the film. But for most people the defining account remains ''Chinatown,'' Robert Towne and Roman Polanski's fictionalized version of Harry Chandler's water-and-land grab in the San Fernando Valley. If you've ever wondered what the real story was, the first hour of ''Inventing LA'' will fill you in.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON </div><div>1416 words</div><div>4 October 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHALMETTE, La. -- The parish of St. Bernard, a quiet, insular suburb just east of New Orleans, has in the end agreed to allow housing for low-income families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even though it is only a few hundred apartment units, it had to be ordered by a federal judge. The parish has fought desperately to prevent such housing and an influx of renters, at one point even approving a law that prohibited homeowners from renting to anyone other than a blood relative, before it was challenged and repealed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The battle over low-income housing has been one of the most bitter that anyone in the middle-class, mostly white parish can remember, one that has stoked issues the region has been grappling with since Hurricane Katrina: anger at the federal government and long-simmering class and racial tensions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also reflects widespread anxiety about just how drastically the area changed after the floodwaters receded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think people have adopted this issue as one that goes far beyond the reality of its impact,'' said Craig Taffaro Jr., the parish president. ''It tapped into the soul of our recovery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Providing housing for low-income families has been one of the most vexing problems for the New Orleans area in the four years since the hurricane. Tens of thousands of homes, many of them dilapidated, are still vacant. But, in part because the houses that were destroyed were disproportionately for low-income renters, market rents in the city are 35 percent higher than they were before the storm, out of the reach of much of the city's work force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demolition of the four big public housing complexes in New Orleans in 2007 and the approaching end to storm-related federal assistance programs have made these problems more critical, and their solutions more contentious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is particularly true in the case of St. Bernard, perhaps the jurisdiction hit the hardest by Hurricane Katrina. Nearly every one of the 26,000 houses there was severely damaged or destroyed. Ninety-three percent of them were owned by whites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years later, over half of the parish residences are still vacant or unoccupied, according to the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center. The population, at around 37,000, is just more than half of what it was. Many former residents sold their homes to investors. Thousands of people displaced from elsewhere have moved in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The parish has not welcomed these changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September 2006, the Parish Council passed a law that prohibited owners of single-family residences from renting to anyone except blood relatives, except by special approval by the Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parish officials say it was intended to guarantee that neighborhoods would consist largely of owner-occupied homes, with some accommodation for current residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But advocates for low-income housing say it was a blatantly racist policy, given the overwhelmingly white ownership in the parish. St. Bernard officials dropped the ordinance after a lawsuit by the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's loaded in a way no one can miss,'' said John Relman, a civil rights lawyer who represented the center in the suit, adding that he had never come across such a rule before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, last year, a Dallas-based firm called Realty Advisors proposed building four new apartment complexes, at $60 million, in the parish. Thirty percent of the 288 apartments would be rented at market rates. The rest would be set aside for low-income renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reaction among parish residents was swift. Amid grim forecasts of crime, ghettoes and blight, parish officials declared a moratorium on building any apartment complexes with five or more units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Jarrell, an attorney for Sidney D. Torres III, one of the local backers of the apartments, said the anger came largely from an aversion to renters, even though a number of council members are landlords themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And race, Mr. Jarrell said, was certainly a factor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is what it is,'' he said. ''Anybody that says otherwise is being disingenuous.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parish officials denied that they were trying to keep out blacks, saying the parish simply needs more houses, not apartments. They said they would not object if the project involved filling up all the vacant lots already in the parish instead of building new high-density housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a very good idea if we needed it,'' said Earl Dauterive, the chairman of the St. Bernard planning commission. ''We just don't need it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the fury the development has stirred up, no one -- neither the opponents nor the supporters -- knows what the likely racial makeup of the tenants would be, and it is possible that few black families would apply to live in the parish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Race and class make for a complicated mix in this region. Proposed low- or mixed-income developments have met with staunch opposition all over the New Orleans area, in both predominately white suburbs and in primarily black neighborhoods in the city limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A development of 35 single-family, lease-to-own homes in the black middle-class neighborhood of New Orleans East was blocked by the New Orleans City Council in August. The arguments against it -- that it would damage property values and quality of life -- were similar to those heard in St. Bernard. The developer, a New Orleans native living in Atlanta, is considering a discrimination lawsuit, even though almost everyone on both sides of the issue is black.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Perry, executive director of the housing center and a candidate for mayor of New Orleans, said class animosity might be at the root of much of this anger, though discrimination against the poor is not a violation of the Fair Housing Act. It is illegal to discriminate against minorities, however, and given that a disproportionate number of those who need affordable housing in the area are black, he said, these arguments almost inevitably involve race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere has the outcry against low-income housing been as intense as it has been in St. Bernard, particularly since Provident Realty took the parish to court this year. What followed was a season of acrimony, with parish officials doing everything possible to prevent the development from breaking ground. Construction has to begin by this fall if the developer is to qualify for the special disaster-relief tax credits that would make the development profitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At every turn, a federal judge in New Orleans has ruled that the parish's actions were simply camouflaged racism and last month ordered that the parish move forward on the development or face steep daily fines. The parish is appealing her rulings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parish officials, already angered by what they see as a failure of the federal government to help them after Hurricane Katrina, were livid that a federal judge was now a force in their rebuilding. Mr. Taffaro, in a weekly column on the parish Web site, described the lawsuit ''as a means to perpetuate the breakdown of true freedom of American society.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one hearing, a witness for Provident testified that a quarter of St. Bernard residents could not afford market rents. But even many of the parish's poorest residents oppose the apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't need it,'' said Frances Graf, 48, a resident who bought a FEMA trailer from the government for $5 and who gathers daily with other residents at the food bank run by the Community Center of St. Bernard. ''It's going to cause more problems. There ain't no jobs down here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those around her at the food bank agreed and said there was no shortage of ''for rent'' signs in the parish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there was that other objection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You know what it's going to bring,'' said Kathy Gonzales, 55, who lives in a house owned by a relative of her husband and whose rent is subsidized by a Section 8 voucher. ''I'm not going to say it, but you know.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ONCE their children had left the nest, Ruth and Mark Thomas were eager to follow. They had little interest in keeping their Long Island house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything was a problem,'' Mrs. Thomas said. Great effort and expense rarely yielded anything enjoyable or rewarding. ''I don't get to buy a new sofa. I get to have a new water heater. For our 12th anniversary we got a new septic system or something. It's like: Oh, look! I can flush the toilet and not flood the den.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. Thomas had a commute of an hour and 45 minutes each way. ''It made for insanely long days,'' his wife said. ''We could never go out during the week.'' In summer, she would barbecue on the beach with friends, and ''by the time he got there, we were packing up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Thomases, who are in their early 50s, met as students at Syracuse University and lived in Manhattan for a decade before moving to the suburbs. In 1987, they bought a cute Victorian house in Oyster Bay. Then, with two small children, they moved to Locust Valley. ''I traded quaint for a 1955 split level,'' Mrs. Thomas said. ''I went for bathrooms and space.'' Their new place, with four bedrooms and four bathrooms, had almost 2,500 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now their son, Jeff, 21, is a senior at George Washington University, while their daughter, Leah, 23, lives in Brooklyn with her fiance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thomas's journey to his office at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue, where he works in advertising sales for Bloomberg Markets magazine, had five legs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The easiest, quickest way entailed a drive to the <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span> station, a train to Jamaica, a switch to Woodside, a Flushing-line jaunt to Queensboro Plaza and, finally, one stop on the N, R or W train across the East River. ''I would spread out on the train and read the paper,'' he said. ''It wasn't great.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, the couple put their house on the market. One day per weekend, they would clean all morning and leave for the afternoon. ''We saw every lousy movie made,'' said Mrs. Thomas, who has worked as an interior decorator and a caterer. She always baked her specialty, sweet-smelling cinnamon bread, for visitors. When there were no lookers, which was often, their two real estate agents gladly helped themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Trying to sell in this market was horrible,'' Mrs. Thomas said. They didn't look for a Manhattan rental until last spring, when they discerned glimmers of interest in their house. They hoped to rent a two-bedroom two-bathroom apartment for $4,000 to $5,000 a month, eager to give up the responsibilities that came with owning, and to shorten the wearying commute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, the priority was finding a quiet place. ''If it's not quiet, Mark doesn't care how nice it is,'' Mrs. Thomas said. Once, in Manhattan, three German shepherds lived above them. ''It sounded like herds of elephants.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their hunt focused largely on the Upper East Side. On York Avenue, they checked out the Andover near 89th Street and the Barclay near 92nd Street, both owned by Glenwood Management, which has 24 luxury rental buildings around the city. Rents for two-bedrooms were $4,595 to $4,995 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were pretty pleased with what we found,'' Mrs. Thomas said. The apartments ''were basically exactly the same. We have a friend who is in one of them for about 25 years. We've seen how nice they kept it up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She liked Claridge House, on East 87th Street, even more. A two-bedroom there seemed especially big, with plenty of closet space. She was ready to move right in. (Two-bedrooms in the building currently start at $4,650, with a free month on a 13-month lease.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after they saw it, they still had time to kill. On John Gambling's radio show, Mrs. Thomas heard an advertisement for Riverwalk Crossing, a rental building, and Riverwalk Court, the condominium next door, on Roosevelt Island. It was memorable, because ''an ad for an apartment building is not something I normally hear,'' she said. The ad noted the buildings' proximity to Manhattan, ''sweeping panoramic views'' and ''bountiful greenery.'' So she suggested they take a look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Thomases had never been to Roosevelt Island. ''I think years ago we might have taken the tram and not even stepped onto the island -- just for the fun of it,'' Mrs. Thomas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thomas was hesitant. Why bother? But his wife insisted. At the very least, the tram was still fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they saw an apartment at the 18-story Riverwalk Crossing, he instantly changed his mind. ''This one has a wow factor, with more space, wonderful views and 30 percent less money,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By now, the Locust Valley house was on the verge of selling. It finally did, in midsummer, for $650,000 to a couple from Queens with two daughters. (Four years ago, faced with a possible job transfer, the Thomases had accepted an offer for $910,000. The transfer never happened.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their 1,250-square-foot apartment, with nobody above them, has a knockout view of Manhattan. ''I feel we have the best apartment in the place,'' Mr. Thomas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their rent is $4,080 a month, with another $250 a year for the gym and $125 a year for bike storage per bike. Their one parking spot is $180 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two feel almost apologetic about two things. One is moving to Roosevelt Island. People mention it with an edge of disdain -- at least until they visit and see the view, which Mr. Thomas compares to a view from a ship deck. The other is renting. To judge from people's reactions, ''it's almost like we did something dirty,'' Mrs. Thomas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roosevelt Island isn't much for restaurants or shopping. ''In Manhattan proper,'' Mr. Thomas said, ''you can just run downstairs and find something to eat really quick. So it is more of a trip for dining and grabbing a snack, but that is part of the trade-off.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Thomas, who is now a private chef, has no trouble in her smaller kitchen. She bakes cinnamon bread and feeds it to the building's staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, living in the city, she has to ''learn how to do everything all over again,'' she said. ''I am used to jumping in the car and driving to the Dairy Barn in my pajamas.'' (Dairy Barn is a chain of drive-through stores on Long Island.) City living requires ''a whole different mind-set.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her welcome to the city was the theft of her credit card from her bag. (The thief bought MetroCards.) Still, she likes the city better than before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fellow tram riders are warm and polite. It's like ''the first day of a new school, and everybody is new in the school and friendly with each other,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Thomas's commute, he has a tram ride and a one-block walk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He is unbearably happy,'' his wife said. ''If you see somebody skipping to work, it's my husband.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam Chang, the hotel king of New York, surveyed a portion of his domain from West 39th Street, a gritty block south of the Port Authority, from where he can see not one, not two, but a half-dozen of his hotel sites on a single block. ''They ought to name this block for me,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chang, 49, a compact man with a brush cut, then marched through the lobby of his Hampton Inn, one of three hotels he shoehorned into a single 32-story building. On the 20th floor, he opened a door to a secret of his success: Two beds, a desk and bureaus somehow sat comfortably in a room the size of a Park Avenue closet: 250 square feet, about $200 a night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's small compared to a regular hotel,'' Mr. Chang conceded. ''But as long as you customize the furniture, you don't feel it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a city known for the glamour of its landmark hotels -- like the gilded Waldorf-Astoria or the storied Plaza -- and the anonymity of its flophouses, Mr. Chang has built an empire of beds for a heretofore ignored class: the budget traveler. And no one has ever built more hotels in the city than Mr. Chang, who has created 37 and has 22 more in the works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past decade, his limited-service Comfort Inns, Holiday Inn Expresses and Hilton Gardens have helped change the commercial cityscape along with Red Lobster and Applebee's. ''I've got a lot of records in New York,'' he said, then recited them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Narrowest hotel: Hotel Reserve, 51 Nassau Street, 18 feet across.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First ''three pack'' (three hotels in one building): Hampton Inn, Candlewood Suites and <span class="companylink">Holiday Inn Express</span>, on 39th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, which opened this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First Asian-American to build a high-rise hotel in Manhattan: the 24-story Hilton Garden Inn, at 119 West 28th Street, in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People just don't recognize it,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors, real estate brokers and hotel chains love Mr. Chang. Community groups, some elected officials and the hotel and construction unions, not so much. Critics contend he has built his empire barely within city codes and are vowing to stop his freewheeling, nonunion operations in manufacturing districts like the garment center of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sam is a guy where, if you sign a deal with him, it better be signed in blood,'' said Steve McInnis, political director of the New York City District Council of Carpenters. ''He's definitely on our watch list.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, Mr. Chang, a high school dropout turned mogul, predicted he would retire in 2010. But in a concession to hard times, he said he had pushed his retirement date to 2013 and dumped his bodyguard, though not his Rolex or his 2.5-carat diamond ring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, Mr. Chang told Fortune magazine that he had $200 million in cash. Today, he dodges the question of his wealth. After creating 4,344 rooms in the city at a torrid pace since 1998, Mr. Chang has slowed with the economy. Room rates and property values are down sharply, making it difficult to sell the hotels at all, never mind getting buyers to pay twice what he paid to build them, as he did during the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some of the 4,000 rooms Mr. Chang has under development, including projects in the Bronx and on the Bowery, are stalled; the Buildings Department has issued a stop-work order on an 11-story hotel near Union Square for failure to maintain safety equipment and safeguard people and property on the site; and he has a second ''three-pack'' under construction on Staten Island, where the market has nosedived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chang, who has taken two trips to bankruptcy court in the past, said he would not make it a trifecta. ''I'm more conservative now on debt,'' he said. ''We have operating hotels producing a cash flow. I'm just going to slow down and continue to do what I'm good at.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a long time -- let's call it the Pre-Chang Period -- the hotel market in New York operated on some widely embraced tenets. Given the high cost of land, developers focused on building luxury hotels like the Four Seasons or the Mandarin Oriental. Their target guest: the business executive on an expense account. Travelers unwilling to pay hundreds of dollars a night were left to choose from worn tourist hotels like the Carter and the Milford Plaza, or lodgings in New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chang's innovation was to bring the limited-service brands that line the highways of Middle America, like <span class="companylink">Holiday Inn Express</span> or Hilton Garden Inn, to its commercial capital. These hotels did not have restaurants or room service -- usually just a breakfast bar with make-your-own waffles -- but they had clean rooms and international reservations systems, and could command respectable rates from $100 to $220 a night. The surprising little secret: they had a higher profit margin than their upscale brethren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chains were so eager to get into New York City that Mr. Chang was able to persuade them to set aside their cookie-cutter standards, designing custom furniture to fill 200-square-foot rooms in Manhattan instead of their typical 350 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a bit spartan,'' said Carole Lincoln, a visitor from England who spent some time last month in a $147-a-night room at Mr. Chang's <span class="companylink">Holiday Inn Express</span> on 39th Street. ''But it's what I expected for the price. It's clean and it's centrally located.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To hedge the risk of buying more than $150 million in properties, Mr. Chang brought in partners, like <span class="companylink">Hersha Hospitality Trust</span>, Magna Hospitality Group and Gemini Real Estate Advisors, who sometimes financed and frequently bought the hotels before or shortly after completion. He managed to control development costs in part by becoming partners in a construction company. And he searched for inexpensive parcels on narrow midblock sites that were zoned for manufacturing, not residential or commercial towers, but had a loophole allowing hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems like a simple formula,'' said Thomas McConnell, senior managing director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a real estate brokerage that has worked with Mr. Chang on several deals, ''but he was the only one who did it, and did it without much of an organization.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chang, it turns out, is an organization all by himself, a hard-bargaining dealmaker who acts swiftly and carries most of the details in his head, sharing little information about his partners with anyone. With little effort, he can rattle off the number of hotels, the number of rooms in each and how much he paid for a particular parcel of land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Three words describe Sam Chang,'' Mr. Chang likes to say. ''Working. Working. Working.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He defied the accepted wisdom by building 17 hotels on the once-industrial West Side of Manhattan between 24th and 44th Streets, often making a decision on the spot about whether to snatch up an available property. He named his company the McSam Hotel Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He'd buy without due diligence,'' said Alan P. Miller, senior director of Eastern Consolidated, a real estate brokerage firm, who has worked with Mr. Chang. ''He pays all cash. Gambler or not, he's an expert hotel builder.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Mr. Chang, everything is for sale. For years, he has bought and sold a succession of increasingly larger houses on Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2006, home has been a six-bedroom, $3 million estate with a private lake on 18 acres in secluded Centre Island, where Billy Joel is a neighbor. That house is now on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the garage is Mr. Chang's 2006 birthday present to himself: a Maybach, a limited-edition, $500,000 German sedan. He likes to describe how the rear seats can slide into a horizontal position, like the first-class seats on a jet. There is also a Rolls-Royce and a Mercedes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chang throws an annualNew Year's Eve party in Flushing for 200 real estate, construction and financing executives. He is, by his estimation, a ''good drinker'' who prefers Johnny Walker Blue, a rare Scotch that sells for $220 a bottle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expensive jewelry, the fancy liquor and the big houses and cars are a form of revenge, said his friend Michael Kang, an architect who designed some of Mr. Chang's hotels in Queens. When Mr. Chang moved to New York in 1996, he was broke and many people in the Chinese community looked down on him, Mr. Kang said. ''They said he was a nobody.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born in Taiwan, Shan Leong Chang moved to Japan with his family when he was a child. He left school at 17 because, he said, he did not want to waste time. ''I tell everybody I went to homemade college,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He came to the United States in 1977 to help his parents run the 11-room Richards Motel in downtown Los Angeles. By the early 1980s, he had moved to Baltimore, where he operated a succession of Chinese restaurants before buying his first hotel, in Hagerstown, Md., with financing from Taiwanese investors and his cousins. Straining under debt during the recession in 1990, Mr. Chang tumbled into bankruptcy court, where he lost five hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He quickly bounced back, assembling a dozen hotels between Boston and Washington. After a dispute with his cousins, Mr. Chang went to Natchez, Miss., in an ill-fated bid to open a riverboat casino. When he filed for bankruptcy a second time, in 1996, he had $300 in his pocket and $27.7 million in debts, according to court records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He fell in love with every deal that came across his desk,'' said Alan M. Grochal, a Baltimore lawyer who worked for Mr. Chang at the time. ''A lot of dead-dog losers. He had an incredible amount of debt arising out of many, many deals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within months, Mr. Chang was back in business, now in New York, where he struggled to build a Howard Johnson's in Flushing and what became a Comfort Inn at Kennedy Airport. He was rapidly running out of money when he met a wealthy Chinatown garment factory owner, John Lam, who became his financial partner for seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lam ultimately split off and created his own company, and is now a rival. Mr. Chang now owns 31 hotels around the country, including 12 of the 37 he has built in New York. Another two are in Anchorage, Alaska, a stopover on his frequent trips to China. ''I figured if I have to stop in Alaska,'' he said, ''I should own some hotels there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chang's hotels have been popular with budget travelers, but not with New York City community boards or the construction and hotel workers' unions. Since December 2006, his construction company, Tritel, has accumulated 207 serious building violations, 47 of which are still unresolved. Community Board 7 in the Bronx often found him unresponsive when work on a hotel near Fordham University weakened the foundation of an adjoining home, flooding the basement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Their whole approach to the community was very dismissive,'' said Gregory Faulkner, chairman of the community board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some construction unions clashed with Mr. Chang in 2006, while he was building three hotels on the West Side with nonunion contractors. After a pitched battle on the street, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo opened an investigation into claims that one of Mr. Chang's subcontractors was paying immigrant workers substandard wages and using a two-tiered system that offered higher pay for young Irish workers than for Brazilians from Newark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chang later worked out an agreement with the carpenters' union to use union contractors on his larger projects, but that appears to be unraveling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hotel Trades Council, which represents workers at most large hotels in Manhattan, sees Mr. Chang as a direct threat. The union recently persuaded the Bloomberg administration to create a special permit requiring City Council approval to develop hotels in manufacturing districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What this city can't afford is an oversupply of limited-service hotels in manufacturing zones, which will inevitably squeeze out the remaining industrial jobs in the city,'' said Neal Kwatra, political director of the trades council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about the safety, community and union complaints, Mr. Chang played down the criticism, and said it was difficult to avoid citations while building in New York, particularly given the current crackdown on safety. He said his companies worked quickly to fix problems, whether with the Buildings Department or community boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There have been issues with various constituencies,'' acknowledged Mr. Chang's main architect, Gene Kaufman. ''All have been worked out satisfactorily for both sides.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any event, hotel operators are caught between slumping business travel and a glut of more than 10,000 new hotel rooms that have opened in New York City over the past few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Room rates and revenues at both budget and luxury hotels have dropped 30 percent, according to the hotel consulting firm Lodging Advisors, which estimates that that translates into a 60 percent cut in profits. The hotel occupancy rate in Manhattan dropped to 76 percent this year from 84 percent a year ago, according to PKF Consulting, though July occupancy was 84 percent, the same level as in July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's going to be a struggle for Sam to achieve the rates and occupancy that he had projected when he conceived of these projects,'' said Jeff Davis, executive vice president of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> Hotels, a real estate management and investment firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of stress, Mr. Chang has not been paying the interest-only loans for four projects financed by <span class="companylink">Hersha Hospitality Trust</span>. Hersha acknowledged in a conference call with hotel analysts in August that it decided to add the unpaid payments to the principal on the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William T. Obeid, chief executive of Gemini Real Estate Advisors, which has bought three hotels from Mr. Chang, also was upbeat about Mr. Chang's future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He's an incredible survivor, an incredible fighter,'' Mr. Obeid said. ''He is not going to let these projects just fall by the wayside. There's value, maybe not as much as there was 18 months ago, but he'll figure out the situation.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN a year of doom and gloom, the granite postmodern towers overlooking Central Park at 15 Central Park West at West 62nd Street have been a beacon of hope for the battered luxury real estate market in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, as sales stalled across the city, owners of eight of the 201 apartments (there are also 30 staff suites) in the building have sold their units at prices 38 percent above the original closing prices of August 2007, when the building opened, city property records show. That works out to a cumulative gain of $21.9 million, judging by property records filed through the middle of last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, brokers say that with the larger Manhattan market no longer in free fall, interest is quickening in the building's largest and most expensive apartments with the best views. This includes the recent $37 million sale of a 5,276-square-foot four-bedroom penthouse on the 40th floor, with views of Central Park, the Hudson River and the George Washington Bridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That price makes the apartment one of the five or six most expensive condos ever traded in Manhattan -- and the third highest sale yet at 15 Central Park West, even taking into account far larger units. The price works out to more than $7,000 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sanford I. Weill, the former chairman and chief executive of <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, paid $42.4 million, or $6,287 a square foot, for a full-floor penthouse atop the tower facing Central Park, widely regarded as the most luxurious apartment in the building. Mr. Weill signed a contract in May 2006 and closed at the end of August 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean that 15 Central Park West hasn't been the scene of some disappointments during the downturn. Gotham Makker, an investor and former portfolio manager at the <span class="companylink">Citadel Investment Group</span>, sold a 28th-floor apartment at an $800,000 loss in August, according to property records. He bought it in spring 2008, at the peak of the Manhattan market, for $13.3 million, nearly double the original sale price of the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the visions of $100 million apartments in the building have been dashed, at least for the time being, by the recession. Richard Wallgren, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens, who represented the developers in the original sales, was needled by other brokers when an $80 million listing he posted last year at 15 Central Park West was cut to ''only'' $47 million in February, possibly the largest price cut ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out Mr. Wallgren was overreaching even with that price. But the apartment has sold for $37 million, according to brokers briefed on the transaction, and the chuckles have died down. The seller was identified as Amit Ben-Haim, a London investor who in 1999 made a fortune through the $400 million sale to <span class="companylink">Johnson &amp; Johnson</span> of an Israeli medical device company founded by his brother.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment has five and a half bathrooms, and the sale price includes a separate 1,100-square-foot ground-floor apartment for employees or a home office. Brokers say that a smaller high-floor apartment has also gone into contract recently for a price well over $20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The building is uniquely positioned, better than any other building in Manhattan, to go up in price,'' said Ryan Sherman, a broker and a principal at Metropolitan Residential Partners, who recently sold two apartments there. ''Anything above the lower floors that was always desirable is continuing to rise in value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Mr. Sherman represented Bruce Kaye, a real estate executive with interests in Atlantic City, in the sale of his 2,367-square-foot two-bedroom apartment on the 32nd floor for $11.7 million, or nearly $5,000 a square foot. Mr. Kaye and his wife, Deborah, bought the apartment in April 2008 for $7.8 million, and realized a gain of 50 percent in 17 months. The purchaser was an international shipping executive, brokers said.</p>

</p><div>LIVING IN BOERUM HILL, BROOKLYN</div>
<div>Real Estate Desk; SECTRE</div>
<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Subway Lines Galore, but Who's Leaving?</span>
</div><div class="author">By JEFF VANDAM   </div><div>1540 words</div><div>4 October 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AFTER 37 years in their house on Dean Street in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, Norman and Roselyn Kopit decided last summer that it was finally time for a change of scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their children had moved out, and work had just finished on their living-room ceiling, so the time seemed right. They had bought the house for $43,000; when their broker now priced it at $2.495 million, they smiled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the sale, they could have gone somewhere far from the sleepy, tree-canopied streets of their old neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead they relocated five blocks away. On State Street, an easy distance from all their friends and favorite restaurants, they found a roomy duplex condominium with a kitchen bigger than their old one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaving the area that they had helped bring back from the dead was never really considered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why would I want to move?'' asked Ms. Kopit, 65, who used to manage the office at BusinessWeek magazine. ''I've invested a lot into this neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their investment, part of the countless hours of community effort to transform Boerum Hill from a place of rooming houses, drugs and prostitution to an elegant, family-friendly enclave, has paid off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kopits' block of Dean Street was the one described in ''The Fortress of Solitude,'' Jonathan Lethem's novel about the area in the 1970s, which described ruined row houses sheltering creepy boarders, and a pervasive feeling of decay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Boerum Hill is long gone; today it is clean slate sidewalks, self-conscious cafes and neighbors who do more than merely say hello.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I love the fact that people just drop in,'' said Stephen Antonson, an artist who lives with his wife, Kathleen Hackett, and their two young boys in a house on Pacific Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you have a life where people just come over and knock on your door, there's something about that I really, really like.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvements continue. On almost any block in Boerum Hill, you can find a stoop railing being replaced, a garden being dug up, a crew hauling in a new Viking range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And at the edges of the neighborhood, where zoning allows, developers have put up buildings not always in sync with the local town house vibe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood's boisterous thoroughfare is Atlantic Avenue; it carries a significant amount of traffic and is home to the Brooklyn House of Detention, whose future has been known to generate cacophonous debate. (Bail bondsmen still do business in the area.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But save for that noisy artery, the renovation noises and the conversation of neighbors, the streets are largely quiet -- a cool calm that has lately attracted a variety of independent boutiques and restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, the Kopits would have packed the family into the car and driven to Manhattan to find stuff to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now, we don't have to drive anywhere to find interesting places,'' Ms. Kopit said. ''We just start walking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even by brownstone Brooklyn standards, Boerum Hill is small. It has roughly 20,000 people, according to a 2005 neighborhood association study. The exact street boundaries can be a subject of local disagreement, but the surrounding areas are Cobble Hill, downtown Brooklyn, Park Slope and Gowanus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is it uniformly full of brownstones. Many blocks have unbroken walls of tall red-brick houses with the occasional outlier, like the artist Susan Gardner's bejeweled facade on Wyckoff Street. In 1973, a small historic district was created; some would like to see it expand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the sometimes fast-paced Atlantic Avenue, it has become an unlikely haven for independent shops and boutiques. Hip retailers have helped create a quirky shopping district, like Jonathan Adler, the home store; Blue Marble, the Hudson Valley ice creamery; and Omala, an active-wear dealer that recently advertised an item called ''Zen pants.'' Between Third and Fourth Avenues, Atlantic is home to Middle Eastern commerce, at Fertile Crescent Middle Eastern Groceries and Makkah Islamic Books and Clothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is shopping elsewhere, too. Boerum Hill claims a trendy stretch of Smith Street as its own, and small cafes and stores are dotted throughout the neighborhood's interior, like the restaurant Building on Bond and the Brooklyn Circus boutique. On Fourth Avenue, bars like Cherry Tree and Pacific Standard have sprung up. There are also two Vietnamese sandwich shops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just outside the neighborhood are new developments -- or at least they are promised, on handsome banners. Dean Street alone has at least five construction projects finished or under way. On State Street, a long row of unadorned new town houses has been occupied for a few years now; a project of six more called Ensemble, at prices reportedly ranging from $3.5 million to $4 million, is being considered. Taller projects have arrived north of Atlantic Avenue as well. On Smith, opposite the House of Detention, the Nu Hotel has opened within a new residential tower, with nightly rates starting above $300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those new condominiums don't come cheap, but they are still inexpensive compared with similar properties in Manhattan. At the ''eco-luxury'' building Green on Dean, for example, two-bedroom two-bath units with private balconies and 1,150 square feet of space range from $695,000 to $799,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meat and potatoes of Boerum Hill real estate will always be town houses, and while they are still selling, prices have come down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whatever you could sell for $2.3 million at least two years ago, you'd be lucky to get $1.9 million for now,'' said Allen Barcelon, a broker at Boerum Hill Realty. At the same time, down payment requirements have gone up, Mr. Barcelon said; 20 to 25 percent is now the norm, versus 10 percent in the boom years. Making purchases these days definitely has its challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But houses are still changing hands. Sue Wolfe and James Crow, brokers at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, have sold several town houses this year and have another in contract. A one-family house on Dean Street, which hadn't had any improvements in 20 years and which sold as part of an estate, went for $1.725 million. A two-family house on Wyckoff Street that had been renovated and used by one family sold for $1.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-ops are not plentiful, but can still be found carved out of town houses or occasionally in apartment buildings. In the elevator building at 422 State Street, for example, Mr. Crow and Ms. Wolfe have listed a two-bedroom co-op with one and a half baths for $599,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental prices here have dipped as of late, but transactions still move quickly, Mr. Barcelon said; studios average $1,300 a month, one-bedrooms $1,900, and two-bedrooms $2,300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 35th annual Atlantic Antic, a sort of supersize street fair, takes place Sunday along Atlantic, with 10 stages of free music, lots of food, pony rides, belly dancing and other amusements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for more permanent distractions beyond shopping and dining, there are two movie theaters just outside the area in Cobble Hill and Brooklyn Heights. Prospect and Fort Greene Parks are a short walk (or bike ride) away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 478 students at Public School 38 on Pacific Street, 67 percent of third-, fourth- and fifth-graders met city English standards last year; 86 percent were proficient in math. At the Math and Science Exploratory School, a middle school on Dean Street, scores have improved in recent years, with 97 percent of all students meeting standards on math tests and 90 percent in English.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAT averages last year at the Brooklyn High School of the Arts, also on Dean Street, were 439 in reading, 438 in math and 435 in writing. Citywide averages were 435, 459 and 432.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given its size, Boerum Hill is spoiled with choices of public transit into Manhattan. Ten subway lines stop at the Atlantic Avenue-Pacific Street station at the eastern end of the neighborhood; and six come into the Borough Hall/Court Street station, a few blocks north of State Street. The F and G trains stop at the Bergen Street station, providing another travel option into Midtown (or, via the G, into Queens).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There once was an actual hill called Boerum, used strategically during the Revolutionary War, but it was razed. As Brooklyn grew up, the neighborhood was part of an amalgam simply called South Brooklyn. The population grew after the Atlantic Avenue train tunnel was built in 1844. The area was developed by Charles Hoyt and Russell Nevins; two streets now bear their names. With the Brooklyn Bridge and trolleys came even more newcomers, many of them immigrants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After World War II, disrepair and squalor seeped in, only to be shaken off by renovation-happy brownstoners -- who persevere to this day.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAYONNE -- ERICA BAUMWOLL, who began work as a teacher in New York City three years ago, spent the first year of her career living with two roommates in a cramped third-floor walk-up on the Upper East Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then she bolted to Hoboken. She still had two roommates, but ''way more space,'' said Ms. Baumwoll, 25. She was paying more than the $1,400 per month that she had paid in Manhattan, however, and she could never find a parking space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So last summer she came up with another solution: moving with her boyfriend, Tal Arman, 25, into a spacious two-bedroom two-bath place in a new building. She now has access to a resort-style pool, free garage parking, and a 9,000-square-foot clubhouse that offers a fitness studio, a basketball half-court, a business center, a media lounge and a game room. Her half of the rent is $1,400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, there was a catch: location. The couple's new home is here on a peninsula jutting into the Hudson, out of the urban thick of things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Baumwoll's commute to Manhattan is now about 45 minutes, via shuttle bus to the light rail station, connecting to the PATH train in Hoboken. Mr. Arman's commute takes about the same length of time, though he drives to work in Dover. ''It is worth it,'' they both say of the trade-offs that came with deciding to be among the first renters at the first building at the Alexan CityView, part of a 544-unit complex being built on a former military base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We could never have afforded this in New York or Hoboken,'' Ms. Baumwoll said, ''even if we could have found something this nice and new.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is precisely the way many renters are thinking and prioritizing now, says Jacqueline Urgo, the president of the Marketing Directors Inc., comparing the trend at the Alexan with her company's experiences leasing several other new rental buildings in northern New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Renters today are starting to look more and more like condo buyers with their priorities, and the way they explore all their options,'' said Ms. Urgo, whose company is also directing sales at four or five sites. ''They don't just identify a location and look within the four square blocks. They are looking all over the state for the best values, more so than they ever have.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I see a lot of people not wanting to stretch themselves financially so much as they have in the past,'' she added. ''They want the cushion of values offered further out from the city, and the amenities they are able to garner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Alexan, which opened in June, a one-bedroom can be had for less than $1,500 a month, with a month's free rent prorated across a lease of at least 14 months. Apartments range from studios to three-bedrooms. Of the 165 units in the first building, 120 are occupied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Springfield, a Union County community near Summit and Short Hills, every apartment but one has been leased at the new 93-unit Skyline Ridge building, which opened in April. That building, similarly, offers Manhattan skyline views, nearby train stations, good highway access and relatively low prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Saddle Brook, a small suburban town in Bergen County, a new 158-unit midrise complex with ''condo quality'' finishes and luxury common space is also close to fully leased after an April opening, Ms. Urgo noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that complex, called 140 Mayhill, rates are set to be about half what they would be in Manhattan, and 25 to 30 percent below those in Hoboken, said Jonathan Moore, a vice president at the Value Companies, the developer. Also, a month's free rent was offered with a 14-month lease, and various other perks were initially offered to attract residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, Mr. Moore said, the rental ''concessions'' were phased out after the pace of leasing gained momentum. ''It started to feed on itself,'' he said. ''People discovered us -- this suburban enclave eight miles from the city, surrounded by all major highways, train station with parking five minutes away, bus stop 1,000 feet from the building -- and we started to get strong referrals, people moving in and bringing their friends.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As at the Alexan, whose developer is Trammel Crow Residential, and Skyline Ridge, built by Garden Homes, the majority of renters are under 40, although there is a mix of ages, Mr. Moore said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the economy still so shaky, all of the developers said they recognized that renters were searching beyond ''the usual suspects,'' as Mr. Moore put it -- in other words, beyond glittering and trendy apartments in Hoboken and Jersey City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Baumwoll said that although she and her boyfriend had started out looking for a place in Hoboken, ''we couldn't afford any nice ones.'' She described the reasonably priced places as having ''problems -- no dishwasher, smelled bad, floor caving in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another new renter at the Alexan, the Rev. Mary Anne Glover, who is an interim regional minister for the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), said she had made an intensive six-month search of rental buildings in the New York and New Jersey area to find the best price and amenity package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Ms. Baumwoll, she started out in Manhattan, after moving from North Carolina two years ago. ''I had to pay $400 a month for a parking space,'' said Ms. Glover, whose position requires frequent travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she realized she would be staying in the area for several years, she looked for an apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. ''They wanted $1,900 for a studio, no A.C., no ceiling fan, no parking,'' she said. It was at that point that she started haunting online sites like rent.com, making visits to new buildings, picking up brochures and calculating prices per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I found this place,'' she said, ''all the little perks -- they even get the trash at your door -- I knew I had done my homework, and discovered the best situation at the best price.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT turns out the other half -- or at least the tiny slice who live at the top of the wealth pyramid -- are not sleeping any better than the rest of America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a closed-door meeting of advisers to family offices -- which serve families who typically are worth more than $500 million -- I learned that the super-rich are just as concerned about the future as everyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the stock market has rebounded from its March 9 low, the family office advisers said many of their wealthiest clients were bracing for more bad news and wondering how it would affect their family unity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are now looking at financial planning and things middle-class families live by,'' Kathryn McCarthy, a leading adviser to wealthy families, including the Rockefellers, said at the gathering this week convened by Bessemer Trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before you start laughing up your sleeve, be advised that this is not a good thing. When the super-rich get cold feet, the rest of America gets swine flu. They are, after all, the people who might finance new companies that create jobs, make big investments to support existing companies and spread their wealth throughout the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a study the Family Office Exchange plans to release this month, the super-rich are most worried about what they do not know. Some 45 percent of the 108 ultrahigh-net-worth families surveyed in August ranked the economy and financial markets as their No. 1 concern. They were most concerned about government intervention in the financial markets and a commercial real estate bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, the super-rich have focused mostly on family dynamics, since so much of their wealth is linked together and could be endangered by a rift. But the sudden decline in wealth -- even if they still have hundreds of millions of dollars -- has prompted soul-searching. The bad news is they are not confident about the American economy. The better news is they are looking at their families in a way that the average American could learn from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MORE THAN MONEY What is most interesting is that many of the super-rich are looking at the risks of their relatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the big problems is how differently people within a family spend, save and invest money that has been managed as a pool for many generations. When the credit markets froze and the stock market tumbled, not every cousin agreed to tighten his alligator-skin belt. That caused friction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some family members with money in individual trusts are opting to go off on their own. The bigger issue is when families have to cooperate to run the business the patriarch set up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, family businesses and family wealth were commingled. If the business was struggling, the patriarch would often finance shortfalls. ''Now the kids are upset about where the money is going,'' said Holly Isdale, managing director at Bessemer. ''Intrafamily dynamics are playing a bigger part in decisions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the family put in place a strict estate plan, the children may legally own a good portion of what the patriarch made. And now they have choices to make that may go against his wishes. ''These families have recognized that autopilot is not a good strategy,'' said Amelia Renkert-Thomas, a lawyer with <span class="companylink">Withers Bergman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other risk to super-rich families is government action and increased regulation. They suspect it is coming but do not know how it will affect them. The result is that they are increasingly anxious about the future while still shell-shocked from the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are telling them not to make changes for the sake of making changes,'' said Theodore Beringer, managing director of the Beringer Group, a family office adviser. ''First, they need to find out what needs to be changed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RETURN TO BASICS Figuring out what they need to do differently has prompted many super-rich families to ponder the same question as the rest of us: How did the boom years change us?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basic issue for them is deciding what they want to do as a family now that they realize they cannot do everything. ''You're worth $500 million one day and wake up the next and it's $350 million and you've pledged $100 million to the Met,'' said Rob Elliott, senior managing director at Bessemer. ''What are the family's goals? Is it philanthropy or bringing along the next generation?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coming up with an answer has been complicated by second-guessing: should they, or could they, have done something differently? ''They're human -- they sell too soon and they buy too high,'' Mr. Beringer said. ''It used to be, 'I'm going to buy A and B.' Now it's, 'I'll buy A or B.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bigger choice is what they do as a family when members are against both A and B. If that is left unresolved, tensions can fester.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NO MORE EASY MONEY One reason for the subprime mortgage collapse was that banks gave mortgages to homebuyers without verifying their ability to repay. The super-rich had their own version of this: the signature loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, a person's net worth would be verified but not, say, the value of the building she was buying. The feeling was if someone was worth $1 billion, she would have no problem paying back a loan for a $100 million office tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This gave the super-rich access to quick financing, for both hard assets like real estate and assets like securities. ''There's a realization that we can't borrow any more to goose our returns,'' Ms. McCarthy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now banks want loans secured by a verifiable asset, and the super-rich are not borrowing as much. This has translated into a more conservative approach over all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing the group convened by Bessemer agreed on is that their clients were hesitant to buy commercial real estate. They fear that the value of it could collapse with greater ferocity than the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The logic behind this is that with everyone cutting back -- companies laying off workers, consumers watching what they buy -- there is less demand for office and retail space. If leases expire and are not renewed, building owners will have trouble making their loan payments. That, in turn, will affect the investors who bought the bonds secured by this debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even those real estate owners who are doing well could be hurt. ''A lot of this debt is short term and it needs to be refinanced, but there is no market for that,'' Ms. Isdale said. Next year and 2011 are expected to be the worst, Ms. McCarthy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So while the super-rich bought properties on the cheap in previous real estate downturns, they now may be struggling with the financing on the ones they own and wary to add more, even at discount prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, super-rich families are focused on having cash on hand. One of the other uses of signature loans had been to pay for a lifestyle. Until a few years ago, many banks advised wealthy families to have 100 percent of their wealth invested to take advantage of the high returns across asset classes. If they needed cash, they could borrow at a low rate. It was easy, until it was not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They've realized they can't have everything,'' Ms. McCarthy said. ''Now they're asking, Is it worth it? That's a question everyone should be asking.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By JIM ATKINSON   </div><div>1428 words</div><div>2 October 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>33</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Playa del Carmen, Mexico -- Forty miles down the Riviera Maya coast via Mexico 307, I was a world away from the relentless hubbub of Cancún, rolling along a narrow, winding flagstone road to the ocean through mangrove so thick that it blocked the sun in spots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last 15 years, as Cancún's growth has begun to max out, vacationers and retirees have looked to the Riviera Maya, the 100-mile stretch of blue-green Caribbean and bleached white sand that stretches south to Tulum. There are now a total of 35,000 hotel rooms, condominiums and timeshares on a coast that not long ago was largely fishing villages backed by scrubland and verdant jungle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is a kind of anti-Cancún. That resort town, Mexico's most famous, is all about the vertical, the high density, the buzz and the next margarita. The Riviera, though, is about the horizontal (resorts can't be more than four stories), low density (developers can build on only 5 percent of their land), environmental sustainability, diving the world's second-longest barrier reef (after the Great Barrier in Australia) and climbing the Mayan ruins at Tulum and Coba.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a few miles down the highway,'' said Laura Zapata, president of the Riviera Maya branch of A.M.P.I., the Mexican association of real estate professionals. ''But it's a different universe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, that's what Ara Der Sarkissian, 36, of Los Angeles, felt he was getting when two years ago he plopped down $1.3 million for a 1,500-square-foot beachfront condo at Rosewood Mayakoba, in the Mayakoba resort complex here being developed by OHL, a Spanish company. Mr. Sarkissian took a second mortgage on property he owns in Los Angeles, where he is a broker at his family's real estate firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just that the beach was so beautiful,'' he said, recalling that he fell in love with the place back in 2007, when he visited while on a cruise to nearby Cozumel. ''This property can be anything you want to make of it -- formal or laid-back.'' Mr. Sarkissian said that because he stayed at the property only five to seven weeks out of the year -- Rosewood leases it the remainder of the time -- he has been able to pay off his loan and all fees to Rosewood and pocket a little profit most months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mexican economic growth forecasters expect the Riviera Maya to experience a 15 to 20 percent decline in sales of such seven-figure-and-up properties, like Banyan Tree's villas, and so appreciation of existing properties may slow as well. But it will be decelerating from a growth of 19.5 percent in 2007 -- which is why Mr. Sarkissian said he thought his property was worth $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sarkissian is one of about 10,000 Americans who are property owners here; they constitute about 5 percent of the Riviera Maya's total population of 235,000. The rest are an amalgam of Canadians, Europeans, Latin Americans and Mexicans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayakoba -- a 1,600-acre development that will eventually feature 1,000 rooms and residences under the flags of Banyan Tree, Fairmont, Viceroy and Rosewood properties -- has given the Riviera Maya a bit of a snooty reputation. But it is actually a demographically ecumenical place, one long mall of second-home possibilities that stretches from the lofty heights of Mayakoba to the more modest Playa del Carmen, where Paul Ilg, 75, and his wife, Geri, 69, of Clarkston, Mich., bought a home. The Ilgs decided to live half the year in what is Riviera's fastest-growing beach town after Mr. Ilg's retirement a decade ago from <span class="companylink">General Dynamics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though neither speaks much Spanish, plays golf or scuba dives, after a vacation here in 1999 they found a two-bedroom condo in the heart of town for $79,000, which they paid cash for by taking a second mortgage on their home in Michigan. They enjoy long walks along the town's funky Fifth Avenue -- 10 blocks of nonstop restaurants, cantinas, jewelry and T-shirt shops -- and the ''sweetness'' of the town, despite the fact that its population has tripled in the time they've lived there. It doesn't hurt that Mr. Ilg estimates that his condo has appreciated to $180,000. (This kind of value is another reason that the American contingent here may be the only truly happy American homeowners I've spoken to lately.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Williams, a retired printing company owner from Seagoville, Tex., visited the region five years ago on a dive trip to Cozumel. He and his wife had always loved the beach life, and so he did some whimsical home hunting in Playa and bought a lot for $150,000 in one of its original gated communities. An airy, 4,000-square foot, $500,000 hacienda wasn't far behind. ''I wake up to the sounds of tropical birds,'' he said. ''We have our own iguana out back. That money's in a better place than it could be. I'm a happy man.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Williams's neighborhood has the air of an established suburb in Southern California. But for a more bohemian feel -- and prices -- the town of Puerto Morelos, about 20 miles north of Playa del Carmen, is probably the ticket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You tell me where you can get beachfront anywhere else in the world for under $300,000,'' said Amber Pierce-Schulz, a local real estate agent, after showing me a one-bedroom, 800-square-foot condominium on the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newest boomtown is Tulum, where the main draw is the ruins of a Mayan seaport. The Riviera can keep propagating fresh generations of condos and villas in a wide range of niches because of that endless beach -- development theoretically can extend another 50 miles south of Tulum, with the exception of lands protected by an ecological reserve, to the border with Belize. But the real secret to its success may have more to do with Cancún and less to do with that vast coastline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Riviera Maya may pose as an anti-Cancún, but it benefits a great deal from the Mexican government's emphasis on public safety and quality health care in and around its most valuable resort town. Though Mexico's nationalized health care system ranks 61st out of 190 systems rated in the world by the World Health Organization in 2000 -- the last time the group did the survey -- care there can cost less than half what it does in the United States, which was ranked 37th in the same survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public safety in Mexico is difficult to make sweeping assurances about these days. But most of the drug cartel violence that has received so much publicity has usually occurred in the nation's border towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, a bigger problem for the Riviera Maya may be continuing to live up to its promise of delivering beauty without the excesses of Cancún. A drive through Tulum revealed the good news that, on the beach side, developments are adhering to low-rise, low-density dictates; but also the bad news that, on the inland side, where developments of ''shoe box'' housing are serving buyers seeking less expensive homes, the beginnings of a backslide can be seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to know if development on Cancún's scale is inevitable, but if that happens, it most likely won't be because of Ray Graham, 74, of Latrobe, Pa., who was relaxing at his hacienda near Bacalar -- said by some to be the next Tulum. Insects swarmed through the air, and the humidity from the nearby lagoon made it difficult to breathe, giving the setting more an aura of the Mosquito Coast than any riviera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Graham and his wife, Reba, 70, had found what they wanted. ''We like it out here,'' he said, wiping sweat from his brow and gazing at the jungle surrounding them. ''It's away from all that in Cancún. Away from everything.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Manhattan Apartment Sales Bounced Back Over the Summer, but Not All the Way</span>
</div><div class="author">By JOSH BARBANEL  </div><div>744 words</div><div>2 October 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>29</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a year of declines in Manhattan co-op and condominium sales, the residential market has perked up enough for real estate appraisers and brokers to at least debate the question on the minds of many New Yorkers: Has the market reached a bottom yet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market reports released on Friday showed that during this year's third quarter, July through September, the number of sales rose steeply from the second quarter, but remained below the levels of last year's third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sale prices moved roughly sideways, with some up and some down, compared with those in the second quarter, though the prices of loft apartments and new condominiums continued to fall, according to third-quarter data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report by one broker, Prudential Douglas Elliman said the number of sales was up 45.6 percent from the second quarter, but down 16 percent from the third quarter of last year. It put the average co-op and condo apartment sale price at $1.32 million, off 10.6 percent from the same quarter in 2008, but up 0.8 percent from the second quarter. Co-op prices were down 5.9 percent from the previous quarter, while condominium prices were up 3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser who, as the president of Miller Samuel Inc., prepares the market report for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that while the Manhattan housing market may be improving in some ways, it had ''not yet found a bottom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller cited high local unemployment, tight credit and a ''shadow inventory'' of new condominiums not officially listed on the market as reasons for pessimism. On the other hand, he noted, sales have picked up and the number of owners listing apartments is falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dorothy Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, was more upbeat. She said that her firm had experienced its busiest summer in years, because buyers who had been ''unwilling to pull the trigger'' in the spring had more confidence in the market. ''We see the market as stabilizing,'' she said. ''It has hit bottom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, another broker, declared that with the rebound in the stock market and slowing job losses, buyers were becoming more comfortable. ''Confidence is returning to the marketplace,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> brokerage firm, said that ''if we are not at a bottom, we are close to it.'' She added that the rise in sales and the decline in inventory were strong signs of an improving market at a time when the Wall Street bonus season is approaching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said listings in September had fallen to the lowest level in a year and were nearly 10 percent below the level of a year ago, when the economy staggered after the bankruptcy of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet despite the increase in sales, she said she had seen little evidence that prices will rise significantly in the near future. In fact, she said, the average sale price on Upper East Side town houses is still 50 percent below the price in the first quarter of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared the market reports for Brown Harris Stevens and another brokerage, Halstead, said that despite the surge in sales and increased confidence, prices of large Upper East Side apartments with three or more bedrooms lagged 42 percent below the prices of a year ago, and 12 percent below the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that during the third quarter of last year, there were eight sales of apartments for more than $20 million, including two for over $40 million and four others between $30 million and $40 million. In the last quarter, he said, there was only one sale of more than $20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Elliman report put the average sale price of a co-op at $1 million and the median price at $630,000. It found that the average price of a condominium was $1.58 million, while the median price was $1.02 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spring is usually the busiest season for apartment sales in Manhattan. But Mr. Miller said that because sales in the spring were chilled by difficult economic conditions, the usual surge in sales happened later, during the third quarter, rather than in the second quarter. ''The spring market in effect occurred this summer,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two decades ago the French designer Philippe Starck shaped the interiors of the Paramount and Royalton boutique hotels in Midtown Manhattan, even choosing the drooping aluminum doorknobs and checkerboard carpets. Ian Schrager, an owner of the hotels, stashed away examples of the furnishings and their prototypes in his homes and storage units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Wright auction house in Chicago will offer about 70 of Mr. Schrager's Starck pieces in a sale that Richard Wright, the auction house owner, concedes probably would have attracted larger or at least more nostalgic crowds in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Yorkers and tourists of ''a certain age,'' he said, ''have good memories of being at those hotels when they were the chicest places.'' He suggested, only half facetiously, that his sale should set off a preservationist outcry for the hotel furniture to be returned to Manhattan. ''Let's make a call out to New Yorkers: 'Save your '80s and '90s heritage,' '' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The auction estimates range from $100 for a whale-shaped corkscrew to $7,000 for 10 three-legged plywood chairs. The relatively low prices, Mr. Wright said, reflect bidders' possible trepidation about rare custom works by Mr. Starck, who has also designed mass-production wristwatches and lemon juicers. ''He has a very commercial side that the collector world hasn't embraced yet,'' Mr. Wright said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers may also wonder about the user-friendliness of Mr. Starck's designs. Three side chairs in the Wright sale (estimated at $1,500 to $2,000) have aluminum prongs for backs, and velvet armchairs ($2,000 to $3,000 for a pair) lean disconcertingly backward. Prospective buyers are encouraged to take a seat at the preview. ''Comfort is in the body of the beholder,'' Mr. Wright said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subtle Restorations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Gardner Museum</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isabella Stewart Gardner insisted in her will that no one be allowed to change the ''arrangement of any articles'' in her Boston museum, which she modeled after 15th-century Venetian palaces. But since her death in 1924, various staffs have subtly brought order to her quirky arrangements of old master paintings, ancient statues and Renaissance furniture amid colorful fabric wall coverings and chunks of medieval buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things were tidied up over the years, even though directors had been very respectful,'' said Alan Chong, the collection's curator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since April the staff has been restoring Mrs. Gardner's displays in the Yellow Room, a ground-floor gallery of late 19th- and early 20th-century art. Mrs. Gardner originally used the space as a men's cloakroom and restroom for lavish parties, then filled it with her collection of portraits and landscapes by Matisse, Degas and Whistler, all hung against a yellow 1790s silk backdrop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1974 the walls were recovered in matte yellow cotton that ''looked just awful,'' Mr. Chong said. At some point white track lights were hung from the ceiling, and Mrs. Gardner's irregular rows of paintings were neatened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday the room reopened with fiber-optic bulbs illuminating a reproduction of the original lemony damask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We found a sample to copy in our textile collection that had never been exposed to light,'' the curator said. The silk's scrollwork pattern has been quirkily applied to run sideways in a few spots, and the paintings' mismatched frames now follow the same zigzags that Mrs. Gardner laid out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She wanted the rooms to look old and lived in and changed over time,'' Mr. Chong said. ''That was part of the fun, the feeling of history having already taken place here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Film Producer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is Selling Antiques</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Ivory, the usually limelight-shy film director, spent an hour with a reporter at a Midtown Manhattan diner the other day, leafing through a catalog for his auction on Wednesday at Christie's in London. He is selling about 300 objects that belonged to Ismail Merchant, his companion and business partner, who died in 2005 after ulcer surgery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 40 years, Mr. Ivory explained, Mr. Merchant collected antiques obsessively and eclectically. ''Often I didn't know about what he'd bought until I came home, and there it was,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple kept apartments in Mumbai, London, Paris and New York in addition to a country house in upstate New York. At auctions and galleries near the homes or on location for movie shoots, Mr. Merchant acquired pieces with shiny surfaces and lively, flared shapes. His silver Indian side chairs have rams' heads along the top rails (a set of six is expected to bring about $2,000 at Christie's). His 19th-century fabric from Uzbekistan (estimated around $13,000) is embroidered with rosemary sprigs, and gilded eagles sprout from the heads of his 1810s bronze Isis figures (around $12,000 for two).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ivory reminisced about auction lots that had played roles in his life: Champagne flutes and mahogany armchairs that he used on movie sets, a silver walking stick that Mr. Merchant always asked the forgetful cleaning lady to polish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many of the antiques have no sentimental value for Mr. Ivory, since he found them only after Mr. Merchant died. A set of 1840s watercolors of Indian forts, temples and cliffs (estimated at $6,500) was ''just wrapped up and tucked under suitcases in a closet,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He plans to attend the auction but will probably not sit with the public, he said. Ever the director, he is concerned about the audience's reaction. ''Do they want to see my jubilation if something goes for a lot of money,'' he asked, ''or my depression if it doesn't sell?''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Playa del Carmen, Mexico -- Forty miles down the Riviera Maya coast via Mexico 307, I was a world away from the relentless hubbub of Cancun, rolling along a narrow, winding flagstone road to the ocean through mangrove so thick that it blocked the sun in spots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last 15 years, as Cancun's growth has begun to max out, vacationers and retirees have looked to the Riviera Maya, the 100-mile stretch of blue-green Caribbean and bleached white sand that stretches south to Tulum. There are now a total of 35,000 hotel rooms, condominiums and timeshares on a coast that not long ago was largely fishing villages backed by scrubland and verdant jungle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is a kind of anti-Cancun. That resort town, Mexico's most famous, is all about the vertical, the high density, the buzz and the next margarita. The Riviera, though, is about the horizontal (resorts can't be more than four stories), low density (developers can build on only 5 percent of their land), environmental sustainability, diving the world's second-longest barrier reef (after the Great Barrier in Australia) and climbing the Mayan ruins at Tulum and Coba.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a few miles down the highway,'' said Laura Zapata, president of the Riviera Maya branch of A.M.P.I., the Mexican association of real estate professionals. ''But it's a different universe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, that's what Ara Der Sarkissian, 36, of Los Angeles, felt he was getting when two years ago he plopped down $1.3 million for a 1,500-square-foot beachfront condo at Rosewood Mayakoba, in the Mayakoba resort complex here being developed by OHL, a Spanish company. Mr. Sarkissian took a second mortgage on property he owns in Los Angeles, where he is a broker at his family's real estate firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just that the beach was so beautiful,'' he said, recalling that he fell in love with the place back in 2007, when he visited while on a cruise to nearby Cozumel. ''This property can be anything you want to make of it -- formal or laid-back.'' Mr. Sarkissian said that because he stayed at the property only five to seven weeks out of the year -- Rosewood leases it the remainder of the time -- he has been able to pay off his loan and all fees to Rosewood and pocket a little profit most months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mexican economic growth forecasters expect the Riviera Maya to experience a 15 to 20 percent decline in sales of such seven-figure-and-up properties, like Banyan Tree's villas, and so appreciation of existing properties may slow as well. But it will be decelerating from a growth of 19.5 percent in 2007 -- which is why Mr. Sarkissian said he thought his property was worth $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sarkissian is one of about 10,000 Americans who are property owners here; they constitute about 5 percent of the Riviera Maya's total population of 235,000. The rest are an amalgam of Canadians, Europeans, Latin Americans and Mexicans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayakoba -- a 1,600-acre development that will eventually feature 1,000 rooms and residences under the flags of Banyan Tree, Fairmont, Viceroy and Rosewood properties -- has given the Riviera Maya a bit of a snooty reputation. But it is actually a demographically ecumenical place, one long mall of second-home possibilities that stretches from the lofty heights of Mayakoba to the more modest Playa del Carmen, where Paul Ilg, 75, and his wife, Geri, 69, of Clarkston, Mich., bought a home. The Ilgs decided to live half the year in what is Riviera's fastest-growing beach town after Mr. Ilg's retirement a decade ago from <span class="companylink">General Dynamics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though neither speaks much Spanish, plays golf or scuba dives, after a vacation here in 1999 they found a two-bedroom condo in the heart of town for $79,000, which they paid cash for by taking a second mortgage on their home in Michigan. They enjoy long walks along the town's funky Fifth Avenue -- 10 blocks of nonstop restaurants, cantinas, jewelry and T-shirt shops -- and the ''sweetness'' of the town, despite the fact that its population has tripled in the time they've lived there. It doesn't hurt that Mr. Ilg estimates that his condo has appreciated to $180,000. (This kind of value is another reason that the American contingent here may be the only truly happy American homeowners I've spoken to lately.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Williams, a retired printing company owner from Seagoville, Tex., visited the region five years ago on a dive trip to Cozumel. He and his wife had always loved the beach life, and so he did some whimsical home hunting in Playa and bought a lot for $150,000 in one of its original gated communities. An airy, 4,000-square foot, $500,000 hacienda wasn't far behind. ''I wake up to the sounds of tropical birds,'' he said. ''We have our own iguana out back. That money's in a better place than it could be. I'm a happy man.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Williams's neighborhood has the air of an established suburb in Southern California. But for a more bohemian feel -- and prices -- the town of Puerto Morelos, about 20 miles north of Playa del Carmen, is probably the ticket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You tell me where you can get beachfront anywhere else in the world for under $300,000,'' said Amber Pierce-Schulz, a local real estate agent, after showing me a one-bedroom, 800-square-foot condominium on the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newest boomtown is Tulum, where the main draw is the ruins of a Mayan seaport. The Riviera can keep propagating fresh generations of condos and villas in a wide range of niches because of that endless beach -- development theoretically can extend another 50 miles south of Tulum, with the exception of lands protected by an ecological reserve, to the border with Belize. But the real secret to its success may have more to do with Cancun and less to do with that vast coastline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Riviera Maya may pose as an anti-Cancun, but it benefits a great deal from the Mexican government's emphasis on public safety and quality health care in and around its most valuable resort town. Though Mexico's nationalized health care system ranks 61st out of 190 systems rated in the world by the World Health Organization in 2000 -- the last time the group did the survey -- care there can cost less than half what it does in the United States, which was ranked 37th in the same survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public safety in Mexico is difficult to make sweeping assurances about these days. But most of the drug cartel violence that has received so much publicity has usually occurred in the nation's border towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, a bigger problem for the Riviera Maya may be continuing to live up to its promise of delivering beauty without the excesses of Cancun. A drive through Tulum revealed the good news that, on the beach side, developments are adhering to low-rise, low-density dictates; but also the bad news that, on the inland side, where developments of ''shoe box'' housing are serving buyers seeking less expensive homes, the beginnings of a backslide can be seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to know if development on Cancun's scale is inevitable, but if that happens, it most likely won't be because of Ray Graham, 74, of Latrobe, Pa., who was relaxing at his hacienda near Bacalar -- said by some to be the next Tulum. Insects swarmed through the air, and the humidity from the nearby lagoon made it difficult to breathe, giving the setting more an aura of the Mosquito Coast than any riviera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Graham and his wife, Reba, 70, had found what they wanted. ''We like it out here,'' he said, wiping sweat from his brow and gazing at the jungle surrounding them. ''It's away from all that in Cancun. Away from everything.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery in housing prices, which first took fragile hold in the spring, became more firmly rooted in the summer, according to data released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price index, a closely watched measure of 20 metropolitan areas, rose a seasonally adjusted 1.2 percent in July from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices increased in 17 of the cities, one more than in June. As recently as March, all had declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are now several months of data in which we have seen improvement,'' said Maureen Maitland, vice president for index services at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>. ''California in particular seems to be showing sustained improvement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news was better than analysts had been anticipating. ''We had not expected such big gains so soon,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist of High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any sense of relief, however, must be considered provisional. The strength of the housing recovery will be put to substantial tests this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $8,000 first-time home buyer tax credit, passed by Congress as part of the stimulus package in February, prompted hundreds of thousands of people to buy sooner rather than later, experts estimated. The credit is scheduled to expire on Nov. 30. If it is not renewed, some prospective buyers will probably wait until better times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are troubled by the prospect of banks' releasing another large supply of foreclosures. Distressed sales were a large reason for plummeting prices last year. Unemployment is still rising, which increases the supply of foreclosures and tends to discourage even those with jobs from buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market needs to deal with these before we can declare absolute victory,'' Ms. Maitland said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts think the recovery is an illusion. Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist of MFR, said he believed the recent rise was merely a correction after the large declines of the winter, when the economy was in free fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe it unlikely that the overall price adjustment seen to date is sufficient to balance supply (which is enormous) with demand,'' Mr. Shapiro wrote in a research note. He added that in the middle and upper range of the market, ''there is likely plenty of pain yet to come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller numbers lag by a month the reports on numbers of new-home sales and existing home sales, both of which are already out for August. The news was not particularly good. Existing sales fell 2.7 percent after four months of gains, while new-home sales were up only marginally after strong gains in June and July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the recovery holds, prices have a long way to go before they recover the ground lost in the last three years. The Case-Shiller numbers include a national index that is back to its 2003 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a seasonally adjusted basis, home prices in San Diego were up 2 percent in July; Los Angeles rose 1.2 percent; and San Francisco increased 2.9 percent. New York rose 0.9 percent, while Minneapolis, the best-performing city, was up 3.1 percent. Without the adjustments, which is how Case-Shiller numbers were reported until recently, the increases were all somewhat greater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declining cities were Seattle, which fell 0.3 percent; Detroit, down 0.4 percent; and Las Vegas, which dropped 1.9 percent. Home prices in Las Vegas, which flew higher in the boom and fell further in the bust, were down by a third over the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another economic report released Tuesday, the Conference Board, a private research group, said that its consumer confidence index dropped to 53.1 in September, from the revised 54.5 reading in August. Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected 57.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mel Vader and Bob Henderson figured that martini hour on the terrace of their apartment in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, would grow only more interesting after Richard Meier built his 15-story glass tower across the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From their sixth-floor perch, the couple have seen a toddler on the eighth floor ride her tricycle around her balcony, and watched a cleaning crew come in after 10 p.m. to sop up after a flood of water poured through six stories. They know which of their neighbors in the Meier building make their beds and which do not, and who wears what while brushing their teeth. On one particularly engaging afternoon, they sat, captivated, as a woman appeared in the living room of a gray-haired bachelor, leading Mr. Henderson to hope for an unfolding romance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like a stage that they set up for us,'' said Mr. Vader, a retired teacher, who occasionally has turned his deck chair away in embarrassment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But 10 months after the much-publicized -- and much-debated -- Meier building opened, most of that stage remains devoid of actors. On the side of the building facing their terrace, Mr. Vader and Mr. Henderson said, there is not a single person living on the 9th, 10th, 12th, 14th or 15th floors. While the developers say half of the building's 99 units have been sold, the real estate Web site StreetEasy.com documents only 25 closings through public records. When the sun falls, the view from Mel and Bob's terrace -- or, for that matter, from the storied Grand Army Plaza -- is not unlike a Christmas tree stripped of all but a handful of lights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You see that there are people there,'' Mr. Vader said. ''But you don't see the amount of movement that you would normally see.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Seventeen Development L.L.C. announced in 2005 that Mr. Meier would erect one of his elaborate glass and steel sculptures on a $4.75 million parcel in Prospect Heights, it was seen as a test of New York's real estate boom. Could the starchitect best known for designing Manhattan condominiums for the likes of Calvin Klein and Martha Stewart sell $1 million one-bedrooms in a still-gentrifying zone without a reliable public school?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the Meier building -- officially, On Prospect Park -- is a wall of windows into the real estate bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with anemic sales, the developers have slashed prices by as much as 40 percent. They combined units -- there were originally 114 -- to boost the percentage sold in order to ease the path to mortgages. But potential buyers have walked away from at least $20 million worth of contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the handful of people who moved in have been left exposed not only to the perils of buying at the peak of the market but also to the stifled laughter of their neighbors following their every move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These pioneers have formed an Internet chat group to trade information about the building's construction progress and ever-dropping sales prices. They have also organized a book club, a tennis team, basketball tournaments, billiard games and myriad individual play dates and cocktail hours in a campaign to create a community within the glass walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people would like to see this building fail,'' said Betty Flynn, a California transplant who pressed her lips together tightly as she paused while describing her hopes for weathering the downturn. ''We all have the same goal. We want to be in a great building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a July meet and greet in the building's fishbowl-like first-floor party room, Ms. Flynn and her neighbors joked about the challenges of living in a Richard Meier building -- about how Mr. Meier, who himself lives in a prewar Manhattan co-op crowded with 5,000 books, hides the microwaves in minimalist kitchens and favors pale walls that quickly grow covered with children's fingerprints. They swapped stories about having food delivery show up across the street at the Brooklyn Public Library, since their building took its address, 1 Grand Army Plaza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One woman said that seeing a unit similar to hers on the market for 30 percent less made her ''heart sink,'' while a couple apologized for negotiating more than $1.1 million off the $2.8 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residents have tried to maintain a sense of humor about the attention they have attracted for living in a glass tower, especially one that many local residents decried for changing the character of the streetscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One father sighed that he had probably been spotted chasing his naked toddlers through his apartment before bath time. Alan Fleischer, the bachelor seen with the female guest, clarified that she was there to clean the place, but said he had ordered curtains in case that special someone comes along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, the residents of the glass house wave at Mel and Bob enjoying martinis on their terrace across the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Richard Meier has brought the outside inside for these people, but he's brought their interiors to everyone outside,'' Mr. Vader said. ''I get to see more than they get to see.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many in their neighborhood, Mr. Vader and Mr. Henderson -- who have lived for 15 years in a grand traditional apartment with a sweeping circular staircase, period paintings and a shaggy-leaved ficus named Tina (as in Turner) -- at first staunchly opposed the idea of a totem of modern architecture being planted in the heart of their beloved Brownstone Brooklyn. They wrote to officials at the neighboring Brooklyn Public Library, botanical garden and Prospect Park, pleading for a design that blended better with the low-rise apartment buildings and the 11-acre oval plaza and arch designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in the 1860s. Their pleas went unheeded. But the couple soon found themselves engrossed in the construction of what looked like a giant erector set in front of their terrace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a ballet,'' said Mr. Vader, 66, arms waving to mimic the dancing cranes. ''That initial opening of the earth with those extraordinary mechanicals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Noise, noise, noise,'' piped in Mr. Henderson, 68, and retired from retail. ''But it was fascinating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ruth Dropkin, who is 90 and has lived nearby for 31 years, was moved to write an ode to the building called ''Narcissus Ascending,'' which she sent, unbidden, to The New York Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The naked steel girders go/up in hubris steps,'' she wrote. ''Gone the haven of brick and stone and wood,/gone the primal niche of interiority.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the local residents debated the exterior, the developers and sales brokers were preoccupied with what was not going on inside as potential buyers struggled to obtain mortgages on apartments whose values were rapidly falling. Two Corcoran brokers handling sales at the building have not had an open house for months and repeatedly refused to let a reporter watch shoppers browse the empty units. Information supplied by the sales center to StreetEasy.com shows that even units that have gone to contract are taking extraordinarily long to close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louis Greco, one of the three principals in the development company, said in an interview that he could afford to wait to sell units because the money he borrowed for the project carried a low interest rate. ''We're prepared to ride the storm,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The person perhaps least affected by the emptiness of the glass house is Mr. Meier. He said that he had never met with the bankers financing the project until he was honored for the building's design this summer at the 2009 Building Brooklyn Awards, hosted by the local Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a sunset cocktail reception on the roof of Steiner Studios at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Mr. Meier, 74, said that hewas not affected by the building's sluggish sales because the developer ''cut the prices after it was finished.'' He said that On Prospect Park was hardly unique among new developments being stagnated by the recession, and that he ''definitely'' would be game to build in Brooklyn again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The people who live there love it,'' Mr. Meier added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the first to gamble on the glass house were Edith Asibey and John D. Verlander, first-time buyers who signed a contract in March 2008 for a $950,000 one-bedroom on the sixth floor with 1,091 square feet and a 108-square-foot terrace. Three days before Ms. Asibey and Mr. Verlander closed on the apartment, in the back of the building, their bank, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, nearly pulled out -- despite their down payment of nearly 30 percent -- partly because of concerns over how few units had sold. They eventually closed in March 2009, amid new worries about the trouble buyers with less cash or worse credit could face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can see it's going to be very difficult in the near term to get this building filled up,'' said Mr. Verlander, 30, a consultant for a major accounting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now they are relishing their relative privacy. Ms. Asibey, 39, a consultant for nonprofit groups, said she does not worry about leaving a pile of clothing before rushing out to appointments. Still, she showed off how much thicker her bedroom blinds were than the ones in the living room, proof that privacy is possible even in the glass house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment that caused them so much grief while they were trying to obtain a mortgage has started to feel like a home filled with memories. Ms. Asibey lovingly described the first major meal Mr. Verlander cooked for them in their new kitchen. It was April 11. Spinach salad with applewood smoked bacon, Valdeon cheese and a sherry vinaigrette, followed by braised beef brisket with truffle mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Before a dessert of chocolate and strawberry ice cream from the Blue Marble shop down the street, Mr. Verlander got down on bended knee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There, in full view of the neighbors, the pair of distant figures became engaged. ''All the shades were up,'' Ms. Asibey said. ''But I wasn't looking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Flynn, 66, a retired school administrator, and her husband, Gary, a lawyer who is 64 and also retired, moved into a $1.45 million one-bedroom on the fourth floor in January after three years in the building where Mr. Vader and Mr. Henderson live (they knew the Flynns well enough to advise Mr. Flynn to shut the bathroom door when brushing his teeth). The Flynns had moved to the neighborhood from California to be closer to their daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren, who live in Carroll Gardens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a little disheartening to think we bought at the height'' of the market, Ms. Flynn said. But, her husband noted, ''we're living here for the rest of our lives. We know there are ups and downs in the market. It's not a time to panic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have tried to comfort some of their younger neighbors who are more apprehensive about surviving a real estate bust. Through years of buying and selling real estate, Ms. Flynn said, they figure it ''all comes out in the wash.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, they have become pillars of the community growing in the building. Mr. Flynn has formed friendships playing pool with neighbors, while Ms. Flynn helped start a book club, which has already read ''Arrowsmith'' by Sinclair Lewis and ''The Defiant'' by Shalom Yoran, who happens to live on the fifth floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yoran, an 84-year-old retired chairman of an aircraft company, and his wife, Varda, who is 80, moved into their $3.1 million four-bedroom in December, after deciding they were too old to care for their sprawling home in Great Neck on Long Island. He is a Holocaust survivor who fought as a partisan in the forests of Eastern Europe (his memoir should not be confused with ''Defiance,'' a movie based on a similar story). She is a sculptor who said she was not worried about declining real estate values because her next condo would be a coffin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the Flynns, they moved to be closer to their children and grandchildren, who live a few blocks up Flatbush Avenue. The apartment, which feels like a treehouse nestled among the leafy branches across Plaza Street, smells like coffee and has a studio with a cage of 15 chirping finches, and a spare bathroom with a tub lined with toys for a grandchild's sleepovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born in China to Russian Jews, Mrs. Yoran moved at age 20 to Israel, where she met Mr. Yoran, whose parents died in the Holocaust, and who, according to his book, spent one winter in ''a freshly dug, carefully constructed, and well-camouflaged hole in the ground secluded deep in the forest.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Yoran said that she did not know how much value her glass house had lost, but that she trusted in her husband's ''sixth sense,'' which had guided them through their lives. Mr. Yoran's eyes still sparkle as he watches his wife of 55 years move among her abstract stone artworks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They do not mind if Mel or Bob or anyone else peeks inside the home that took their whole lives to find.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What I like about this is, the inside out and the outside in,'' said Mrs. Yoran, gesturing toward the glass. ''It's a matter of perspective.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IMAGINE the agony of a buyer when the bank's appraiser rules that the apartment the buyer has agreed to pay $750,000 for is worth only $650,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What then?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer has three options: move on, because the low appraisal means the mortgage the bank will give is too small to buy the apartment; scramble to come up with a larger down payment to make up for the smaller loan; or use the appraisal to try to renegotiate the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents, mortgage brokers and appraisers all say that the low-ball appraisal has become increasingly common in today's unsettled market. The problem is even more pronounced when homeowners are hoping to refinance a mortgage or get a home equity loan, because there is no current agreed-upon sale price as a benchmark, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low appraisals may reflect reality, since prices in New York City have dropped by as much as 30 percent in the last year. But agents, mortgage brokers and even some appraisers say they suspect that some appraisals are mistakenly low. They cite several reasons:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, with sales volume having dropped by nearly 50 percent at the beginning of the year and only recently having reached more normal levels, appraisers are often hard pressed to find the comparable sales that allow them to come up with accurate appraisals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a market where you have very little data points, you could have a totally unique property where there just aren't a lot of comparables,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the Manhattan appraisal firm Miller Samuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, at a time when local expertise is crucial, recent changes in national lending practices have resulted in the assignment of many appraisers who are not familiar with local markets, brokers and appraisers say. Some real estate agents say that in recent months they have fielded requests regarding Manhattan listings from appraisers from New Jersey, Suffolk County and the Hudson Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Vargas, a principal at Vanderbilt Appraisal in Manhattan, said that because of a major change in the appraisal process that took effect on May 1, appraisal assignments are often shifted ''to appraisers who charge the least amount.'' But, Mr. Vargas said, ''very often those individuals are not the most experienced in your market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy change, known as the Home Valuation Code of Conduct, essentially prohibits real estate agents and mortgage brokers from ordering appraisals, and gives total control to banks and lenders. The change was intended to eliminate conflicts of interest and to prevent brokers from pressuring appraisers to come back with a specific dollar figure that might just happen to be the purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most banks are using appraisal management companies, which are national businesses that act as middlemen and typically assign appraisals to appraisers who offer lower fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller and Mr. Vargas say that in New York, that means appraisals that usually cost $350 to $450 are often now being done for half those amounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The potential pitfalls are not exclusive to New York. ''The least qualified and least experienced people are doing appraisals across the country,'' said Jim Amorin, the president of the Appraisal Institute, a national trade group that represents 26,000 appraisers. He estimated that appraisal management companies now handle about 90 percent of the appraisal market, up from about 30 percent before May 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Amorin said he had heard of appraisers in California who travel 150 to 200 miles to do an appraisal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard to believe that they could still be in their geographically competent area,'' he said. ''And in Manhattan it would be even harder if you have someone coming in from the suburbs, since things can be vastly different from one side of the street to another.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subtleties like the inherently higher value of a second full bathroom in a two-bedroom than in a one-bedroom, or the difference between addresses on Lexington Avenue and First Avenue, can be lost on someone who doesn't know Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And without a stockpile of comparable sales for reference, Mr. Miller said, ''you have to really know the local market, so you can go beyond the raw sales data and use all the subjective factors you can to really tell the story about a property.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, an appraiser with a 203 or 516 area code doesn't necessarily lack expertise in Manhattan or Brooklyn. On the other hand, an unfamiliar prefix can signal unfamiliarity with this neck of the woods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dean Feldman, an executive vice president at Halstead Property, said that he recently met with an out-of-town appraiser for a two-bedroom apartment that had been combined from a studio and a one-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This person did not understand what a combined apartment was, and he kept asking me if there were two deeds for it,'' Mr. Feldman said. ''I had to explain that this was a co-op and it was a legal combination. It turned out fine, but I basically had to teach him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the real estate market was rising, appraisals often came in higher than sales prices, as appraisers struggled to keep up with ever escalating prices. In the current down market, brokers say appraisers are now erring in the other direction -- giving lower values since they know banks are reluctant to make loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisals are one part science and, especially in a down market, many more parts art. An appraiser can use a tape measure or sonar device to calculate square footage, but how much a recent kitchen renovation is worth and what dollar figure to attach to a park view or a doorman is strictly subjective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisers readily acknowledge that two appraisers reviewing the same apartment will inevitably come up with two different values, but they add that experts in the same market are not likely to be more than 1 to 2 percent apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since most banks do not send an appraisal to potential borrowers until just before or even after a scheduled closing, a buyer does not have time to challenge an appraisal that he or she believes to be too low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If an appraiser missed a bedroom or outdoor space, we used to be able to show them documentation was incorrect,'' said Ellen Bitton, the president of Park Avenue Mortgage Group. ''But now there's no way to challenge a faulty appraisal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the current climate, banks are even less open to reconsidering decisions because most have already increased their scrutiny of loan applications and do not want any appearance of impropriety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only thing you can do is prepare at the outset,'' Mr. Vargas said. ''Find out who is doing the appraisal and how experienced they are in the market and voice your concerns with the loan officer and if necessary, you can decline to make the appointment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can ask the bank to send a different appraiser, but the bank does not have to comply, which means you risk losing the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most proposed sales, appraisers call real estate agents for an appointment to view the property. For a refinancing, they call the homeowners directly. Mr. Miller advised that appraisers always be met directly by the agent or homeowner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Humanize it and provide relevant data to the appraiser,'' he said. ''Let them know that the apartment across the street just sold for less than this one, but you know it was a fixer-upper.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles Homet, a senior vice president at Halstead, said that ''appraisals are kind of cloaked in mystery'' and that most appraisers tend to be tight-lipped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like a restaurant inspector,'' Mr. Homet said. ''They need to appear to be above influence. But I always make sure I have relevant comps in hand and I'm prepared to discuss as much as the appraiser is willing to listen why I think the price is supported.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that in addition to recent sales in the same or nearby buildings, he also provides prices of apartments that have just gone into contract that may not yet have been put into the public record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Feldman of Halstead said that since the market tends to ''like'' some buildings better than others, he makes that clear if he's dealing with an appraiser unfamiliar with a neighborhood or a specific building. ''I can point out that it's closer to the park or to <span class="companylink">Citarella</span> than the nearest comp, or maybe I know that a more expensive apartment a few floors higher has a much better view because it clears the town houses across the street,'' he said. ''I try to share as much information as I can, so they're armed with the proper tools to make a decision.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melissa Cohn, the president of Manhattan Mortgage, says the new appraisal world means that to best serve clients, real estate and mortgage brokers should fully vet potential borrowers, to make sure they qualify before they even submit a loan application.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cohn noted that because of low appraisals, new developments in particular have been susceptible to failed deals. Buyers who signed contracts a year or two year ago are likely to receive appraisals significantly lower than the prices they agreed to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Ms. Cohn's clients had signed a contract in 2007 for a $3.5 million condo. But as the closing date approached recently, the client's bank denied the mortgage because the appraisal came in at $3.1 million. The client started the process all over with a second bank, and that bank's appraiser found comparables among buyers who had closed at their original purchase prices; he came up with a $3.5 million appraisal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So the second appraiser's opinion was the value was there, because people were paying those prices,'' Ms. Cohn said. However, she added, purchase prices in new developments are not always actual prices, since many developers are agreeing to pay closing costs or offering other financial concessions. ''It just shows you how nebulous the actual value can be,'' she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORKERS, meet the latest neighborhood: North TriBeCa. Not to be confused with the rest of TriBeCa, a k a the Triangle Below Canal, a neighborhood that historians say entered the general parlance around 1970.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or at least that's the view of two real estate professionals, representing a 20-block area in northwestern TriBeCa, who have decided it's time to secede from the neighborhood at large. They maintain that the northwest is distinguished from the rest by its warehouse architecture, lack of retail and office buildings, and cobblestoned streets. They are also selling real estate there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a real neighborhood,'' said Gerard Longo, a principal of the development company Atlantic Walk Vestry who has several buildings in the newly named area. ''It's not something we created. It's something we wanted to make the public more familiar with.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TriBeCa proper, with its center at Franklin and Hudson Streets, has contemporary high-rise apartment buildings and office towers, along with national retail franchises, Mr. Longo said. But North TriBeCa is set apart by having little else but late 19th-century and early 20th-century manufacturing warehouse buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That lends itself to this beautiful architecture, which has high ceilings, round-topped windows, arched brick patterns and elaborate cornice work,'' he said. ''A good portion of North TriBeCa is in a historic district.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the buildings are residential conversions or new buildings that replicate turn-of-the-last-century industrial buildings, like the Fairchild at 55 Vestry Street, between Washington and Greenwich Streets, or the Pearline Soap Factory at 414 Washington Street and Laight Street. Both were developed by Mr. Longo, who also did 408 Greenwich Street nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of new development in TriBeCa, and a lot of it leaves a lot to be desired,'' said Raphael De Niro, a managing director with the real estate brokerage Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate, who is marketing apartments at the Fairchild for $1,200 to $1,600 a square foot. ''I feel like we should differentiate ourselves a bit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. De Niro stressed the difference between North TriBeCa's buildings and the 40-story high rises with glass curtain walls being constructed in the eastern portion of TriBeCa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That part of TriBeCa feels more like the financial district,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the well-known are typically reticent about their neighborhood allegiances, North TriBeCa has apparently been discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Celebrities seem to be very comfortable with North TriBeCa,'' said Mr. De Niro, whose father is the actor Robert De Niro. For instance, according to published reports, the pop star Justin Timberlake has bought a three-bedroom condominium at the Pearline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though a handful of working warehouses remain to be converted, Mr. De Niro said that in about a decade, North TriBeCa was ''going to feel like an extension of the West Village.'' In fact, Mr. Longo says he believes the area already evokes the West Village of 25 years ago. This may be no coincidence, as real estate in the Village currently sells for a hefty $1,140 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate professionals have been criticized and praised for taking advantage of neighborhood nicknames; one example is Dumbo, in Brooklyn, which stands for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this kind of renaming is not a recent phenomenon, according to the architectural historian Barry Lewis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When New York annexed the Bronx in the 1870s,'' he said, ''the real estate people wanted to call it the 'Great North Side.' But everybody else called it the 'Annexed District,' which is nowhere near as tony.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first contemporary neighborhood, Mr. Lewis said, was Greenwich Village, a slum adopted and renamed by literary figures and artists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These bohemians reached back into history and resurrected the name 'Greenwich,' except they added 'Village' to it,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''And suddenly, they were living in 'Greenwich Village.' They were not living on the 'Lower West Side' or the 'Ninth Ward.' The Italians next door were living in the 'Ninth Ward.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1960s, when artists were priced out of Greenwich Village, they moved south of Houston Street to the first acronym neighborhood: SoHo. Once priced out of there, they moved farther south and created TriBeCa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you gave a party in 1968, and you lived on Leonard Street or White Street off of Broadway, nobody had any idea where that was,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''People would say, 'Is that in Manhattan?' By giving it an acronym, you gave it a sense of place in the firmament of New York.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowadays, he said, names like FiDi for the Financial District, or Nolita for North of Little Italy, have become big business in real estate. Professionals bank on making those new names stick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of this has to do with how much people buy into it, literally,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''And in Manhattan, where you have people buying apartments for $1 million or more, the names get pretty serious, because they want to feel they bought into something chic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In actual fact, Mr. Lewis believes that contemporary city neighborhoods are more realistically determined by shopping needs -- ''where you can reasonably walk to buy something and schlep it back home.'' But he said he wasn't surprised at real estate professionals' trying to rebrand neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no stone left unturned on Manhattan Island,'' he said. ''Any little corner of quiet, they're going to exploit somehow and market it, because of the real estate value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaun Osher, the president and founder of Core, a real estate marketing company, said dividing neighborhoods for marketing purposes -- for instance, differentiating West Chelsea from Chelsea proper -- might make sense. But in his view TriBeCa is already one of Manhattan's smallest neighborhoods, and thus is too small to be subdivided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a marketing ploy, I'd say buyers who come to TriBeCa are among the more sophisticated, and they're not going to fall for it.''</p>

</p><div>LIVING IN MOUNT HOPE, THE BRONX</div>
<div>Real Estate Desk; SECTRE</div>
<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Easy on the Wallet; on the Eye, Too</span>
</div><div class="author">By C. J. HUGHES   </div><div>1516 words</div><div>27 September 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NATURE has abhorred vacuums along Walton Avenue in Mount Hope, a diamond-shaped neighborhood in the occasionally rough central Bronx.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1980s, when torched or abandoned apartments were razed -- particularly in the East 176th Street area -- patches of tall grasses and flowers quickly took their place. In many ways, the hardy meadows probably resembled those that blanketed the area until the mid-1800s, when the advent of the New York and Harlem Railroad station down the street began encouraging development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is only within the last few years that a new wave of apartment building has swept across Mount Hope, snatching back those green spaces again for human settlement -- in this case, low-income renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radiance Brown sees the repopulation as marking a return to the Mount Hope of 1973, when she moved from Brooklyn to Morris Avenue, into a two-family Beaux-Arts row house whose bowed facade and bracketed cornice evoke the South End in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then her husband, Charles, paid $65,000 for the home, plus $10,000 in renovations. The roof and windows were replaced, as well as the plumbing and electrical systems, but the plaster moldings are still in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Ms. Brown said, the building might sell for $650,000; she bases her estimate on a recent listing on her block. Both also now sit in a city historic district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mount Hope's improvements represent a personal victory for Ms. Brown, who organized neighbors to clean sidewalks when the city wouldn't. As she put it: ''We grabbed brooms and went where the garbage was. It was work, work, work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mount Hope Housing Company, which she helped found in 1986, symbolizes her determination. Today the company, which creates affordable housing, has 32 buildings in its portfolio, most of them in Mount Hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost all the units in those buildings are low-income rentals. But the company is about to strike out in a slightly new direction, with New Hope Morris, a 39-unit condominium scheduled for occupancy in February. Though its units, too, will have income restrictions, they will be among the few new homes for sale here in years, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attracting buyers should be a priority for Mount Hope, said Glen Hardwick, who as a local homeowner knows that homeowners tend to take better care of their property than renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need a middle class here, because it's all low-income now,'' said Mr. Hardwick, as he leaned on a cane by a row of green peppers in the 176th Street Community Garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His theory is that there is so much affordable housing in Mount Hope that it is depressing the value of his two-bedroom co-op, which he said his mother bought for $4,000 in 1981.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that he is nostalgic for those times, which he remembers as dominated by gangs hanging out across the street. Nowadays, he said, ''a lack of a parking is the only major problem we have.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As its name suggests, Mount Hope sits on a rise. Its 80 blocks are bounded on one side by the Cross Bronx Expressway and cut down the middle by the Grand Concourse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the housing stock consists of six-story Depression-era apartment buildings interspersed with attached wood-frame homes, whose derivative Queen Anne styles -- as seen along Anthony Avenue by Prospect Place -- occasionally have flourishes like turrets topped with domes. Multiple electric meters on their facades suggest that they are multifamily dwellings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the two-family houses along Townsend Avenue, near Clifford Place, dress themselves up with peaked lancet-arch doorways and a medley of brick courses. And Topping Avenue's slightly sagging row houses, near the rush of the expressway, have friezes adorned with garlands and shields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also residential towers, like the enormous 1880 Valentine Avenue, erected as part of a 1970s urban-renewal project. It has 167 units, ranging in size from studios to two-bedrooms. They start at $739 a month, and can be subsidized through Section 8 vouchers, according to the building's rental office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, rentals make up 96 percent of the housing units in this neighborhood of about 46,000 people, according to census data. That compares with 70 percent for the city as a whole. Almost all of Mount Hope's rental housing is subsidized, according to local officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the population is foreign-born, census data show. Forty-one percent said they were from the Dominican Republic; there were also contingents from Jamaica, Ecuador and Guyana. And among the 31 percent who described themselves as African were populations from the western countries of Ghana, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 46th Precinct, which encompasses Mount Hope, continues to struggle with crime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2001 to 2008, the murder rate dropped by 12 percent, from 17 to 15; the city as a whole recorded a 19 percent drop. Over that time, grand larceny actually increased by 7 percent in Mount Hope, to 450 from 422, while it went down 5 percent citywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statistics tell only part of the story. ''Is it in-your-face kind of stuff? No,'' said Xavier Rodriguez, the district manager of Bronx Community Board 5, which represents the area. ''But indoor drug-dealing is horrendous.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more fundamental challenge, Mr. Rodriguez said, is that Mount Hope has four homeless shelters. One of them, Susan's Place, is in a one-story building at 1921 Jerome Avenue; another, at 115 Henwood Place, is in a 14-story high-rise. They add a transient population that doesn't have the neighborhood's best interests at heart, he explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have that many homeless people in the Bronx,'' Mr. Rodriguez said, ''so the city must ship them here from elsewhere in the four boroughs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the city's Department of Homeless Services disagrees. Kristy Buller, a spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail message that while ''37 percent of families entering intake come from the Bronx,'' 35 percent of shelters are in the Bronx.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because there are so few homes to buy and sell in Mount Hope, analyzing the market is difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first six months of 2009, for example, only two homes sold, according to StreetEasy, the real estate research company. The average price of those two homes -- one single-family, one two-family -- was $222,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, only two homes -- both two-families -- sold in the first six months of 2006, near the market's peak. Their average price was $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental prices are fairly consistent. At the 104 income-restricted units of the new Walton Henwood Apartments, studios start at $691, a sign in front says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the street, at New Hope Walton, which began leasing in June, one-bedrooms start at $800. Those rents are comparable to what people pay in older buildings, give or take $100 a month, brokers and community leaders say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Public School 28 on Anthony Avenue, 68 percent of fourth-graders met standards on the state reading exam last year, while 88 percent did in math. Citywide, the figures were 69 percent and 85 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intermediate School 117, also known as the Joseph H. Wade School, was less successful: 36 percent of eighth-graders met standards in reading, 60 percent in math, versus 57 and 71 citywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the next step, the William Howard Taft Educational Campus is nearby and houses six high schools. Only three have been open long enough to have recorded SAT scores, and averages are considerably lower than the city's as a whole. At Bronx Expeditionary Learning, for example, averages last year were 333 in reading, 338 in math and 328 in writing, versus 435, 459 and 432 citywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 4, B and D subway lines serve Mount Hope, delivering passengers to Midtown in about 20 minutes. Two buses, BxM4A and BxM4B, run express down the Grand Concourse to Midtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women and children walked hand in hand down East Burnside Avenue on a recent Saturday afternoon. They passed Fino, a clothing store that offered three suits for $200, and Rehoboth Fish Market, which displayed plastic bins full of shrimp on ice. Pastel-colored bird cages filled a pet store window.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Julius Richman Park, huge outcroppings form an eye-catching backdrop for recreation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Grand Concourse, which opened in 1909, was one of the first ''grade-separated'' roads outside of a park, according to Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx historian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mount Hope had very few buildings when the road went in -- although the flatiron-shaped No. 1882, at East Tremont Avenue, had already gone up. It was once the borough's tallest building, Mr. Ultan said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROXBURY -- JUST as the leaves are beginning to turn along the country lanes, Stacey Matthews is anticipating a fall season that will transform the local housing market as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearing the end of a sales year so abysmally slow that the number of houses sold in Roxbury only ticked into the double digits last month, Ms. Matthews, an agent with William Raveis, has country homes galore to sell here in this part of Litchfield County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She can offer houses connected with luminaries, houses with drop-dead views, and more than a few with impeccable interiors. But while her target buyers -- those in line for fat Wall Street bonuses -- have begun to browse in Litchfield over the past month or so, ''prime'' isn't the only descriptor they're looking for in a weekend property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody wants a deal,'' Ms. Matthews said. ''That's their No. 1 concern.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, an air of resignation mingles with the scent of fall these days in the Litchfield hills. Throughout a region known to affluent weekenders as the anti-Hamptons, sale prices are generally down about 30 percent from asking, agents said. Many of the properties on the market have been heavily discounted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, deep discounts don't mean much if a property is grossly overpriced at the start, but the lower prices, accompanied by dramatic drops in overall sales volume, are a reflection of this market's hypersensitivity to slumps on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we offer is a luxury, and it's an unnecessary luxury,'' said Gael Hammer, an agent with Klemm Real Estate in Washington Depot. ''You can live without your second home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10 closed sales in sparsely populated Roxbury during the first eight months of the year represented half of last year's volume. Rates of decline were similar in Washington (15 sales), Bridgewater (4) and Warren (5).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales activity has definitely picked up since July. Klemm reports that 20 properties, worth a total of $30 million, in lower Litchfield are either under contract or ''on the verge'' of a contract since early August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the wait for this uptick has been painfully long. During previous recessions, the market's ''finite'' number of houses offered greater protection, said Mr. Hammer, who has sold in the area for 25 years. In those instances, inventory was never too far out in front of demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, the countryside has suffered more than some of its suburban neighbors. According to data from William Raveis, as of the end of August, many towns in the county's lower half had at least four years' worth of inventory, based on the existing pace of sales. Buyers are using the surplus to their advantage: a house on 29 acres on the Washington side of Lake Waramaug is under contract for upward of $4 million, close to $2 million less than the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At this point,'' Ms. Matthews said, ''I don't even want to take listings from people who just want to test the market and see if they can get their price. They should just wait for five years, because buyers aren't interested.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is busily cutting prices on the listings she already has. Just last week, she reduced the price on the colonial in Roxbury where the literary lion William Styron wrote and entertained for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still owned by Mr. Styron's widow, Rose, the five-bedroom house is well suited to the weekender lifestyle, with an Adirondack-styled great room, a saltwater pool and a two-bedroom guest house. The downside is the old, worn kitchen, along with other needed updates. It was listed in May for $2.2 million; the new price is $1.895 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere in town, a 6,000-square-foot Georgian colonial that appears to fulfill even the most demanding checklist has been on and off the market for two years or more. Arresting backyard view? Check, with an infinity-edge pool. Updated interiors? Check, complete with lower-level media room. Ample acreage? Seven. And even better, the property is on a dirt road, a ''chichi thing,'' as Ms. Matthews put it, in a place where nearly everybody's playing at living the rural lifestyle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, only since the sellers lowered their price to $2.895 million from the original $3.2 million have buyers started asking serious questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the designer-perfect renovation across from the television actor Michael Lombardi's house. Expanded, designed and furnished by the owners of the Tulip Tree Collection, a furniture store in Washington Depot, the house has the kind of kitchen that comes with two of everything (dishwashers, sinks, et cetera.).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detail-oriented buyers would presumably swoon for the basket-weave patterned floor in the foyer (inspired by a French chateau), the varied tray ceilings, and the raised fireplace in the dining room (affording seated guests equal gazing privileges).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally offered at $2.75 million, the house is now down to $2.195 million, with rental as an option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second-home slowdown forced Wayne Piskura, the former owner of Tierney Realty in Roxbury, to merge his agency with Klemm. A fixture in the Roxbury market since the early 1990s, Mr. Piskura says he is hopeful that the worst is over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've got three little tiny deals I'm working on -- three $250,000 deals. But,'' he added, ''that's a lot better than I was doing last winter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: WORDY ACRES: Literary associations have not yet sold the home of William Styron in Roxbury, above, which has been listed six months.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An answer in the Q &amp; A column last Sunday about the effect on shareholders of the bankruptcy or foreclosure of a co-op cited an inapplicable statute. New York has not adopted the Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Oct 04 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep the Money Bag</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Home, Please</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q I have always wondered what paying ''cash'' at a closing means. Does that mean a cashier's check, a personal check, or a bag of money? What are the benefits and risks to the buyer and seller?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A The term ''cash'' in a real estate transaction generally refers to the portion of the purchase price paid from the buyer's own cash reserves, said Douglas Wasser, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When there is a large cash component, he said, the seller's risk that the sale will collapse is reduced because the deal is less dependent on a bank's appraisal and review. Also, the buyer will have a greater personal investment in the deal and that may make a co-op board more likely to approve the sale, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales contract should specify cash and mortgage components. ''It's rare that a significant component of the purchase price would be payable in actual paper currency,'' Mr. Wasser said, ''though many real estate attorneys have their 'war stories' about parties bringing bags full of cash to closings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that all funds required at closing, including ''cash'' that is due from the borrower, are payable by bank check or certified check, with minor amounts at the closing table payable by personal check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Hot Seat</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over Air-Conditioning</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q I am a rent-stabilized tenant in a New York City co-op building that has two separate management companies: one for the co-op, one for the stabilized apartments. Recently, the building's central air-conditioning system failed. Who is responsible for maintaining these services in my unit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Sean A. Altschul, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, says that a typical proprietary lease requires the apartment corporation to keep building systems in good repair. In this case, he said, the co-op corporation is probably responsible for repairs to the central air-conditioning system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the first step for the tenant, he said, is to notify the landlord of the problem in writing and to provide copies of the notice to both management companies. If the problem is not resolved promptly, the tenant may file a complaint with the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the evidence indicates that the air-conditioning has not been restored, the agency can reduce the rent for the apartment and issue a written order directing the landlord to have the service restored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Aftermath</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of a Co-op Foreclosure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q A number of shareholders are seriously in arrears in maintenance payments at my co-op, and the building's mortgage payment was not made last month. What happens if the co-op goes bankrupt or is foreclosed on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A If a co-op receives a foreclosure notice, it must transmit a copy of that notice to all shareholders under the state's Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act, said Steven D. Sladkus, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This notice is important because if the co-op declares bankruptcy or is foreclosed upon, not only will the shareholder's equity be lost, but all shareholders who have co-op loans would remain responsible to each of their lenders to pay their loans off in full,'' Mr. Sladkus said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, he said, all proprietary leases would be canceled, and the shareholders would become rental tenants.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Kevork S. Hovnanian, 86; Founded Building Company</span>
</div><div class="author">By BARRY MEIER   </div><div>575 words</div><div>27 September 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>28</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevork S. Hovnanian, who came to the United States from Iraq and started a construction company that became one of the nation's largest home builders, died on Thursday in Manhattan. He was 86 and lived in Rumson, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. of Red Bank, N.J., announced his death on its Web site but did not disclose the cause. He founded a building company, with his three brothers in 1959.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Hovnanian, a publicly traded company that operates in 18 states, was the sixth-largest builder of homes and residences in the country, based on revenue. Affected by the nationwide housing downturn, it reported a net loss of $1.1 billion for the year that ended in October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hovnanian was among the developers who transformed the shape of suburbia in the 1970s and 1980s by building inexpensive town houses and condominiums for young families who were first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even among competitors, he gained a reputation as a builder of bare-bones homes who kept prices low. In the early 1980s, for example, the typical Hovnanian condominium residence was a two-bedroom, two-bathroom dwelling that cost about $30,000. In his developments, Mr. Hovnanian kept prices down by omitting the amenities, like swimming pools and community buildings, that other builders used to attract buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are limited recreation facilities going in because people have little time for socialization,'' Mr. Hovnanian told The New York Times in 1983, explaining his philosophy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 1989, his company had sold more than 30,000 condominiums and other residences in states stretching from New Hampshire to Florida. The projects were so popular that they sometimes sold out over a weekend. Mr. Hovnanian also operated a finance company that made loans to buyers, who sometimes bought more than one residence, including some as investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the company has built more than 200,000 other homes. And in recent years, it has expanded its portfolio to include the construction of medium-price homes, luxury homes and retirement communities with recreational facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hovnanian, who was of Armenian descent, fled Iraq with his brothers and other family members in the late 1950s as a result of political upheaval there. In 1986, he fulfilled a promise he had made to himself during his escape by building an Armenian Apostolic church in Long Branch, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also contributed money to help build medical facilities in the New York area, including the K. Hovnanian Children's Hospital at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hovnanian and his three brothers, Hirair, Jirair and Vahak, put in $1,000 each, in addition to a borrowed $20,000, to start the company, <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. said in a news release on its 50th anniversary. The other brothers left the business in 1969. Hirair and Vahak, both of Middletown, N.J., survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1988, his son, Ara K. Hovnanian, succeeded him as president of <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises</span>, replacing his father as its chief executive in 1997. The elder Mr. Hovnanian remained chairman of the company until his death. Besides his son, who lives in New York, he is survived by his wife, Sirwart; four daughters, Sossie Najarian, Esto Barry and Lucy Kalian, all of Rumson, N.J., and Nadia Rodriguez, of Boston; and 13 grandchildren.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mel Vader and Bob Henderson figured that martini hour on the terrace of their apartment in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, would grow only more interesting after Richard Meier built his 15-story glass tower across the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From their sixth-floor perch, the couple have seen a toddler on the eighth floor ride her tricycle around her balcony, and watched a cleaning crew come in after 10 p.m. to sop up after a flood of water poured through six stories. They know which of their neighbors in the Meier building make their beds and which do not, and who wears what while brushing their teeth. On one particularly engaging afternoon, they sat, captivated, as a woman appeared in the living room of a gray-haired bachelor, leading Mr. Henderson to hope for an unfolding romance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like a stage that they set up for us,'' said Mr. Vader, a retired teacher, who occasionally has turned his deck chair away in embarrassment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But 10 months after the much-publicized -- and much-debated -- Meier building opened, most of that stage remains devoid of actors. On the side of the building facing their terrace, Mr. Vader and Mr. Henderson said, there is not a single person living on the 9th, 10th, 12th, 14th or 15th floors. While the developers say half of the building's 99 units have been sold, the real estate Web site StreetEasy.com documents only 25 closings through public records. When the sun falls, the view from Mel and Bob's terrace -- or, for that matter, from the storied Grand Army Plaza -- is not unlike a Christmas tree stripped of all but a handful of lights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You see that there are people there,'' Mr. Vader said. ''But you don't see the amount of movement that you would normally see.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Seventeen Development L.L.C. announced in 2005 that Mr. Meier would erect one of his elaborate glass and steel sculptures on a $4.75 million parcel in Prospect Heights, it was seen as a test of New York's real estate boom. Could the starchitect best known for designing Manhattan condominiums for the likes of Calvin Klein and Martha Stewart sell $1 million one-bedrooms in a still-gentrifying zone without a reliable public school?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the Meier building -- officially, On Prospect Park -- is a wall of windows into the real estate bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with anemic sales, the developers have slashed prices by as much as 40 percent. They combined units -- there were originally 114 -- to boost the percentage sold in order to ease the path to mortgages. But potential buyers have walked away from at least $20 million worth of contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the handful of people who moved in have been left exposed not only to the perils of buying at the peak of the market but also to the stifled laughter of their neighbors following their every move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These pioneers have formed an Internet chat group to trade information about the building's construction progress and ever-dropping sales prices. They have also organized a book club, a tennis team, basketball tournaments, billiard games and myriad individual play dates and cocktail hours in a campaign to create a community within the glass walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people would like to see this building fail,'' said Betty Flynn, a California transplant who pressed her lips together tightly as she paused while describing her hopes for weathering the downturn. ''We all have the same goal. We want to be in a great building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a July meet and greet in the building's fishbowl-like first-floor party room, Ms. Flynn and her neighbors joked about the challenges of living in a Richard Meier building -- about how Mr. Meier, who himself lives in a prewar Manhattan co-op crowded with 5,000 books, hides the microwaves in minimalist kitchens and favors pale walls that quickly grow covered with children's fingerprints. They swapped stories about having food delivery show up across the street at the Brooklyn Public Library, since their building took its address, 1 Grand Army Plaza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One woman said that seeing a unit similar to hers on the market for 30 percent less made her ''heart sink,'' while a couple apologized for negotiating more than $1.1 million off the $2.8 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residents have tried to maintain a sense of humor about the attention they have attracted for living in a glass tower, especially one that many local residents decried for changing the character of the streetscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One father sighed that he had probably been spotted chasing his naked toddlers through his apartment before bath time. Alan Fleischer, the bachelor seen with the female guest, clarified that she was there to clean the place, but said he had ordered curtains in case that special someone comes along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, the residents of the glass house wave at Mel and Bob enjoying martinis on their terrace across the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Richard Meier has brought the outside inside for these people, but he's brought their interiors to everyone outside,'' Mr. Vader said. ''I get to see more than they get to see.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many in their neighborhood, Mr. Vader and Mr. Henderson -- who have lived for 15 years in a grand traditional apartment with a sweeping circular staircase, period paintings and a shaggy-leaved ficus named Tina (as in Turner) -- at first staunchly opposed the idea of a totem of modern architecture being planted in the heart of their beloved Brownstone Brooklyn. They wrote to officials at the neighboring Brooklyn Public Library, botanical garden and Prospect Park, pleading for a design that blended better with the low-rise apartment buildings and the 11-acre oval plaza and arch designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in the 1860s. Their pleas went unheeded. But the couple soon found themselves engrossed in the construction of what looked like a giant erector set in front of their terrace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a ballet,'' said Mr. Vader, 66, arms waving to mimic the dancing cranes. ''That initial opening of the earth with those extraordinary mechanicals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Noise, noise, noise,'' piped in Mr. Henderson, 68, and retired from retail. ''But it was fascinating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ruth Dropkin, who is 90 and has lived nearby for 31 years, was moved to write an ode to the building called ''Narcissus Ascending,'' which she sent, unbidden, to The New York Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The naked steel girders go/up in hubris steps,'' she wrote. ''Gone the haven of brick and stone and wood,/gone the primal niche of interiority.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the local residents debated the exterior, the developers and sales brokers were preoccupied with what was not going on inside as potential buyers struggled to obtain mortgages on apartments whose values were rapidly falling. Two Corcoran brokers handling sales at the building have not had an open house for months and repeatedly refused to let a reporter watch shoppers browse the empty units. Information supplied by the sales center to StreetEasy.com shows that even units that have gone to contract are taking extraordinarily long to close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louis Greco, one of the three principals in the development company, said in an interview that he could afford to wait to sell units because the money he borrowed for the project carried a low interest rate. ''We're prepared to ride the storm,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The person perhaps least affected by the emptiness of the glass house is Mr. Meier. He said that he had never met with the bankers financing the project until he was honored for the building's design this summer at the 2009 Building Brooklyn Awards, hosted by the local Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a sunset cocktail reception on the roof of Steiner Studios at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Mr. Meier, 74, said that he was not affected by the building's sluggish sales because the developer ''cut the prices after it was finished.'' He said that On Prospect Park was hardly unique among new developments being stagnated by the recession, and that he ''definitely'' would be game to build in Brooklyn again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The people who live there love it,'' Mr. Meier added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the first to gamble on the glass house were Edith Asibey and John D. Verlander, first-time buyers who signed a contract in March 2008 for a $950,000 one-bedroom on the sixth floor with 1,091 square feet and a 108-square-foot terrace. Three days before Ms. Asibey and Mr. Verlander closed on the apartment, in the back of the building, their bank, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, nearly pulled out -- despite their down payment of nearly 30 percent -- partly because of concerns over how few units had sold. They eventually closed in March 2009, amid new worries about the trouble buyers with less cash or worse credit could face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can see it's going to be very difficult in the near term to get this building filled up,'' said Mr. Verlander, 30, a consultant for a major accounting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now they are relishing their relative privacy. Ms. Asibey, 39, a consultant for nonprofit groups, said she does not worry about leaving a pile of clothing before rushing out to appointments. Still, she showed off how much thicker her bedroom blinds were than the ones in the living room, proof that privacy is possible even in the glass house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment that caused them so much grief while they were trying to obtain a mortgage has started to feel like a home filled with memories. Ms. Asibey lovingly described the first major meal Mr. Verlander cooked for them in their new kitchen. It was April 11. Spinach salad with applewood smoked bacon, Valdeon cheese and a sherry vinaigrette, followed by braised beef brisket with truffle mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Before a dessert of chocolate and strawberry ice cream from the Blue Marble shop down the street, Mr. Verlander got down on bended knee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There, in full view of the neighbors, the pair of distant figures became engaged. ''All the shades were up,'' Ms. Asibey said. ''But I wasn't looking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Flynn, 66, a retired school administrator, and her husband, Gary, a lawyer who is 64 and also retired, moved into a $1.45 million one-bedroom on the fourth floor in January after three years in the building where Mr. Vader and Mr. Henderson live (they knew the Flynns well enough to advise Mr. Flynn to shut the bathroom door when brushing his teeth). The Flynns had moved to the neighborhood from California to be closer to their daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren, who live in Carroll Gardens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a little disheartening to think we bought at the height'' of the market, Ms. Flynn said. But, her husband noted, ''we're living here for the rest of our lives. We know there are ups and downs in the market. It's not a time to panic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have tried to comfort some of their younger neighbors who are more apprehensive about surviving a real estate bust. Through years of buying and selling real estate, Ms. Flynn said, they figure it ''all comes out in the wash.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, they have become pillars of the community growing in the building. Mr. Flynn has formed friendships playing pool with neighbors, while Ms. Flynn helped start a book club, which has already read ''Arrowsmith'' by Sinclair Lewis and ''The Defiant'' by Shalom Yoran, who happens to live on the fifth floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yoran, an 84-year-old retired chairman of an aircraft company, and his wife, Varda, who is 80, moved into their $3.1 million four-bedroom in December, after deciding they were too old to care for their sprawling home in Great Neck on Long Island. He is a Holocaust survivor who fought as a partisan in the forests of Eastern Europe (his memoir should not be confused with ''Defiance,'' a movie based on a similar story). She is a sculptor who said she was not worried about declining real estate values because her next condo would be a coffin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the Flynns, they moved to be closer to their children and grandchildren, who live a few blocks up Flatbush Avenue. The apartment, which feels like a treehouse nestled among the leafy branches across Plaza Street, smells like coffee and has a studio with a cage of 15 chirping finches, and a spare bathroom with a tub lined with toys for a grandchild's sleepovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born in China to Russian Jews, Mrs. Yoran moved at age 20 to Israel, where she met Mr. Yoran, whose parents died in the Holocaust, and who, according to his book, spent one winter in ''a freshly dug, carefully constructed, and well-camouflaged hole in the ground secluded deep in the forest.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Yoran said that she did not know how much value her glass house had lost, but that she trusted in her husband's ''sixth sense,'' which had guided them through their lives. Mr. Yoran's eyes still sparkle as he watches his wife of 55 years move among her abstract stone artworks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They do not mind if Mel or Bob or anyone else peeks inside the home that took their whole lives to find.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What I like about this is, the inside out and the outside in,'' said Mrs. Yoran, gesturing toward the glass. ''It's a matter of perspective.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GREENWICH, Conn. -- ''This is one of the wows,'' said Tracy Villanueva, a mother of four, as she opened the doors of a spacious closet in the hallway of her four-bedroom apartment here. ''Look at how big this is. You don't even know this is housing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By housing, Ms. Villanueva, 35, meant public housing. Certainly neither her apartment, with its large, bright windows, nor the grounds of the complex, with a new basketball court and neatly mowed lawns, fit the image of public housing. And public housing might be the last thing that springs to mind when thinking about Greenwich, a suburb known for its reserves of wealth and impeccable mansions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than 50 years, the town has, through its Housing Authority, quietly overseen a growing assortment of low- and moderate-income housing, now scattered across a dozen sites. There are almost 750 units in all, some in buildings within view of multimillion-dollar houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not your typical public housing,'' said Anthony L. Johnson, executive director of the authority, which for the last three years has earned a coveted ''high performer'' designation from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We provide not only a great place to live but also the amenities that come from living in the town of Greenwich: the school system and the services and community involvement,'' he said. ''You have people in public housing who go to school with kids whose parents are hedge fund owners.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenwich being Greenwich, the tenants are somewhat atypical, too. ''We house a lot of people who grew up here and used to be servants on estates,'' said Mr. Johnson, referring to retired caretakers, nannies and laundresses who are now settled in some of the 300 apartments set aside for the elderly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it's not unusual to find public housing in the New York City suburbs, such buildings tend to be in more struggling towns and cities where tenants grapple with the same issues as their big-city counterparts, from drug-dealing to broken elevators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experience of Greenwich, whose Housing Authority was created at the end of World War II, in part to house returning veterans, may hold lessons for Westchester County, whose legislature approved a landmark desegregation agreement this week. That agreement, the result of a lawsuit filed by an antidiscrimination group, requires the county, one of the wealthiest in the nation, to produce hundreds of houses and apartments for moderate-income people in overwhelmingly white communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the agreement, the county would build or acquire 750 homes or apartments, the clear majority of them in towns and villages where black residents make up 3 percent or less of the population and Hispanic residents make up less than 7 percent. The town of Greenwich would barely miss those criteria, with a black population of 1.8 percent and a Hispanic population of 7.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways, the housing in Greenwich mirrors modern trends in public housing -- low-rise, small-scale structures -- even though most of it was built years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Ms. Villanueva's complex, Wilbur Peck Court, one of the larger ones run by the Housing Authority, with 110 units, residents live in one of several three-story buildings arranged in the style of garden apartments. Picnic tables, barbecue equipment, a colorful play set and a new basketball court adorn the well-kept grounds, where smooth boulders emerge from grassy areas that on a recent day were devoid of litter and weeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a bunch of us who really want this place to be good,'' said Lucy Receendiz, a resident of Wilbur Peck for seven years who before that had lived in Armstrong Court, another subsidized building. ''I give it a 10. Look at it. Have you been to places this calm?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the economy has spiraled downward in the past year, demand for the housing here has risen. About 600 names are now on a waiting list for the family housing, double the number from two years ago. In just the last three months, the number of elderly applicants on the list for senior housing has climbed to 162 from 136.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town gives preference to applicants who work or live in Greenwich, but anyone in the country can put their names on the lists. ''Last year we may have turned over 30 to 35 units in our entire portfolio,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''You can wait for years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the buildings are unusually well maintained and clean, public housing in Greenwich is not immune from the sorts of problems that occur elsewhere. In March, for instance, a melee erupted outside Wilbur Peck Court after the police tried to disperse a crowd of teenagers who were drinking. The confrontation quickly escalated, and when it ended, three police officers had been injured and five men arrested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Housing Authority initially moved to evict four tenants because of the incident but wound up settling for the departure of individual young men rather than their entire families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan DuBois, the chairman of the Housing Authority, said that while he thought the housing was well managed, some units were in serious need of replacement or renovation, adding that ''the style and size of the apartments is well below the standards that the community expects.'' A plan to greatly expand and rehabilitate two of the senior housing complexes has run into neighborhood opposition, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any proposed land use in this town is controversial,'' he said. ''It takes a community decision that it's appropriate policy for the town to encourage affordable housing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Villanueva, a single mother, moved with her four children from the Bronx into a small attic apartment in Greenwich a few years ago. At the time, she was a sales assistant for a brokerage firm in Fairfield County and, as she put it, ''came here for all the perks'' -- in particular the public schools, town beach, libraries and agencies like the local Boys and Girls Club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of her children's teachers suggested that she apply for public housing; a year and a half ago, the four-bedroom apartment in Wilbur Peck opened up. Another family in town agreed to help her and her four children -- Alex, 11; Hannah, 6; and Hailey and Amanda, 4-year-old twins. The family has showered the children with furnishings and gifts, including a sleek black chair with built-in stereo speakers for Alex's bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Villanueva lost her job in April, and she said she sometimes feels the sting of alienation that comes from being at the lower end of the economic spectrum in an affluent world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's the double edge,'' she explained. ''You can tell the rich kids from the ones who are not as rich. They don't flaunt it, but they can participate in so much more than we can, like ballet. Hannah wants to do ballet, but I can't afford it. And I can't say that I have people coming over for drinks, whereas I did, of course, in the Bronx.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the Westchester agreement, Craig Gurian, executive director of the Anti-Discrimination Center, the group that filed the lawsuit that produced the agreement, said some residents of the two dozen communities eligible for the housing had also expressed concerns about cultural disparity. On blogs and in interviews, they worried about how newcomers of more modest means would fare socially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gurian said the way to resolve such anxieties was more affordable housing, not less. ''The more diversity of various kinds that exists, the more likely those problems of fitting in will fade,'' he said. ''Social pressures are real. They're real for adults and they're real for children. But doesn't most every family make a series of choices in terms of where they live and balancing issues of cost, schools, jobs, friends and safety?''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ST. SIMONS, a barrier island on the Georgia coast, is in Glynn County, about 95 minutes from Savannah and about the same distance from Jacksonville, Fla. Land-use ordinances, height restrictions and environmental efforts have resulted in a getaway that is popular but not overbuilt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not just a make-believe touristy location,'' said Pat Cooper, the president of and broker at Hodnett-Cooper Real Estate. ''There is an active full-time population here. We have schools.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cooper said that few homes were bought by speculators or investors. ''We see a lot of families, many who have been vacationing here for generations, as well as writers and artists,'' she said. ''We have retirees, but I wouldn't call it a retirement community. And this is not really a place for the spring break crowd.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-lane roads, many unpaved, meander along the water through tunnels of live oaks, Spanish moss and golden grasses near marshlands. Ruined plantations are found along these byways; graveyards too. Local lore is rife with stories of ghosts and hauntings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mallory Street runs through the island and ends at the pier in the slow-paced unincorporated town of St. Simons. There are restaurants, few of which are chains, and shops, most of them local, and frequent live music performances. Still, the main activities are going to the public oceanfront community pool, waterfront park and beach, or fishing from the pier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The population of the island, the largest of the Golden Isles, is slightly less than 14,000. Vacation homes tend to be used by owners rather than be rented out. And there aren't a lot of hotels. Condominiums are a presence, but single-family houses dominate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest clusters of buyers hail from Atlanta, about five hours away, and Florida. Snowbirds come from Michigan, Minnesota and the Northeast; Ms. Cooper said she had recently seen more buyers from California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about 165 properties over $1 million on the market. Only a handful are more than $3 million, and some top out at over $6 million. Condominiums can list for as little as $200,000 if not on the water. Still, the beach is usually no more than five minutes away. Waterfront condominiums start in the mid-$400,000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This 6,000-square-foot house designed by the original owner was built in 1990. The three-story oceanfront home has a private beach and expansive water views from every room. It is within walking distance of the pier and shops in the village of St. Simons. Floor-to-ceiling windows wrap around the front of the house to create curved viewing areas. The open-floor-plan layout has hardwood floors, vaulted ceilings, internal arches and skylights.

This 1,600-square-foot unit has cherry hardwood floors, large windows, a balcony and a gas fireplace. It has views of the Intracoastal Waterway and marsh.

</div><div class="author">By JACK HEALY   </div><div>758 words</div><div>25 September 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell unexpectedly last month, an industry group reported Thursday, showing that a budding recovery in the housing market remained weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A four-month streak of improvements in sales of existing homes gave way to a seasonally adjusted 2.7 percent dip in August, according to the National Association of Realtors, as prospective buyers of condos and single-family homes pulled back in the Northeast, the South and the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said it was too soon to say whether the drop represented a hiccup in the market or a sign of deeper problems for the housing market. Despite the monthly decline, sales in August were still 3.4 percent higher than a year earlier, when the collapse of the housing market was rapidly dragging down the economy. And they marked the second-highest sales figures of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not alarmed by the softening in sales,'' said Celia Chen, a housing economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''The trend is still very strongly up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Portland, Ore., a real estate agent, Melvin Broadous, said he was detecting signs of a thaw, especially at the low end of the market, where homes priced near $200,000 were drawing multiple bids and cash offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market is moving,'' he said. ''I liken it to putting popcorn in a microwave. You're hearing it pop a little more every week.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have been edging higher over the last few months as lower prices, affordable mortgage rates and a tax credit for first-time home buyers have drawn buyers back to open houses. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 5.04 percent last week, down from 6.09 percent a year ago, the mortgage underwriter <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing and real estate groups like the National Association of Realtors have called on Congress to extend or expand the tax credit for first-time buyers, saying that sales could slide back once it expires at the end of November. While the program has helped to drive sales higher this summer, some economists say its effects are waning because most interested buyers have already taken advantage of the $8,000 credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' group estimated that 30 to 40 percent of all buyers were first-time homeowners. In August, median home prices across the country fell by nearly $4,000, to $177,700, and were down 12.5 percent from a year earlier. Inventories of homes for sale fell to a supply that would take 8.5 months to burn through, the lowest levels all year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in sales puzzled economists, in part because pending sales of homes had risen. Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors' group, attributed the slide in August to an especially strong performance a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some of the giveback in closed sales appears to result from rising numbers of contracts entering the system, with some fallouts and a backlog contributing to a longer closing process, but the decline demonstrates we can't take a housing rebound for granted,'' Mr. Yun said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economists said the fluctuations in home sales could reflect rising unemployment across the country. About 15 million people are now out of work and economists expect the unemployment rate to hit 9.8 percent when the government reports its monthly employment figures next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The job market is the biggest thing that's going to keep sales down next year,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight. ''When people can't find a job, they don't move. They can't buy or sell a home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the Labor Department offered a bit of good news about the job market, reporting that first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell by 21,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 530,000. States where jobless claims fell said there had been fewer layoffs in manufacturing, construction and service sector jobs.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   </div><div>1502 words</div><div>21 September 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Monday about the aftermath of Hurricane Ike in the city of Galveston misstated the number of families who received emergency housing assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It was at least 21,800, federal officials said -- not 1,300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Tue Sep 22 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GALVESTON, Tex. -- There are many signs that this seaside town has revived a year after Hurricane Ike flooded more than 17,000 homes and businesses. The big resorts are humming again, and on hot days people throng the newly restored beaches. The port is open, and the cruise ships are back. Most of the businesses on the Strand, the island's historic strip of shops and restaurants, have reopened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the progress has been slow, and officials say it may be several years before the city fully recovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the debris cleared, the main thoroughfares appear now much as they did before the storm, but on the backstreets, thousands of residents -- in particular the poor and elderly who lacked insurance -- are still struggling with the lingering effects of the hurricane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 20 percent of the 58,000 people who lived in the city before the hurricane have not returned, and one-quarter of the families whose homes were damaged by floods -- about 4,000 households -- are still unable to live in them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands of people are still staying with relatives or living in campers and government-provided trailers next to their ruined homes. About 3,000 are staying on the mainland in temporary apartments subsidized by the government. Many of these families are still waiting for more than $160 million in federal housing grants that have been approved but have yet to be disbursed because of bureaucratic delays in Austin, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a lot of people who didn't have insurance or who had some but not enough,'' said Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas. ''It's just not fair. People are waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing aid that has arrived has often proved to be too little. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has distributed emergency housing assistance to 1,300 households, but many residents found that the grants, which were capped at $28,800, did not cover their damages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state and federal governments have yet to take steps to protect the city from a future storm, beyond financing a $46 million project to rebuild six miles of beaches and dunes. But a multibillion-dollar proposal to create a system of dikes coupled with giant, swinging gates across the mouth of Galveston Bay and San Luis Pass has begun to gather political momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEMA has distributed at least $189 million to flood victims in Galveston County for temporary housing or repairs, and the city has received $86 million in aid, mostly for removing debris. An additional $269 million in block grants from the federal Housing and Urban Development Department has been approved for infrastructure and repairs to houses but has not arrived, city officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scars from the hurricane are sprinkled through the town. Four sprawling housing projects that were flooded have been razed. (There is a debate about where to rebuild them.) The system for storm water is still clogged with sand. More than 30,000 dead trees have yet to be removed. And the buildings at the state park are still little more than concrete ruins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttered businesses dot the island, and those still open are taking in only about 65 percent to 70 percent of their former earnings, according to the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many residents say they find reasons to be optimistic. By most accounts, the pace of recovery here has been much better than in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, a more powerful storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After flirting with moving the island's hospital and medical school to the mainland, the State Legislature voted at the end of the summer to spend $667 million to rebuild it, ensuring that the town's largest employer would stay put.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the traditional tourist destinations have reopened; the beaches have been restored by the state at a cost of $12 million. The city itself has avoided widespread layoffs, even though property taxes have plummeted, by spending money from a reserve fund, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while at least 180 businesses have shut down for good, more than 130 new ones have opened, chamber officials say. Developers have also been snapping up properties near the water at a rapid rate, pouncing on depressed prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a no-brainer,'' said Peter Koke, a North Carolina developer who has bought a dozen houses in Galveston County since the storm. ''It's going to come back way stronger than it was.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anyone embodies this seaside town's determination to rebuild after Hurricane Ike, it is Jack King, the white-haired candy maker whose downtown store was a fixture on the island for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, when Mr. King arrived at his confectionery, the floodwaters had swept through the cavernous parlor and destroyed everything: the antique counters and cabinets, the hardwood floor, the soda fountains, the gleaming counter from Italy and most of the candy-making machinery, including the saltwater taffy pullers that had made the shop famous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he is 72, Mr. King said he never thought once about retiring. He plundered his savings and fought with his insurance company to get the $500,000 he needed to rebuild. La King's Confectionery reopened in late July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I been in the candy business all my life,'' he said. ''I don't know how to do anything else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kim Bachmeier and her husband, Steve Whitcher, decided to cash in their retirement funds and open a shoe store for runners, Fit to Run, near the Strand. Ms. Bachmeier said she hoped the store would not only provide them an income but would also inspire more people to take up exercise to beat their post-hurricane blues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After the hurricane, a lot of people found the bottom of a lot of bottles; that was their way to deal with things,'' Ms. Bachmeier said. ''It's more than just a store to us; it's the beginning of a positive change for the island.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone shares Ms. Bachmeier's sanguine outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every day, Brenda Roby tiptoes through the rubble of her house on an inlet to get the mail from her box, one of the few things the storm did not carry away. The storm not only wiped her two-story house off its foundation, but it destroyed a building housing her catering business, as well. She has collected her flood insurance, about $120,000, but it is not enough to rebuild, and the state-financed windstorm insurance company has denied her claim. She has lived in limbo for months in a FEMA trailer on her property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've never been homeless or jobless in my life until after Ike,'' she said. ''Everybody is talking about how everybody got back on their feet, and I said, 'O.K., I can't do anything yet. One year later and I'm right where I was before.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a grand divide exists between those like Ms. Roby who were insured against floods and those who were not. About 17,000 homes were seriously damaged, and 5,200 of the families in them did not have flood insurance. Most of the homeowners were poor or elderly, said Joe Higgs of Gulf Coast Interfaith, a group helping hurricane victims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The people who haven't recovered are really the most vulnerable,'' he said. ''They are low income, and because of that they often did not have insurance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many poor residents said the $28,800 grants they had received from FEMA were insufficient to finish repairs on their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The floodwaters nearly drowned William and Dorothy Auzston in their home on the night of Sept. 13 last year. Both are retired and in poor health, living on Social Security. They had no insurance; the home that Mr. Auzston, 83, built decades ago was in a flood zone, and a policy would be prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the storm, the Auzstons have spent the FEMA grant to clear the rubble andbuy a camper to live in. They also managed to buy blueprints and have pilings driven, on top of which they hope to rebuild their home. But they are out of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You are not going to rebuild no house with any $28,000,'' said Ms. Auzston, 60, a former hospital orderly who suffers from diabetes and breast cancer. ''I have cried and cried and cried. It's just not worth it anymore.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OVER the last decade, the image of Harlem as a place of vacant brownstones and broken-down rooming houses has faded, as many buildings have been turned into apartments and single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now Stanley McIntosh and his wife, Rosalinda Cooper, who live in the restored brownstone on West 132nd Street that he grew up in, are worried that the old days might be returning: A developer, caught short by the plunging real estate market, is converting a nearby 18-foot-wide brick row house back into a rooming house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McIntosh, the president of the Neighbors United of West 132nd Street Block Association, has begun a campaign against the rooming house. The developer, Gerald Migdol, said that the rooming house was legal, and would provide needed housing ''for the working poor and working lower-middle-class people who couldn't afford a market-rate one- or two-bedroom.'' He confirmed that the Department of Buildings was reviewing the permit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans for the house, at 228 West 132nd Street near Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, show eight single-room-occupancy units, each one about 150 square feet, with bathrooms but not kitchens, on the second and third floors. A ninth single room will be in the basement, along with a two-bedroom apartment. The parlor floor will house a two-bedroom apartment and a communal kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan for the rooming house began in adversity. Mr. Migdol, a longtime Harlem developer, had bought up five town houses on the block, renovating and selling them to families. He sold one house in 2005 for $1.5 million, but in July of this year he sold another for only $1.05 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He paid $875,000 for No. 228 in 2005 and filed plans to convert it to a two-family house, but soon realized the numbers didn't work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighbors became alarmed when they noticed 16 toilets being delivered to the house, and alerted city officials. The work was stopped, but not before neighbors noticed a new partition in the middle of a large arched window on the parlor floor facing the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Mr. Migdol filed new plans showing the rooming house units. He says that the city no longer permits residential property owners to create rooming houses, but that they can restore rooming-house units previously on the property. The window partition has been removed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Section 8 rent subsidies could make the rooming house very profitable. City officials say the government pays monthly subsidies of up to $930 for each small unit, and $1,500 for each two-bedroom apartment, for a potential rent roll of more than $11,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Migdol said he hoped to rent to veterans and the elderly. But city officials note that the homeless, people displaced from their homes and victims of domestic violence get preference for the vouchers. The property awaits a certificate of occupancy, Mr. Migdol said, though building records show a stop-work order on it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SINCE the bankruptcy of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> a year ago, the developer Aby Rosen has repeatedly cut the asking price on a newly renovated town house at 3 East 94th Street, by nearly 20 percent, to $23.75 million from $29.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its 50-foot indoor pool, whirlpool bath, sauna, 1,000-bottle temperature-controlled wine cellar and seven wood-burning fireplaces, it seemed perfect for a newly minted baron of finance, but the species was suddenly in short supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, late last month, just before the start of the fall selling season and the promise of a new wave of Wall Street bonuses, the town house's price was bumped up by $1 million to $24.75 million. The jump is part of a boomlet of optimism that is rippling through the luxury real estate market, after a forgettable year of decline and gloom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosen is one of a number of sellers of expensive properties who, contrary to conventional wisdom, have begun to toy with higher asking prices, despite declining prices elsewhere in the marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the summer, Michael Lemos, the heir to a Greek shipping fortune, raised the asking price on his fifth-floor 14-room full-floor co-op at 2 East 67th Street and Fifth Avenue to $45 million, in what may be a game of one-upmanship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lemos first listed the apartment for a mere $33.9 million in April 2008. But he raised his asking price a few months later to $39.5 million, after Jonathan Tisch, the chairman of Loews Hotels, bought an apartment on the 11th floor of the co-op for $48 million, setting a record at the time for the highest priced co-op.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, last June, Athanase Lavidas, the head of a Greek pharmaceutical company, listed his third-floor apartment in the building for $43 million, and Mr. Lemos responded by tacking another $5.5 million onto his asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The seller feels that $45 million is appropriate,'' said Dolly Lenz, the broker for Mr. Lemos's co-op. But she noted that Mr. Lemos's fifth-floor apartment, unlike its third-floor competitor, is ''at the treetop level or above,'' and that like Mr. Tisch's apartment, it has large picture windows facing Central Park that could no longer be installed because of landmark rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 502 Park Avenue, Sheikh Abdul Aziz al-Thani of Qatar listed his fourth-floor apartment last year for $14 million and then cut it to $10 million in February in the gloomy market. At the end of July, he raised the price back up to $14 million. Carrie Chiang of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, who is listing the property, did not return several telephone calls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about Mr. Rosen's price increase, one broker said it had begun as a typographical error. But Kirk Henckels, the director of private brokerage at Stribling, who has the listing, said that the increase had been prompted in part by a recent deal close to the previous $23.75 million asking price that fell through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are headed toward what could be a healthy market,'' Mr. Henckels said, ''but we are not there yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, action speaks louder than asking prices. A few weeks ago, a contract was signed for a 3,500-square-foot apartment on the 70th floor of 25 Columbus Circle, represented by Denise Rosner of Halstead Property. The asking price was $15.7 million, and per square foot, the unit was priced below some smaller lower-floor apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The price that we were asking was backed up by data,'' she said. ''If you price it right, they will come.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE first anniversary last week of the <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapse was a grim milestone. During the financial meltdown that followed, markets across the globe were roiled. New York real estate did not escape unscathed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity was basically frozen through the winter, and the customarily busy spring season was slow. In the summer, when the market usually becomes sluggish, contract signings finally picked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That left everyone wondering what to expect from the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, there is a modest bump in the number of apartments listed for sale the week after Labor Day. But professional and amateur market watchers worried: What would it mean if this year was different? Would an avalanche of new listings be the equivalent of a last-ditch effort from sellers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If few were added, would it mean owners had no confidence that they could sell anything?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the market appears to be behaving much more normally this fall than it did over the last 12 tumultuous months. A comparison of data from two of the city's largest real estate brokerages and two Web sites that follow the industry shows that the number of listings added in Manhattan after Labor Day was similar to last year's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Seasonally, this is the expectation,'' said Jonathan Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. Because the listing level is considered normal, he said, ''we see it as a sign of confidence, that consumers are willing to see this as a market they can sell their property in.'' Although he said it made sense to be happy for the good news, it didn't mean that the boom times had returned, only that the steep decline had abated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It shows we're going in a better direction,'' Mr. Miller said. ''I think that direction is sideways as opposed to through the floor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stabilizing of inventory does not mean that sellers will be getting the prices they received a year or two ago. New data from StreetEasy.com suggests that asking prices are about 24 percent below levels last year at this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both NYTimes.com and StreetEasy had more than 450 new listings in Manhattan the week after Labor Day. StreetEasy said the increase of 462 apartment listings was similar to the jump last year after Labor Day of 472.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Miller, inventory for August of this year -- which clocked in at 8,423 co-ops, condos and town houses -- was only 2.8 percent higher than for the same month last year. But the ride from August to August was a roller coaster. Inventory started to pile up last fall, and when it peaked in March, there were more than 11,000 units on the market -- 34.7 percent more listings than in August of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The second quarter was very bleak,'' said Sofia Kim, the vice president for research at StreetEasy. ''Nothing was moving.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The three things we're watching for are prices dropping, transaction activity and inventory,'' Ms. Kim said. ''What we saw this summer was transactions going up; inventory looks like it's stabilizing; the only thing of concern right now is prices are still dropping.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 40 percent of the new listings in Manhattan after Labor Day were condos and 60 percent were co-ops, according to StreetEasy. One-bedrooms had the largest inventory increase, at 171 new listings, followed closely by two-bedrooms, at 160. There were 65 newly listed studios on the market and 50 three-bedroom apartments. Homes with more than three bedrooms saw the smallest bump, with only 16 new listings the week after Labor Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking prices, meanwhile, were way down from previous years, according to StreetEasy. The median asking price for the week that ended on Sept. 13 was $860,750. The week after Labor Day 2008, the comparable figure was $1,100,000. After Labor Day 2007, it was $1,050,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The week after Labor Day in 2007, studio apartments new to the market were listed at a median price of $525,000. The next year, the median price was $429,000. This year, it was down to $399,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over that same period, new one-bedrooms went from $785,000 to $775,000, and are now down to $675,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-bedrooms went from $1,412,500 in 2007, up to $1,599,500 in 2008 and then down to $1,250,000 this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither NYTimes.com nor StreetEasy could provide year-over-year data for the boroughs outside Manhattan on prices, inventory or the number of new listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ramon and Carly Alvarez staged their first open house last Sunday for the two-bedroom Upper West Side co-op they have just put on the market. Even though they moved to New Jersey in early August, they decided not to list their apartment until after Labor Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is that fear of it getting stale, knowing half the buyers were going to be out of town,'' Mr. Alvarez said. ''When the same apartment's been sitting there for a long time, you're like, 'Well, what's wrong with it?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alvarezes' agent, Andrea D'Amico, a vice president at Corcoran, advised them to hold off on the listing until after the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you list this at the beginning of August, when everyone's away on vacation,'' Ms. D'Amico said, ''then it will sit here with no traffic and suddenly people walk in after Labor Day and it's been on for a month. Then people think, 'It's really time to negotiate.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A search of Corcoran's database, including exclusive and nonexclusive listings, showed that the Alvarezes had lots of company on the sidelines during the summer. It found 426 new listings for the week ended Sept. 13. That same search showed 518 new listings the week after Labor Day in 2008 and 563 new listings the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the last year, many people held their apartments off the market,'' said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. ''I think it's a good sign that we're getting a normal number of apartments on after Labor Day.'' Sellers, she added, have become used to the idea of lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mary Stone and her husband, Channing Creecy, first put their one-bedroom Upper East Side co-op on the market in March, they were testing the waters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were good options to buy a house or to upgrade,'' Ms. Stone said, ''but there wasn't an urgency to it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Ms. Stone is pregnant. She and her husband have decided that it's time to move to the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the spring, their apartment was listed for $649,000. They took it off the market at the end of July. Using an apartment that recently sold in their building as a guide, they just relisted it, this time for $575,000, with Patty Lehan of Prudential Douglas Elliman's Shemesh Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't know exactly what the right price was,'' Ms. Stone said of the earlier figure. ''Now we have more clarity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past years, apartment prices in Manhattan were practically dictated by buyers with huge Wall Street bonuses. But that era is over, at least for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With bonuses, the general consensus is that it's never going to be what we had,'' said Dottie Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''But it was mad money. It was unreal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Ms. Herman, Prudential experienced a spike of nearly 35 percent the week before Labor Day this year over last. But the next week, listings were down about 30 percent from 2008's numbers. So, she says, things are about the same as last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To be really healthy,'' Ms. Herman said, ''you don't want to be at either extreme. You don't want to be in the market we were in a few years back when there was no inventory, but you also don't want to be at the opposite of that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good job market is essential to a healthy real estate business. After dipping slightly in July, the national unemployment rate inched close to 10 percent in August, hitting a high of 9.7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Movements in the job world, along with events like marriage, divorce, birth and death, also dictate what happens in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheri Whitko Desai, a photographer, and her husband, Anar Desai, who works in technology sales, are moving to Chicago for work. Their Brooklyn Heights apartment is on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their real estate agent, Jon Varnedoe, an associate broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, held the first open house last weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a special place to us,'' Ms. Whitko Desai said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one-bedroom was the first home either of them had ever owned, and Mr. Desai proposed to her on the balcony the day they closed on the apartment three years ago. They paid $530,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're cautiously optimistic,'' Mr. Desai said. ''Everyone knows what's been going on this year in terms of the economy, but it looks like people are getting back in. And people are beginning to look at real estate differently,'' he added. ''It's where you're putting your savings and your nest egg, not necessarily something you'll get a quick hit off of.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment is listed for $575,000, and Mr. Desai says his hope is to break about even after fees and taxes, rather than make a killing .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In many ways, it's going to be a healthier market,'' said Hall Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens. ''It will be more affordable to more people, which is more sustainable. A lot of money was made during the boom years,'' he said, ''but I don't know if it's such a great world when people with good jobs and a good income can't buy a home. I don't think we're going back there for a while.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW CANAAN, the swank little bedroom community that had a major fling with SUVs and McMansions in the go-go years, looks to be downsizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Priuses have become the new car to have,'' said Jeb Walker, the town's first selectman. And the market for supersize homes has all but evaporated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''McMansions? The market for $4 million to $6 million houses is very quiet,'' said Jill K. Wippern, a broker at Brotherhood and Higley Real Estate. ''We have a number of them sitting empty, and as far as I know, there are very few builders that are planning to build big spec homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While expressing optimism going into the fall, Prudence Parris, a veteran agent in New Canaan, said selling prices at the high end had fallen 28 percent over the last year. As for the decade-old trend of shoe-horning giant mansions into small downtown lots, ''we are on the verge of another change,'' she said. ''The nouveaux riches, the young people who are making enough to buy houses, may now want smaller houses'' -- which here means just four bedrooms and three baths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nestled in the crook of Connecticut's southwest corner 45 miles from Manhattan, New Canaan has never been a bargain hunter's paradise. Town employees have struggled for decades to find affordable housing, and when Wall Street's readjustments rippled out last year, it was suddenly all right to express nostalgia for a time when Hummers and $2 million homes weren't the norm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I found New Canaan, I just couldn't believe the uniqueness of this place,'' said Jack Trifero, 58, who moved here in the mid 1970s. The red-brick storefronts along Main and Elm Streets ''reminded me a bit of Europe,'' he said. ''It was definitely a community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trifero said he had also been delighted to discover a cache of nearly 100 midcentury modern houses built in the '50s by architects like Marcel Breuer and Philip Johnson, who at one point kept his office in the Ferrara Building, at 88 Main.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the '60s, the town was known as a pioneer of the four-acre single-family property zone, slapped on top of a two-acre zone. Big lots -- McProperties, you could call them -- enabled old money and avant-garde architecture to coexist. It's hard to throw rocks at glass houses, after all, when they can't be seen from the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Canaan was also known as a haven for book editors and writers, advertising executives and transient corporate families (''I'm with I.B.M.: I've Been Moved''). ''Next station to heaven,'' it was called, but with an edge. Along with good schools and abundant tennis courts, there were more than a dozen liquor stores. Ang Lee's 1997 film ''The Ice Storm'' captured the ennui of the town's teenagers circa 1973.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Disclosure: I grew up in New Canaan, and my mother still lives there.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently the ''Mad Men'' culture gave way to financial-sector families. In 2007, the population was about 19,400, the median household income $178,650, and the median home sale price $1.685 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there are fewer liquor stores, not everyone is unwinding with yoga. ''Any type of drug available in any community is present in New Canaan,'' Leon Krolikowski, the police captain, said, ''with alcohol still being the most commonly abused substance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McMansions notwithstanding, New Canaan remains ''very quaint,'' said Robert Wyatt, 55, who moved here with his family two and a half years ago and lives within earshot of the commuter train's hourly bleats as it lumbers in. ''Everybody knows you, and the schools are excellent,'' he said. Indicating a church youth group that does volunteer work, he said, ''Of course, it's a very wealthy community, but families really give to that effort and participate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents also help to sustain the Waveny Care Network, which has an assisted-living residence and a care center for Alzheimer's patients, with its own evocative indoor version of Elm Street. There's also Staying Put in New Canaan, a membership group that helps elderly residents live on their own, and Silver Hill Hospital, a mental health and addiction treatment center known for its rich and famous patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children are expected to conform and perform. ''It's a nice place to live,'' said Dawson Allen, 18, a recent high school graduate. But ''one downside is the focus on scores and academics. When you step outside that box, it gets iffy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this Fairfield County suburb, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats 3,242 to 1,322; 93 percent of residents are white, according to a 2007 survey by the Connecticut Economic Resource Center. Stay-at-home spouses with children in tow are so common they help keep Rosie's, a cafe and carry-out on Elm, in business. ''They don't work; they work out,'' George Nammack, an owner, said fondly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 22-square-mile town has concentric circles of one-third-, one-half-, one- and two-acre lots, capped by a swath of homes on four acres or more. About 1,200 apartments and condominiums mingle with roughly 6,000 single-family homes. Standing out from the conventional crowd downtown is a brand-new ultracontemporary house at 173 Park Street, which recently went on the market for $4.95 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boutiques and chain stores line downtown streets east of the Victorian train station. Town planners are contemplating a zoning change that would invite larger businesses and medical practices to move into an area southwest of the station. Opponents of the change, including Mr. Trifero, who owns a video store on Main Street, maintain that it would dilute the village atmosphere and hurt shops like his. ''It's a delicate biosphere,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about 265 houses on the market this fall, with asking prices starting at $350,000. Although overall prices are down ''at least 20 percent'' since 2006, says Jaime Sneddon, a broker at William Raveis Real Estate, and although a third of the sales he handled in the first six months of 2009 went for less than $1 million, the average is still $1.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents are listing about 70 condos, priced at $300,000 to $2.3 million. Ms. Parris, who works for William Pitt Sotheby's International, noted that the sluggish market had made more houses and condos available for rent, with nearly 100 listed at prices ranging up to $25,000 a month. The Avalon complex, about a mile from the train station, has one- to three-bedroom apartments, starting at $2,199 a month. Units in the Ferrara Building downtown rent for $1,950.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rush-hour train to Grand Central Terminal takes 65 minutes; at other times, the trip takes an additional 5 to 10 minutes and requires changing in Stamford. Some commuters drive; the town is just off the Merritt Parkway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rich assortment of public spaces includes ''God's Acre,'' a patch of green rimmed by graceful old homes and churches; Waveny Park, a 300-acre former estate with vast fields and a new swimming pool; Mead Park, with a pond and playing fields downtown; and the Nature Center, with 40 acres of well-tended paths and buildings on Oenoke Ridge. The town runs a youth center, a senior center, a well-endowed public library and a human services department with a staff of six.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the private Silvermine Guild Arts Center, which offers classes and workshops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Day trippers are drawn by the town's pastoral back roads, antiques and clothing shops, lush parks and sophisticated restaurants. Mr. Trifero offers informal driving tours of the Modernist housing stock (modernhouseman.com). Tours of the Philip Johnson Glass House requirereservations (philipjohnsonglasshouse.org). Overnighters with means book at the Roger Sherman Inn and restaurant, opposite the Nature Center and about a 15-minute walk to New Canaan's downtown (rogershermaninn.com).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the last 15 years or so,'' Mr. Walker, the first selectman, said, ''the No. 1 attraction for people who have come to this town would be the school system. We have probably the best school system in the state of Connecticut, certainly one of the best in the entire New York metropolitan region.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are five public schools. Among fourth-graders in 2008, 88.3 percent showed proficiency in reading, 89.6 percent in writing and 88.7 percent in math, versus 55.9, 62.9 and 60.3 percent statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high school led the state on the SAT's last year. Averages were 599 for math, 581 for reading and 593 for writing, versus 504, 502 and 503 statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Established as Canaan Parish in 1731, the town switched from farming to manufacturing and became known in the early 19th century for its shoemakers. It was incorporated in 1801; 67 years later trains arrived, changing everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: IN PLAY: New Canaan could rezone for larger businesses in a part of its downtown; one shop owner who opposes that idea described the downtown, shown here on Elm Street, as a ''delicate biosphere.''

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE actress Tuesday Weld, whose beachfront house in Montauk has been on and off the market for five years, recently lowered the asking price to $7.75 million from $10 million, hoping to attract ''new interest,'' according to her agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has seen a lot of action'' by the star-struck and the curious, said the agent, Theresa Eurell of Town &amp; Country Real Estate. She now hopes that buyers, not gawkers, will consider the 1.41-acre property, which sits on a bluff and has a pool house, a two-car garage and a greenhouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Eurell's hopes may bear fruit this time; she says she has serious offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many of her earnest lookers have also been checking out a nearby property with a more notorious recent past: Bernard L. Madoff's $8.75 million 3,000-square-foot oceanfront home was listed on Sept. 1 under the watch of the United States Marshals Service. Federal authorities seized the house after Mr. Madoff was imprisoned for running a giant Ponzi scheme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Wednesday it went into contract -- reportedly for more than the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard V. Guardino Jr., the executive dean of the Wilbur F. Breslin Center for Real Estate Studies at Hofstra University, noted that homes owned by the celebrated or the notorious initially ''generate more traffic'' because of curiosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At the end of the day,'' he added, buyers ''will look at the value they are getting, look at the amenities that they want and make the decision based on that.'' He cited Victoria Gotti's Old Westbury mansion, which failed to sell over the last five years despite its owner's role in a reality TV series and price cuts to $2.9 million from $4.9 million. It went into foreclosure in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, the football star Vinny Testaverde's lavish 16-room Oyster Bay Cove mansion on four acres has been on the market for nearly two years. Despite its provenance, and a price cut to $3.995 million from $6.995 million, no buyer has stepped forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing is now at the stage where ''we don't really disclose whose house it is when they come and look at it,'' said Elaine Lovaglio, a broker with Lynda Baker Realty in Hicksville, one of four brokers sharing the listing. ''That is not the selling point.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Ms. Lovaglio likes to point out the huge kitchen; the master bedroom with a Juliet balcony overlooking the backyard's two pools, connected by a 20-foot waterfall; the eye-popping chandelier in the foyer; a media room with a granite bar; and a dual fireplace between the library and the family room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The perk of buying a celebrity home, Mr. Guardino said, may be ''cocktail party chatter,'' but it's the home itself that will determine the actual selling price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor do historical pedigrees bolster value. Last December, a 20,000-square-foot Kings Point mansion that once belonged to William R. Grace, a 19th-century mayor of New York City, sold for $4.5 million -- half the early asking price of $9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The historical connection attracted people, ''but it didn't affect people's decision to buy,'' said Joseph Sanders, the manager of Coldwell Banker Residential Broker in Great Neck, which represented the mansion. ''It's all about the price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year Susan Breitenbach, an associate broker with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, listed Tower Hill, the 12-bedroom compound that the former model Christie Brinkley owns in Bridgehampton. ''You do get attention,'' said Ms. Breitenbach, of the $30 million listing. Her client's boldface name ''definitely helps a little bit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buzz ramped up in August, when a former husband of Ms. Brinkley, the singer Billy Joel, listed two properties in Sagaponack: a two-story farmhouse for $22.5 million and, next door, a 1950s bungalow for $12.5 million, each with about 145 feet of oceanfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sale depends on an individual buyer's ''fascination or the intrigue involved,'' said Biana Stepanian, a broker with Corcoran, who listed Mr. Joel's properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you are dealing with real estate of this world-class appeal,'' she said, ''it has to do with where it is and what it is. You have a residence as opposed to a piece of Billy Joel memorabilia.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margaret Trautmann, the associate director of Daniel Gale <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>'s Locust Valley office, said her office used to represent another Billy Joel property: a 14,000-square-foot Centre Island mansion, which has been on and off the market for the last three years, recently at $32.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It can be more of a curse than a blessing'' to have a star listing, Ms. Trautmann said. People are curious to see how a person might live, but ''they don't really want to buy it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the Madoff property, its location was ultimately its selling point, according to Ray Hegner, a Corcoran agent. ''It wasn't for the notoriety,'' he said. ''It sold for the location: one of a kind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ms. Eurell's view, the Weld house, with 4,000 square feet, is a ''better buy'' than the Madoff place, less exposed to beachgoers and with ''far better'' ocean views. ''It is a matter of style, how much work you want to do and how much land you want,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But according to Mr. Hegner, ''for anybody that knows this area,'' the Madoff listing represents ''a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get a house that sits on the beach.'' The house is on the dunes, ''150 feet closer than you could dream of doing today,'' he said, because of changes in federal zoning laws. With laminate countertops and few closets but a ''priceless'' location, ''it is not fancy, but it is the ultimate beach house.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout the history of American commercial life, one cultural trait has tended to dominate: Americans are optimists, a people prone to seeing the glass as not merely half-full but rapidly expanding, and bearing liquid that might yet be turned into gold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This exuberant optimism has proven beneficial, emboldening risk-taking that has achieved innovation and wealth. It has prompted entrepreneurs to invest borrowed money in untested ideas that sometimes yield breakthroughs. It has encouraged ordinary people to accept debt in the name of accelerated gain -- more comfortable homes, higher education, late-model cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in recent times this eagerness to augment the present by borrowing against a seemingly lucrative future has reached dangerous levels. Excessive optimism and its close relation -- a reckless disregard of risk -- are widely blamed for helping carry the United States into the worst financial panic since the Great Depression. Millions bought homes they could not afford, convinced that something good would happen before the bill came due. Financial institutions bet trillions in borrowed funds while leaving little in reserve, soothed by the collective assumption that real estate prices could never fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, as President Obama stood near the New York Stock exchange to champion new regulations for the financial system, admonishing bankers not to ''go back to the days of reckless behavior,'' he effectively challenged a deep-seated notion of the American identity: that Americans are resilient enough to operate free of bureaucratic intrusion and niggling rules, unlike Europeans and their supposed Nanny State.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It goes all the way back to George Washington,'' said Robert Shiller, the Yale economist who warned of the Internet and real estate bubbles, and whose book, ''Irrational Exuberance,'' remains a seminal text on Americans' tendency to believe in good times. ''Washington said regulation should be done with a light hand. The word capitalism hadn't been invented yet, but freedom had. Washington said businesses should be free. There's this hatred of kings that we really have in our blood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a country inclined to celebrate its frontier roots and rugged individualism, how much shock is required before Americans opt to increase the powers of the sheriff? Fear does have a way of inducing change. Eight years ago, when terrorists slammed jets into the World Trade Center, the trauma was so powerful that it appeared to alter cultural norms. Without the spectacle of ordinary people plunging to their deaths, it seems difficult to imagine the United States wiretapping citizens without warrants and waterboarding people in the interest of national security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first months of the contemporary financial disaster -- as fear descended on financial markets and economists worried about a repeat of the Depression -- some assumed that the United States was suffering the financial equivalent of 9/11. Life savings were sliced in half, millions of workers lost their jobs, and homeowners confronted foreclosure. Years of anticipating better days gave way to economic anxiety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some quarters, the sense took hold that household wealth had been looted by Wall Street while the regulators sat mute. Financial institutions had been allowed to operate a casino, using mortgage-backed securities and derivatives as chips, collecting the profits while sticking the taxpayer with the eventual losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely, it seemed, pain and populist anger had altered the balance between trust in the market and the desirability of oversight. Even Alan Greenspan, the long-time Federal Reserve chairman and apostle for laissez-faire, confessed that his faith had been shaken; at one point he suggested that the government might need to nationalize major banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History, too, seemed to indicate that change was on the way. After the Panic of 1873 -- which saw a run of bank failures, the shutdown of the New York Stock Exchange and soaring unemployment -- labor unrest lasted for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three decades later, the Panic of 1907 saw prominent American lenders collapse, leading eventually to the creation of the Federal Reserve, a central bank to watch over all others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Traditionally, the idea of a central bank had been repulsive,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist and co-author of an international survey of financial crises, ''This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Great Depression so tormented Americans that it delivered the New Deal, a muscular collection of government programs whose hallmarks -- unemployment insurance and Social Security -- remain the primary components of the modern-day social safety net. The banking crises of the 1930s prompted the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, which divided investment banks from deposit-taking banks to prevent rampant speculation with ordinary people's savings, while instituting government guarantees on deposits. (Many economists believe the final repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999 played a key role in the reckless investment that triggered the latest crisis.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Memories of trauma can last a long time. Nearly a century has passed since Germany suffered the hyperinflation that helped set the stage for Hitler; yet even today, fear of rising prices remains the primary force in contemporary German policy. Earlier this year, governments from Washington to Beijing unleashed government spending to spur economic activity. Not Germany, ever vigilant against triggering an upward spiral of prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shock that accompanied the end of the American real estate boom once seemed a sentinel event that would bring tighter government scrutiny of the financial realm. Yet as fear of catastrophe fades, the question is how quickly the momentum in Washington for tighter financial rules is diminishing and whether unemployed workers and strapped homeowners will feed a groundswell for change strong enough to offset government turf wars and the influence of financial industry lobbyists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, on Wall Street and on Main Street, many are aware that the era of lightly supervised markets was fabulously lucrative for those positioned to capture a piece. Financial services and real estate -- nurtured by easy money -- swelled into major sources of employment, while boosting stock portfolios for huge institutions and ordinary people alike. New York cemented itself as the global financial capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last quarter-century, moreover, the traditional faith in unfettered markets deepened, and became entwined with the belief in the abundance of American opportunity, reinforcing a justification for laissez-faire: In a land that subscribes to the Horatio Alger story -- in which anyone can supposedly make it -- the market can be trusted to make the rules. For Milton Friedman, the most influential economic thinker of the last half-century, political and economic freedom were synonymous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of complex emotions at work,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''Certainly, we're terrified of the crisis. On the other hand, the United States has been a big winner in the global financial arena, and why change the rules when you're winning?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such sentiments carried the day a decade ago, after the near-collapse of the giant hedge fund <span class="companylink">Long Term Capital Management</span>, which had attracted billions of dollars with the story that its sophisticated computer models had tamed risk. Its failure held the potentialto drag down many of its trading partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, as now, some warned that the near-disaster was a harbinger of worse ahead, if reforms were not put in place that limited how much borrowed money could be employed. But Mr. Greenspan, joined by the Clinton administration Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers, scotched proposals for new rules, arguing that they would stifle American strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the mere consideration of regulations for derivatives ran the risk of prompting investors to take their money overseas ''because of a perception that the American regulatory environment is inhospitable,'' warned Mr. Summers, who is now a leading economic adviser to President Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan delivered the overarching argument for an economy built on optimism, not worry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can have huge amounts of regulation and I will guarantee nothing will go wrong,'' Mr. Greenspan told Congress, ''but nothing will go right either.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Summers, for his part, now likens the impact of the recent crisis to that of the Cuban missile crisis in generating demands for arms control. ''The events of the past two years have raised grave concerns about the soundness of public policy as it regards the financial system,'' he said on Friday, in a speech at Georgetown University McDonough School of Business. ''It is critical to move rapidly while the events of the last two years are clearly in mind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the question now is how many people have similarly changed their sense of what the American economy needs. Mostly, it is a matter of whether the country is still feeling lucky; whether the recent crisis will come to feel like an unavoidable toll on the highway to fortune, or whether something deeper has shifted in the American psyche, leaving us shaken in a lasting way.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dates are subject to change. Times are Eastern and Pacific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEPTEMBER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM On ''Seinfeld'' they always held to the hard-comedy formula: no messages, no hugging. They might have added ''no reunions.'' But Larry David, who co-created that classic sitcom, had an idea for the latest season of his solo series: a fake reunion. And the whole cast agreed. He even got most of the sets back. Who can resist one more Kramer entrance? HBO, Sept. 20 at 10 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOLY GRAIL IN AMERICA In the 19th century a Minnesota farmer dug up a large stone covered in runes --apparently from the 14th century. Once thought to be a hoax, what has become known as the Kensington Runestone now has some believing that the Knights Templar were in America 100 years before Columbus. Judge for yourself. History, Sept. 20 at 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BORED TO DEATHJason Schwartzman (''The Darjeeling Limited'') plays a blocked writer with a drinking problem who pretends to be a detective from his favorite novels. His boss, played by Ted Danson, leads a wild, drug-addled life. HBO, Sept. 20 at 10:30 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ACCIDENTALLY ON PURPOSE Jenna Elfman plays a woman in her late thirties whose one-night romp with a younger man turns into a lifestyle change. She has a baby and he agrees to stick around as the dad -- as long as he can still live with his slacker friends. It sounds like a rip-off of ''Knocked Up,'' but it's really based on a true -- though perhaps not funny -- story. CBS, Sept. 21 at 8:30 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRICK CITY A five-part look at the efforts by Newark Mayor Cory Booker to rebuild his city. Sundance, Sept. 21 at 10 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NCIS: LOS ANGELES This year's inevitable spinoff. After the surging success of the original, a new NCIS team arrives in Los Angeles to solve cases involving the military that are otherwise not unlike the cases solved on any of the three ''C.S.I.'' shows on the same network. Chris O'Donnell (formerly Batman's Robin) and LL Cool J (''The Deal'') play the leads. CBS, Sept. 22 at 9 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE FORGOTTEN The latest -- and maybe most morbid -- iteration of crime units on TV, this one concerns a volunteer group that re-examines unidentified human remains and helps families confirm that their lost loved ones are dead. Then the group hunts down the killers. Christian Slater, who appeared in last year's failed ''My Own Worst Enemy,'' tries again as the lead. ABC, Sept. 22 at 10 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE GOOD WIFE What if all those humiliated political wives had a fictional counterpart who could strike back with a bold new life? That was surely the starting point for this comeback vehicle for Julianna Margulies (''ER''), who plays the middle-age wife of a ne'er-do-well politico who goes to jail, forcing her to become a lawyer again to support the family. A near-perfect vehicle for both Ms. Margulies and CBS, which has a base audience of women about her age, it's a likely hit. CBS, Sept. 22 at 10 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERCY ''Grey's Anatomy'' but with nurses, featuring more soapy swims through the sex-drenched halls of a hospital. The show's strongest calling card is Taylor Schilling, the lead, who plays a nurse just back from a tour in Iraq. Michelle Trachtenberg (''Gossip Girl'') is another nurse. NBC, Sept. 23 at 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MODERN FAMILY Every season (well, not quite every season) has a standout new show. This is it. A truly funny take on an extended family with disparate parts, this comedy does nothing spectacular except be funny. The cast includes Ed O'Neill (''Married With Children'') and Julie Bowen (''Ed''). ABC, Sept. 23 at 9 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COUGAR TOWN Courteney Cox is an ''older woman'' with a teenage son and can't find men her age to date, so it's cougar time in this comedy. ABC, Sept. 23 at 9:30 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EASTWICK The John Updike book-turned-movie is now a TV series. Three women from an old New England town (though the town sign says founded in 1603, which would place it a few years before Jamestown -- truly supernatural) discover their secret powers when they encounter a powerful presence named Darryl Van Horne (get it?). He's played by Paul Gross (''Due South''). Rebecca Romijn (''Ugly Betty'') is one of the witches. ABC, Sept. 23 at 10 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FLASHFORWARD If you are getting nervous about missing your fix of mind-bending drama because ''Lost'' will end this season, this might intrigue you. The world blacks out for 15 minutes and everyone can see their future six months ahead. That notion has lots of implications but no explanations. It's not ''Lost,'' but at least initially it's intriguing. Joseph Fiennes stars. ABC, Sept. 24 at 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BROTHERS The big question of whether Michael Strahan can act is answered: yes. But that doesn't help this comedy much. He's an ex-football star who comes home to help out with the family restaurant. It's louder than it is funny. Fox, Sept. 25 at 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RESCUE INK UNLEASHED Tough guys with lots of tattoos show their sensitive side by saving animals from abuse. National Geographic, Sept. 25 at 10 p.m.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE CLEVELAND SHOW Cleveland, a comedy foil on ''Family Guy,'' hooks up with an old flame and moves his overweight family to a new town, where their neighbors are a family of bears. Hey, it's a cartoon. Among the voices: Arianna Huffington as mama bear. Fox, Sept. 27 at 8:30 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PREHISTORIC DISASTERS In 4.5 billion years a lot can go wrong. There's not a lot of footage, of course, but scientists can tell when big catastrophes changed the planet. Discovery, Sept. 27 at 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DAY AFTER DISASTER How experts look at previous disasters to prepare for new ones. History, Sept. 28 at 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRAUMA NBC said goodbye to ''ER'' in April, so it needs another medical show with lots of action; this fits the bill. The pilot has spectacular moments -- including a helicopter explosion -- that the series probably won't be able to afford again. That will place the burden on the cast, which has promise, led by Anastasia Griffith (''Damages''). NBC, Sept. 28 at 9 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HANK Kelsey Grammer likes to work in television, usually playing some version of rich, pompous and spoiled. He does it again here, though in a fish-out-of-water context. He loses his C.E.O. job and must move to a smaller house that most of America would kill for but which looks like a dump to Hollywood writers. Mr. Grammer may be looking for his next role soon. ABC, Sept. 30 at 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE MIDDLE Patricia Heaton was paired with Kelsey Grammer in their last show (''Back to You''), and now she follows him in another sitcom about middle-class life in the middle of the country. She has three kids, a job at a car dealership and lots of middle-American concerns. Funnier than it sounds. ABC, Sept. 30 at 8:30 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FINISHING HEAVEN A former film student named Robert Feinberg tries to complete his passion project 37 years after abandoning it, but finds that it's still difficult. HBO2, Sept. 30 at 8 p.m.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An obituary on Friday about the shopping-mall developer Melvin Simon misstated the location of the Mall of America, which he helped develop. It is in Bloomington, Minn., not Minneapolis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Tue Sep 22 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melvin Simon, who helped shape suburbia by developing shopping malls, eventually owning more of them than anyone else in the world, died Wednesday in Carmel, Ind., a suburb of Indianapolis. He was 82.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span> announced the death but gave no cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At his death, Mr. Simon owned the Indiana Pacers professional basketball team with his brother, Herbert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Simon, who grew up in a $30-a-month walk-up apartment in the Bronx and never lost his raspy New York accent, started his real estate empire by building small strip malls in Indianapolis. He expanded ever outward, first in the Midwest, where he was later a developer of the giant Mall of America, and then around the world. In many years, when most of his competitors were building one or two shopping centers, Mr. Simon would open half a dozen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company, <span class="companylink">Simon Property</span>, which is publicly held but controlled by the Simon brothers, owns 386 properties in North America, Europe and Asia, comprising 244 million square feet. It is the largest mall operator in the United States, with 2.8 billion shopper visits each year and sales in excess of $60 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Simon Property</span> is also the nation's largest retail real estate investment trust as measured by market capitalization. John Bucksbaum, chairman of <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties</span>, the second-largest mall operator, said in an interview on Wednesday that an ''aura of excitement'' surrounded Mr. Simon, who he said was ''always willing to experiment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail message, Robert S. Taubman, chairman, president and chief executive of <span class="companylink">Taubman Centers Inc</span>., another major mall operator, called Mr. Simon ''one of the key pioneers in an industry that became one of the most important in America.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, Mr. Simon was in the right place at the right time. Postwar Americans with new cars in new suburbs were eager to drive somewhere to spend their money. But he did more than buy cornfields on the cheap. He helped develop the business model for modern mall operators:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attract big anchor tenants like department stores by charging them less rent. Sign up a prestigious anchor even before a shovel is turned, so that banks will finance much or all of the development. Then charge smaller adjacent stores proportionately more. And require stores to pay a premium over basic rent if their sales exceed a certain level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burt P. Flickinger III, a consultant to the consumer industry, said Mr. Simon had an ''uncanny ability'' to identify the kinds of merchandise that would be successful. He also foresaw that department stores would be challenged by retailers that concentrated on a single area, like electronics, Mr. Flickinger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among <span class="companylink">Simon Property</span>'s most prominent projects, often done with partners, were the Mall of America in Minneapolis and the transformation of the old Gimbels store in Manhattan on 33rd Street into a vertical urban mall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Simon was one of the first developers to attract movie theaters into shopping centers, after noting that huge parking lots were largely vacant in the evening. In the late 1970s and early '80s, he ventured into movie production himself. By far his most financially successful effort was ''Porky's'' (1982), a raunchy adolescent classic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mel and Herb Simon bought the Pacers in 1983, at a time when city leaders feared the team would move to Sacramento. They promoted Donnie Walsh from assistant coach to general manager, and reached the Eastern Conference finals six times in 11 years. (Mr. Walsh is now the president of basketball operations for the New York Knicks.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melvin Simon was born in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn on Oct. 21, 1926. When he was a boy, his father, a tailor who had emigrated from Central Europe, moved the family to the Bronx, where Mel grew up. He excelled at school and graduated from the Bronx High School of Science. He graduated with a degree in accounting from the City College of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He then served in the Army and was stationed at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis. He supplemented his military pay by selling encyclopedias door to door. After his discharge, he accepted a job as leasing agent for $100 a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a couple years, I decided I wanted to be the person to make the decisions,'' he said in an interview with Indiana Business in 1991. ''That's how we got into developing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Herb and the other brother, Fred, went to Indianapolis to work for the company. Fred resigned in 1983 to pursue other interests. Mel owned two-thirds of the original company, Melvin Simon &amp; Associates, and Herb owned the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company went public as <span class="companylink">Simon Property</span> in 1993 in what was then the largest initial public offering in the history of real estate investment trusts. The Simon family remained the largest shareholder. Forbes estimated Mr. Simon's personal wealth at $1.3 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Simon's first marriage, to Bess Meshulam Simon, ended in divorce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to his brothers, Mr. Simon is survived by his wife of 40 years, the former Bren Burns; his daughters, Deborah Simon, Cynthia Simon Skjodt and Tammy McCauley; his son David; and 10 grandchildren. Another son, Joshua Max Simon, died in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his early days in business, Mr. Simon had a reputation for flamboyance, favoring tomato-colored suits. One widely circulated story tells of his throwing a shoe at Herb during a business meeting. He was always known for attentiveness: in one episode told by Forbes, he took the call from a merchant upset about signs in a parking lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why should he call some stranger?'' Mr. Simon said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The government said that housing construction rose in August to the highest level in nine months as a surge in apartment building offset a decline in single-family activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The August performance was another sign that the nation's housing industry had begun to recover from its worst downturn in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said in a statement that construction of new homes and apartments rose 1.5 percent to an annual rate of 598,000 units last month. That is slightly lower than the 600,000-unit pace that economists had forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase pushed building activity to the highest level since last November and left home construction 24.8 percent above the record low hit in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for building permits, a forecaster of future activity, posted a 2.7 percent rise in August to an annual rate of 579,000 units, slightly below the 580,000 level that had been forecast. Permits for single-family homes dipped by 0.2 percent while multifamily units rose by 15.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1.5 percent rise in housing starts followed a 0.2 percent dip in July. The August strength came from a 25.3 percent surge in construction of multifamily units, a volatile sector which had fallen by 15.2 percent in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The larger single-family sector dipped 3 percent last month to an annual rate of 479,000 units, the first setback after five straight monthly gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, construction shot up 23.8 percent in the Northeast and 0.9 percent in the Midwest. Activity was flat in the West and fell 2.4 percent in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the number of newly laid-off workers seeking unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since early July, evidence that layoffs were slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment insurance dropped to a seasonally adjusted 545,000 from an upwardly revised 557,000 the previous week. Wall Street economists expected claims to rise by 5,000, according to Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline is the third in the last four weeks. The four-week average, which smoothes fluctuations, dropped 8,750 to 563,000. That is still far above the 325,000 a week typical in a healthy economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people claiming benefits for more than a week rose by 129,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When federal extended benefits are included, 9.01 million people received unemployment insurance in the week ended Aug. 29. That was down from 9.16 million the previous week. Congress has added up to 53 weeks of extended benefits on top of the 26 weeks provided by the states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report comes a day after the Federal Reserve said production by the nation's factories, mines and utilities increased for the second straight month in August, the latest sign the economy is recovering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jobless rate is widely expected to peak next year above 10 percent, up from its current 9.7 percent. Some analysts say that claims need to drop below 400,000 before the unemployment rate will start to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the states, Washington had the largest increase in claims of 4,546, which it attributed to greater layoffs in the construction, public administration and manufacturing industries. The next largest increases were in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Illinois. The state data lags initial claims by a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California had the largest drop in claims of 2,751. The next largest decreases were in New York, Wisconsin, Texas and New Jersey.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOUNT KISCO, N.Y. -- Lord knows it's rough out there in the housing market. Still, you had to feel bad for Patty Bonadies, digging with a spoon in the rocky soil in front of the new three-story colonial for sale at 7 Old Roaring Brook Road in search of the tiny statue of St. Joseph she had buried in hopes of helping the house sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I should have brought a bigger spoon,'' she said. She wanted to move the statue, which she had planted near the front door in May, to a perhaps more propitious spot. Her late mother-in-law's house in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., is for sale, and she plans to plant a statue there, too. ''You have to believe,'' she said. ''In this market, you're looking for any help you can get.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Bonadies, a real estate agent for three years, is Roman Catholic, but St. Joseph, who is said to look after homes, families and carpenters, among many other things, isn't just for Catholics anymore. With the housing market still dismal, the Catholic tradition of planting a statue of him as a way to help a house sell is going like gangbusters online, in stores selling religious goods and elsewhere -- even if home sales are not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the past, we've seen some upticks in sales of the kits whenever there's a sign that the housing market is on the skids,'' said Nicholas Cole, director of marketing for the Catholic Company, based in Charlotte, N.C., which sells religious items online and through catalogs. ''But the sales of the product have been really strong for the last two years. We saw a really big spike last year, and they're still really selling. I don't want to say 'desperate' is the right word, but I think it's selling to people across the board, not just Catholics.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that the statue had helped him sell a house and a condominium in the past few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not completely clear when the tradition began, and devotees disagree over how best to participate. Head down? By the ''for sale'' sign? In a flowerpot? But it has been adopted by many real estate agents, who suggest that sellers, particularly in this market, give the statue a chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A religious-goods store in the area has four green-and-white St. Joseph kits -- a 3 1/2-inch plastic statue, a card with the words to a prayer to St. Joseph, and an instructional pamphlet -- on its front counter. The front of the kit shows the statue and a house with a ''sold'' sign. The back explains: ''Can't sell home? Ask St. Joseph. He's helping 1,000s.'' It adds, ''Faith can move mountains and homes!!!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And online, St. Joseph is everywhere. The Underground Real Estate Agent Kit offers four-inch and eight-inch statues; a book, ''St. Joseph, My Real Estate Agent''; and a free online home listing. On sites like Amazon.com, the reviews of the statues tend to be pretty straightforward. It either worked (''House had been on the market for 7 months and got an offer within 1 week of this statue's arrival'') or it didn't (''I fell for it! I bought the St. Joseph. I followed his instructions to the T and got no buyers for my house still after 2 months.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOME find the notion of magic house sales distasteful. ''If you just bury the statue in the ground, you're not going to sell your home,'' said Gerard Siccardi, whose family runs a religious-goods business in White Plains. ''You're supposed to pray. You're supposed to have some reverence about this. It's a faith-based item.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Stephen J. Binz, the author of 25 books on religion, including ''St. Joseph, My Real Estate Agent'' (''It's the lightest of them,'' he said), said that even on a casual level, there's a kind of grass-roots spirituality involved. ''I believe God can work in people's lives in all sorts of ways without our really understanding them,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, for whatever reason, the statue has plenty of fans, even if asking the right price might mean more than finding the right statue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Becwar, an observant Catholic, said he sold his house in Southampton, N.Y., soon after his mother suggested the statue and his real estate agent told him to plant it head down, facing the house, by the ''for sale'' sign. His brother in Chicago had the same experience, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Cheryl Katz, who is Jewish and works with Mrs. Bonadies, said the statue helped her sell two houses as a real estate agent. Now that her own house is on the market, she's using it for herself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You want to believe in something,'' she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD   </div><div>1147 words</div><div>16 September 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DALLAS -- When Congress passed an $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers last winter, it was intended as a dose of shock therapy during a crisis. Now the question is becoming whether the housing market can function without it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As many as 40 percent of all home buyers this year will qualify for the credit. It is on track to cost the government $15 billion, more than twice the amount that was projected when Congress passed the stimulus bill in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the view of the real estate industry and some economists, all that money is well spent. They contend the credit is doing what it was meant to do, encouraging a recovery in the housing market that is gathering steam. Analysts say the credit is directly responsible for several hundred thousand home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics argue that most of the money is going to people who would have bought a home anyway. And they contend that unless it is allowed to expire on schedule in late November, the tax credit is likely to become one more expensive government program that refuses to die.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate industry, including the powerful 1.1 million-member National Association of Realtors, wants Congress to extend the credit at least through next summer. The group hopes to expand the program to $15,000 and to allow all buyers, not just those who have been out of the market for at least three years, to qualify. The price tag on that plan: $50 billion to $100 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph and Chassity Myers are among the two million buyers eligible for the credit this year. The newlyweds heard they could get money from the government for something they were tempted to do anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a no-brainer,'' said Mr. Myers, a commercial underwriter. ''Owning something is the American family dream.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple bought a two-bedroom condominium here in the spring for $171,000 and amended their 2008 taxes immediately, receiving their windfall by direct deposit a few weeks later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their home is now a monument to the government's generosity. They bought a leather couch, a kitchen table, a bed, television stand, china cabinet, kitchen table, coffee table, grill and patio set.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We did exactly what the government wanted us to do,'' said Ms. Myers, a third grade teacher. ''We stimulated the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications increased nearly 10 percent for the week ending Sept. 3 from late August, the largest gain since early April and the latest of many signs of life in real estate. The upturn can be attributed to several factors: the return of confidence, very low mortgage rates, and prices in some markets that are at decade-low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the looming expiration of the tax credit on Nov. 30 seems to be playing a role too, particularly in relatively low-cost markets like Phoenix, Las Vegas and Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 50-year-old complex that the Myerses live in, grandly named the Lawn at Bluffview, provides a snapshot of the credit's influence -- and limitations. Two years ago, the buildings were converted from apartments to condominiums by their owner, a local developer. In January, before the credit, only 30 of the 70 units had sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, another seven units have sold, including the one bought by the Myerses. Brian Denbow, who works for a subprime auto financing firm, also was spurred to action by the credit. He too intends to use the money for furniture. Five of the buyers did not qualify for the credit for various reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lawn at Bluffview remains nowhere near full. Potential buyers ''just want a deal,'' said the sales agent, Beverly Bell. Two weeks ago, the price of the unsold units was cut 10 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors estimates that about 350,000 sales this year would not have happened without the lure of the tax credit. Moody'sEconomy.com used computer modeling to put the number at 400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's efforts to directly reward home buyers began more than a year ago with a $7,500 tax credit that had to be repaid over 15 years. Last winter, amid fears of another Great Depression, the Senate came up with a much sweeter $15,000 package as part of the stimulus bill. That measure was ultimately reduced to the $8,000 credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the sponsor of the original Senate bill, Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, is back with a new bill that would give a maximum $15,000 credit to any buyer who stays in a home for at least two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problem now is not first-time buyers, it's the move-up market -- the guy transferred from Chicago to Atlanta who can't sell his house,'' said Mr. Isakson, a former real estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without a new and more generous credit, he warned, there would be a downward spiral of home sales and more foreclosures, provoking a second recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate industry is lobbying heavily for the bill, but acknowledges that in an atmosphere that is less crisis-driven than last winter it will almost certainly have to settle for less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There will be a lot of water under the bridge, a lot of compromise, between now'' and a final bill, said Richard A. Smith, chairman of the Business Roundtable's Housing Working Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are sharply split on the merits of another round of government help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, favors expanding the credit to all home buyers, even investors, into next summer. ''The risks of not doing something like this are too great,'' he said. ''I don't think the coast is clear.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Glassman of <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> echoed those views but said he favored continuing to restrict the credit to first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other side of the issue is the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute. It labeled the original credit as one of the worst provisions of the stimulus package, on the grounds that the money is a bonus for people who would buy a house anyway. The center has an even dimmer view of extending the credit to all buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Is this the best way to spend money we don't have?'' asked senior fellow Roberton Williams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research called the credit ''a questionable redistributive policy'' from renters to home buyers, but said that he used it himself when he bought a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wrote on his blog: ''Thank you very much, suckers!''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the midst of an economic slump, a new 12-story building in Washington's central business district was sold this month in an all-cash deal for $207.8 million. The per-square-foot price of $830 was one of the highest ever paid in the nation's capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developed by <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, a real estate investment trust, the building, at 1999 K Street, has many attractive features, aside from its prime location in Washington, the nation's strongest office market, real estate specialists say. Its architect was Helmut Jahn, who is known for such buildings as the <span class="companylink">Sony</span> Center in Berlin, and it received the second highest certification from the United States Green Building Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what makes the building especially valuable is the fact that it is fully leased for the next 15 years. The tenant, Mayer Brown, a law firm with offices around the world, left two buildings in Washington and consolidated its offices at 1999 K on Sept. 1. The sales price exceeded the $750-a-foot value that Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach, Calif., company that specializes in real estate investment trusts, had placed on the building, said Michael Knott, an analyst with the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, by contrast, the <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span> Center, a three-year-old prime 42-story office tower at 1301 Second Avenue in downtown Seattle, was sold recently to the <span class="companylink">Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company</span> for $115 million, or $132 a square foot, according to a document filed in Kings County, Wash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bargain-basement price reflected the dismal state of the Seattle market, where no major office buildings had sold in nearly two years. The vacancy rate last quarter was 14.4 percent, and about 3.6 million square feet of space is under construction, according to Craig E. Hill, senior vice president at the brokerage <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was another important reason: more than half of the building may remain vacant. <span class="companylink">Russell Investments</span>, a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Northwestern Mutual</span>, will occupy part of the building -- a company spokeswoman would not say how much -- and the seller, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, which acquired the building last year in its takeover of <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>, will retain several floors, a bank spokeswoman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the real estate market was hot, investors coveted space that was vacant, or would soon be vacant, because rents were steadily rising. But now, vacancy detracts from the value of a building. ''In the past, the more vacancy a building had, the more valuable it was, because rents were on the move upward,'' said Douglas L. Harmon, a senior managing director of Eastdil Secured of New York. ''Now when you have vacancy, it applies downward pressure on values.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harmon advised <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> on its recent $590.3 million sale of Worldwide Plaza, a Midtown Manhattan building with 1.6 million square feet, which had been surrendered to the bank by the real estate investor Harry B. Macklowe. Mr. Macklowe had valued the building, which is on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, at $1.9 billion, or $1,000 a square foot, when he bought it in February 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time it was sold to a joint venture led by George Comfort &amp; Sons, the building's value had dropped to $369 a square foot. About 781,000 square feet are empty, according to CoStar, a research company in Bethesda, Md., including 600,000 square feet recently vacated by the advertising and public relations company Ogilvy &amp; Mather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners of One California Plaza, a 42-story building at 300 South Grand Avenue in Los Angeles, are also taking a haircut because of vacant space. The building is in contract to be sold to a New York company, Metropolitan Real Estate Investment, for roughly $225 million, or about $225 a square foot, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a research company. The seller is <span class="companylink">Macquarie Office Trust</span>, an Australian company, which paid $325 a foot for an 80 percent stake in the building in 2006. One-fifth of the building is unfilled, and a major tenant, the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, has not decided whether to renew leases that are expiring in a couple of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Investors today are very hesitant to make a mistake by underwriting improvement, decreasing vacancy or increasing rent,'' said Scott A. Singer, the executive vice president of the Singer &amp; Bassuk Organization, a New York company that arranges financing for transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacant floors force a new owner to spend much more money, and not just on marketing the space. The lobby may require sprucing up to attract tenants, for example. The space may sit vacant for a long time. ''It could take one year, or it could take three years,'' said H. Carl Muhlstein, an executive vice president in Los Angeles for Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To clinch a deal, the landlord must offer concessions like months of free rent and help in creating or refurbishing the offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing the largest concession packages I've seen in the last 25 years,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, the chief executive of the New York region for <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>. ''When you're calculating what it costs to buy something, concession packages have to be part of that calculation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional expenses will be accrued in converting a building that was designed for one tenant, like the <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span> Center in Seattle, to multitenant use, said Robert M. White Jr., the president of <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Von Ancken, the senior appraiser for <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis</span> in New York, estimated that well-leased Midtown Manhattan buildings that were commanding $800 to $1,000 a square foot in 2007 had declined by at least $300 a square foot. Substantial vacancies inflict an additional decline in values of as much as 30 percent, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Lower Manhattan, a fully occupied building with high-quality tenants would be priced at $300 to $400 a square foot, while one with significant vacancies would fetch $200 a square foot or less, he said. ''We're back to where we were in 2003 to 2004,'' Mr. Von Ancken said. He said it takes $750 a square foot to build in Manhattan, including ''soft'' costs like insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Young Woo &amp; Associates, a New York company, and <span class="companylink">Kumho Investment Bank</span> of Korea completed their purchase of two vacant buildings in Lower Manhattan, at 70 Pine Street and 72 Wall Street, that had previously been occupied by the insurer <span class="companylink">American International Group</span>. The price was about $150 million, or around $100 a square foot. The new owners plan to convert the buildings to residential use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty Corporation</span> recently agreed to sell a 49.5 percent stake in a 31-story building at 485 Lexington Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets, to a joint venture involving <span class="companylink">Optibase</span>, an Israeli video company, and Gilmor, a Nigerian engineering company, for $504.2 million, or $547 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building is not only almost fully leased to well-known companies like Travelers Insurance, but when loans are hard to get, it also has long-term financing at a low interest rate, said Howard L. Michaels, the chairman of the Carlton Group, an investment bank that brought in the overseas investors. ''That's like getting the last helicopter out of Saigon,'' he said. ''It doesn't exist anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Coren, a senior director at CB Richard Ellis Global Property Advisors, who advised Deka Immobilien, a German fund, on its purchase of 1999 K in Washington, said foreign investors are now looking for properties that they can keep for a long time. ''That's really how real estate should be treated -- as a long-term asset,'' he said. ''We had sort of lost that.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Tuesday about the sale of a house next door to President Obama's home in Chicago misstated the name of a dog that lives there and misidentified her owners. She is Rosie, not Roxy, and she belongs to the tenants of the property's carriage house -- not to the owners of the property for sale, Bill and Jacky Grimshaw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Thu Sep 17 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHICAGO -- There is a ''for sale'' sign in the front yard, not that potential buyers would see it. The street is closed to nonresidents by order of the United States Secret Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house at 5040 South Greenwood Avenue, next door to the Hyde Park residence of President Obama and his family, hit the market here over the weekend. And in a summer of real estate doldrums, it is causing quite a stir, not simply because it is a gracious, century-old, 17-room house with elaborate stained-glass windows and a charming carriage house in the backyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is what the owners say makes it a real deal: you just could not get more impressive neighbors. They are downright stately, and they come with a full-time security staff that keeps an eye out like no Neighborhood Watch in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill and Jacky Grimshaw are the empty-nesters who are selling their 6,000-square-foot house after 36 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price? Hard to know, real estate agents say, because not since Richard M. Nixon lived in a New York City apartment has the market tried to assess the value of immediate proximity to the president in a dense urban neighborhood. (The Greenwood Avenue neighbors are separated by about 20 feet, a line of thin trees and an iron fence that is more decorative than forbidding.) The Grimshaws paid $35,000 in 1973; other homes in the area have sold for $1 million to $2.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think there's a premium,'' said Matt Garrison, the listing agent with Coldwell Banker, who does not intend to put an asking price on the house. ''We don't know what the Obama effect is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Garrison said he had tried to scout similar parcels of residential property, but pointed out that there was no family living next door to the White House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I tried to look at 12 Downing Street, but that's all offices,'' Mr. Garrison said, referring to the building next door to the British prime minister's residence in London. ''Here we are looking out the kitchen window at the president's back porch. Buyers establish the market. Stuff sells for what people are willing to pay.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the third floor, in a playroom, a large picture window offers a sweeping view of the red brick Georgian-style house that Mr. Obama bought in 2005 for $1.65 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking out that window, Mr. Garrison was taken by surprise. ''Obama's roof needs some work,'' he said. Well, at least now they know, he joked: ''The Secret Service is probably looking at us, reading our lips.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Grimshaws -- he a professor of political science at the Illinois Institute of Technology and she a transit expert and Democratic political activist -- said they had managed to have an easy, neighborly rapport with the Obamas, who shot a commercial in the Grimshaws' living room during the campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They didn't want to mess up their own house,'' Professor Grimshaw said in jest. ''Thirty people came traipsing in asking, 'Are these the best chairs you have to set at the table?' I thought, 'What a nutty lark this is.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama children, Sasha and Malia, are known to stick their hands through the fence to pet the Grimshaws' boxer, Roxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone involved in the sale agreed that prospective buyers would have to be screened for security reasons before being taken seriously, but a spokesman for the Secret Service would not comment on that process or anything related to the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Grimshaw, an almost-retired 71-year-old, said he never had to lock his doors. ''But I also know that there are some people who would never live under these circumstances,'' he said. ''I'm just hoping for a good patriot, a good family man, a good Democrat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would he sell to a Republican?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Only if push came to shove,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, all the shoving seems to be from the curious who want to get a peek inside the house. Already more than 7,000 people have visited the broker's Web site, www.5040Greenwood.com[http://www.5040Greenwood.com].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A visit -- if one is qualified to be granted a private showing -- will reveal that the house is also a fixer-upper. The Grimshaws did not tamper with its original fixtures or woodworking. The electrical switches are from 1907. The kitchen and bathrooms are worn. The third floor probably needs to be gutted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't lavish attention on the house,'' Professor Grimshaw admits. Mocking an outraged, imaginary potential buyer, he said: ''Where's the granite? How can people live like this?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Grimshaw has been in poor health lately. The property, which sits on a 12,000-square-foot lot, requires too much upkeep now, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even looking back to when he bought it, Professor Grimshaw said, ''We had no means to support a place like this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says they had no idea, back then, about how the larger middle- and working-class area would evolve into a premier address.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their welcome to the area back in the 1970s? Some rough teenagers from a few blocks over broke in before they had even unpacked their boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somehow, Professor Grimshaw said, he is pretty sure the new owners will not have to worry about things like that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A GLANCE at Lawrence Greene's rustic colonial with wraparound porch in Livingston Manor, N.Y., might lead one to believe it's a 150-year-old farmhouse. In fact, it's two years old, one of the greenest houses in New York State, and built in a factory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1,800-square-foot structure was constructed by New World Home, a company that offers environmentally responsible prefabricated houses in a variety of architectural styles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greene, a trademark lawyer with a Manhattan firm, bought the three-bedroom modular house for $360,000 in March and uses it on weekends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a house that one can feel good about living in if one is trying to live green,'' Mr. Greene said. ''At the same time, one can enjoy the house because it has such an innate charm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eco-friendly aspect of the house is enhanced by the use of vintage appointments, like two 1860 fireplace mantels from brownstones in New York City, antique chandeliers and an elderly claw-foot tub. Mr. Greene said he had to convince the building inspector that it wasn't a restored house. But, at the same time, plumbers and electricians have marveled at the hardware in his very 21st-century basement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New World Home ''applies great ingenuity, not only in terms of how to build a house that's ecologically favorable, but also that is aesthetically enviable,'' Mr. Greene said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modular construction -- houses manufactured as modules at a factory and then assembled on site -- is inherently greener than conventional ''stick-built'' construction, said Mark Jupiter, a founder and the president of the product division of New World, which is two years old and has headquarters in Manhattan. Fewer materials are used and less waste is generated, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The efficiencies and economies of scale that a factory brings just blow site-built houses out of the water, if done right,'' Mr. Jupiter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New World's houses have more than two dozen other features that make them eco-friendly, including metal roofing with recycled content and motion-detecting light switches. They have hookups for mechanical systems like solar panels, geothermal energy or wind turbines, but don't depend upon them for their green status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A green house, to truly call it that, can't rely on mechanical systems,'' Mr. Jupiter said. ''The only thing that's truly going to make a house green is the thermal envelope being as tight as possible. That means building a house that doesn't leak at all, combined with proper insulation for the region, and choosing to eliminate contaminants within the construction materials.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The houses cut energy consumption in half and reduce water use by 20,000 gallons annually, providing homeowners with big savings, beginning the first day of occupancy, Mr. Jupiter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greene's house has double-paned windows for insulation, and ceiling fans and cross-ventilation cool the home without air-conditioning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The front door doesn't even have a storm door,'' Mr. Greene said. ''And it's so secure and airtight that no cold air gets inside in the winter, and it's perfectly cool when you walk inside in the summer on the hottest day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New World Home doesn't build its own homes, but gives its specifications to modular builders like Future Home Technology in New York and Haven Custom Homes of Maryland. The houses can be built for as little as $70,000 with no upper limit on price for custom-built homes, said Tyler Schmetterer, the company's other founder and chief operating officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only two or three companies now produce green modular housing routinely, and typically their prices range from $250 to $800 a square foot. New World averages about $150 to $200 a square foot. The company is also exploring affordable housing, which would be $70 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Mr. Schmetterer and Mr. Jupiter acknowledge that they've had to struggle to overcome a stereotype that plagues the modular construction industry -- one of flimsy wooden structures and unattractive vinyl siding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That stigma is slowly but surely becoming archaic and will eventually become extinct,'' Mr. Jupiter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New World Home's principals say they can build a house in 60 to 90 days. If homeowners choose, they can apply for certification from the United States Green Building Council and the National Green Building Program. This can be useful in states that encourage green building practices, like New York, which will offer up to $7,500 per qualifying single-family home starting Jan 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Eventually, if people decide to move, the green certification should significantly contribute to the resale value of the home as well,'' Mr. Schmetterer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New World Home is partnering with developers to create subdivisions in about 10 states, along with individual homes. Besides Mr. Greene's, New World has completed one in Jeffersonville, N.Y., and now has houses under construction in East Hampton, Millbrook and Cornwall, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greene said he bought his weekend home for its quaint historic ambience more than anything else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea that the home was eco-friendly was, in a way, icing on the cake, because it was so delightful in many ways,'' he said. ''So I do my best to uphold the standard by not doing things like applying weed killer or insecticides to the lawn. I'm really trying to do things that are ecologically sensitive now.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANY home buyers align themselves with real estate agents who, while touring a home, can help to calculate a mortgage payment based on various negotiating strategies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with the proliferation of software applications for iPhones and BlackBerrys, these on-the-fly calculations can be replaced by more precise calculations. And the software programs are quite cheap, typically starting at $1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those looking to refinance a loan, free online calculators offered by lenders and real estate companies might suffice. But for home shoppers, a mobile mortgage calculator brings instant and precise information to the process. Such aids certainly have become more commonplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Daniels, a senior sales associate with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, recalled seeing a young man tapping away on his BlackBerry last month, while his wife discussed possible sale prices for condominiums at Windows on 123, in Harlem. ''At first I thought he was just answering e-mails,'' Mr. Daniels said. ''But they were actually figuring out different scenarios of how much money to put down, and what their payment would be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's much better as a buyer to see those numbers generated with your own calculations, rather than asking a broker who might guesstimate,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toni Habetz, an agent at Prudential Connecticut Realty, said that she had also observed clients using mobile mortgage calculators during house tours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clients aren't as forthcoming about how much financial information they divulge,'' she said. ''And now they don't have to, because they can figure out the mortgage information for themselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These new applications are fairly straightforward calculators, but they can also include other information and features to help aid the mortgage decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take, for instance, the Mortgage Calculator Pro ($8 for BlackBerry users). After users enter a mortgage amount, interest rate, taxes, property insurance fees and preferred loan term, the program displays monthly payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also supplies comparative results. The purple color-coded data refer to a submitted loan term, while orange results show what users would pay in interest and total loan payments for the life of the loan, if they instead choose different loan terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less helpful, but still interesting, is a feature that lets users type in a desired monthly payment and interest rate, and then determines how long it would take to pay off the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no way to provide a precise calculation, however, for those who will have to have private mortgage insurance, because they are not planning to make a down payment of at least 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage insurance rates vary so much that such calculations would be unreliable, said Gregory Raiz, the president of the Raizlabs Corporation in Brookline, Mass., which produces the Mortgage Calculator iPhone and iPod touch application ($1). The Mortgage Calculator is a good example of how the simpler mobile applications work. With sliders and data-entry fields, the software determines the monthly payment on a single screen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program also allows users to type in the square footage of the property, for comparing different homes. Users may send the results of the calculation to themselves, with notes, as e-mail messages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are dozens of other mortgage calculators available for iPhones, including the Mortgage Calculator Pro from SVT Software, the CalcsPro-Mortgage Calculators from Mortal Geek and Recalc from Anil Bajaj.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These applications will have a limited impact, at least in the current market, according to Thomas Vanderwell, a mortgage officer at a bank who blogs at Straighttalkaboutmortgages.com about real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anytime you can have exact information rather than ballpark information, that's a good thing,'' Mr. Vanderwell said. ''But in the last six to nine months, most buyers are cautious, and they don't move so fast that they need that information when they're looking at the house.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEWS The typical American household made less money last year than it made a decade ago, according to new figures from the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEHIND THE NEWS In the four decades that the bureau has been tracking household income, median income has never failed to rise until now. Adjusted for inflation, it slipped to $50,303 last year from $51,295 in 1998. One reason: economic growth in the current decade has been slower than in any decade since before World War II. Income inequality also expanded, to the benefit of a small slice of the wealthy. ''We've seen a lost decade for the typical American family,'' said the economist Lawrence Katz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEWS The number of families threatened with losing their homes held steady last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEHIND THE NEWS A report by RealtyTrac Inc. suggested that efforts by lenders to helped troubled borrowers may be having a gradual impact. Bank repossessions actually dropped 13 percent from July. Still, more than 358,000 foreclosure-related filings were recorded in August, one for every 358 homes in the United States. That was up 18 percent from a year ago, despite a new Federal Reserve survey that suggested the recession is ending. Nevada had the nation's highest foreclosure rate, followed by Florida, California, Arizona and Michigan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEWS An exotic mortgage that became popular during the housing boom is now threatening to put a brake on any revival in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEHIND THE NEWS Interest-only loans put off principal payments for 5, 7 or 10 years. But those interest-only periods are now beginning to expire and many of those mortgages will become unaffordable as homeowners start paying principal, which can push up monthly payments by as much as 75 percent. Making matters worse, many of those homes are now worth less than the loans against them. In the next 12 months, $71 billion of those mortgages will reset. And the numbers get bigger in coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEWS The partnership that owns the 110 apartment buildings at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village in Manhattan are facing default after paying $5.4 billion for the complex three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEHIND THE NEWS The 11,227 apartments, more than half of them rent-regulated, have long been an oasis of affordability for middle-class New Yorkers. But the complex has lost more than half its value since Jerry I. and Rob Speyer and BlackRock Realty bought it. Analysts say the partners are at ''high risk'' of default.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GISELE BUNDCHEN, the Brazilian model, has dipped a toe into the Manhattan real estate market once again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, she put her four-story town house on Barrow Street in the West Village on the market for $13.95 million. The asking price is quite a bit more than the $8.85 million that a similar town house next door sold for two years ago, and that was near the top of the real estate market. The buyer was the Mexican artist Gabriel Orozco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not known whether the nesting impulse or some other real estate sensibility drove Ms. Bundchen to put the town house on the market now, just as brokers talk about a firming or bottoming Manhattan market, and she declined comment through a spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bundchen was reported to have married Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback, twice this year, once in February in Los Angeles, and a second time in April in Costa Rica. In June, People magazine said that she was pregnant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bundchen bought the Barrow Street house in 2005 for $5.8 million through a limited liability corporation, but two years later filed a building permit under her own name to install five rooftop air-conditioning units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fall 2007, Ms. Bundchen put a 1,700-square-foot triplex penthouse, on 11th Street near West Street and the Hudson River, on the market for $10.9 million, including a rooftop hot tub. She cut the price to $7.9 million and then, $5.9 million. It was relisted last week with Raphael De Niro, of Prudential Douglas Elliman, for $4.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. De Niro also has the Barrow Street listing. He declined to discuss either place, but said that sellers who could afford to hold off have again begun to list properties.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE recession has been pinching the real estate market in New York, in ways both obvious and mysterious. Last month, ABC announced that the long-running soap opera ''All My Children'' would move to studios in Los Angeles, after 40 years of production in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so actors and staff members are exploring the intricacies of bicoastal life, or are preparing to give up their New York apartments and houses for a new life on the West Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cameron Mathison, who plays Ryan Lavery, a tragic hero and one-time con man, has put his modernist brownstone on West 130th Street, in Harlem, on the market for $2.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mathison said it was a sad time in New York television production history, but an opportunity for Manhattan home buyers, in particular for a buyer interested in his 20-foot-wide brownstone, which has a garden dominated by a Buddha statue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a tricky situation,'' he said. ''We envisioned being in this place forever, but in order to keep my job on 'All My Children,' we have to pack it up and move across the country.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mathison and his wife, Vanessa, discovered Harlem almost by accident. After the birth of their first child, they began to look for a larger apartment on the West Side, but found prices outrageously high, even before considering co-op and condominium monthly charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They saw an ad for a brownstone, spent a weekend roaming a neighborhood that Mr. Mathison had never visited before, and decided it would be a great place to live. ''It reminded me of 'Sesame Street,' '' he said. ''There were people sitting out the stoops, kids playing in the street. It felt like we were in the suburbs, but still in Manhattan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house they found at 136 West 130th Street was caught up in the relentless reincarnation of Harlem as a genteel residential neighborhood over the last decade. Once divided into apartments, it had become a vacant shell. Bill Rohlfing, a developer, bought the property for $425,000 in 2002 and began to transform it into a one-family house. Mr. Rohlfing retained the brownstone exterior, but modernized the interior by exposing old brick and installing recessed lighting and a floating steel staircase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, the Mathisons paid $1.225 million for the house, then 80 percent finished, and hired Mr. Rohlfing to install the custom finishes to complete the job. Now it is being offered by Norman Horowitz, a broker at Halstead Property, who also has the listing for the vacant shell next door ($895,000).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house has three bedrooms, two baths and a playroom with a skylight on the top level, as well a master bedroom with a two-person tub. The open parlor floor has a fireplace, a kitchen and a living room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Mathisons are looking for a home near his new studio, somewhere around Pasadena, Calif.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Janet Bushor's roommate moved out of the two-bedroom apartment they shared on the Upper West Side of Manhattan last year, Ms. Bushor installed a new resident: an eight-foot-long ballet barre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bushor, 47, is a former musical theater dancer turned personal trainer. She has made her living space into a one-bedroom with a workout studio, and now charges $75 an hour to teach her mostly female clientele to squat, thrust and plie at weekly one-on-one sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike conventional gyms, there is no membership fee, so, Ms. Bushor says, her clients save money. But she saves, too, because she does not have to give a percentage of her fee to an employer, as personal trainers who work out of sports clubs often must. There's also the boon of being your own boss. At gyms, ''they want you to stand by the machine and count,'' she says. At home, ''I do my own thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As long as there have been homes, there have been home businesses. And for almost as long, there have been leases, landlords and laws that frowned upon home businesses. But in a challenging economy, more people are resorting to relocating businesses from shop fronts or other commercial spaces to spots under their own roofs. Others are starting businesses at home after losing jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With these economic pressures, people are trying to find creative ways to pay their rent,'' said Jaya Madhavan, a supervising judge of Bronx Housing Court, where innovative rent-paying measures that run afoul of leases can wind up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords are often unaware that their tenants are operating home businesses; such enterprises come to the housing court's attention only when a landlord catches on and decides to take steps to evict the offending tenant. In-house businesses wind up in still other courts when city statutes -- like plumbing regulations and occupancy rules -- are violated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of shingles hanging inside apartment doors is difficult to say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's impossible to quantify just how many people are newly engaging in home businesses,'' said Ernesto Belzaguy, the first deputy chief clerk of the Civil Court of New York City, of which housing courts are a part. Courts don't keep a record of these sorts of cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When questioned via e-mail message, 10 New York City Housing Court judges said they saw no discernible uptick in cottage industry evictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Judge Madhavan said that pragmatic landlords are very likely turning a blind eye and staying away from housing court. ''There is a lot of it going on, and there are landlords that are aware of it but are keeping quiet about it, because they recognize that it's a way for a tenant to pay their rent,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bushor said she didn't believe that her landlord or her neighbors are aware of her business, because she sees only 7 to 10 clients in her apartment once or twice a week. Before her roommate's departure, Ms. Bushor worked in her clients' homes or in fitness facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The layout of the apartment, a duplex, has also helped her to avoid making waves. Her new gym is on the floor above her bedroom, rather than above her neighbors' heads. Living on the first floor of a nondoorman walk-up building helps, too. ''It's not like there is a doorman, or I am on the fourth floor so they are passing everyone on the stairs,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating a business in your apartment can be a simple lease violation, or illegal and in violation of city codes. Businesses that have a constant stream of foot traffic -- hair salons, masseuses -- often violate reasonable-use clauses in lease agreements. An <span class="companylink">eBay</span>-type sales business might also be a problem if there's continual shipping and delivery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is notoriously difficult to be evicted in New York, but if taken to court and found in breach of a lease, a tenant is typically given 10 days to cure, or stop, the problem, or face eviction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Landlords and co-op boards are very protective of the other tenants' privacy, as well as protecting their buildings against people coming in and coming out without security,'' said Gary J. Wachtel, a lawyer who specializes in landlord-tenant disputes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even at-home dog groomers or cat boarders can run into trouble with their leases. ''Foot traffic not only could be foot traffic but animal traffic, too,'' Mr. Wachtel said. ''Paw traffic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some businesses are flat-out illegal, Judge Madhavan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One tenant who ran a nightclub out of his apartment, for example, violated city rules against overcrowding. Tinkering with the plumbing (adding more toilets) or the gas (to cook commercially) can be considered a nuisance, and can be dangerous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Someone decides that they need an industrial stove with six burners, but the gas supply is designed for residential use,'' Judge Madhavan said. ''It's a real threat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents who modify utilities for commercial use or who cause overcrowding in an apartment face stiff penalties. If the landlord decides to take them to court, they may be found guilty of nuisance violations, and are given no option to cure the situation. Eviction proceedings could start immediately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penalties like fines depend on whether a fine is stipulated in the lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in actual practice, tenants convicted of a nuisance violation are frequently given a second chance, a probation period in which they agree not to continue the activity. Often, said Glenn H. Spiegel, a partner at Finkelstein Newman Ferrara who has handled these types of cases, these tenants are required to pay the landlord's legal fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The type of building can play a part in how long a home-based entrepreneur can evade detection, Mr. Spiegel said. ''Depending on what the specific rules are for a condominium and co-op, the condominium or co-op may have an easier time restricting the use of a particular apartment,'' he said. ''The courts are more apt to enforce the co-op or the condo's house rules.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some home businesses are so small that they might be considered, disturbance-wise, less bothersome to others than a supersized stroller parked in a hallway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year and a half ago, Seth Adler, 33, an event producer, realized his dream of becoming a voice-over actor by creating an in-house sound studio in the closet of his one-bedroom apartment in the East Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the business is self-contained and clients do not come to visit, Mr. Adler believes he is operating within the scope of his lease. And though his business required some home modification, he said he doesn't think he violated any city codes. He simply stapled panels of sound-blocking egg-crate foam from floor to ceiling in the small closet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this homemade studio, Mr. Adler uses his honeyed voice to create 30-second advertising spots. Each earns a couple of hundred dollars, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Were he to use a professional recording studio space, which can cost around $500 per session, he says, ''there's a good shot that I would make no money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Mr. Adler's voice-over work is a side pursuit in addition to his full-time job, having a home business has helped ease financial worries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Around the third quarter of 2008, we all got extremely nervous,'' he said. ''Knowing that I had a couple of irons in the fire certainly made me rest at least a little bit easier.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all examples are as low-impact as Mr. Adler's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 28-year-old renter in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, says his landlord has no idea that he sometimes records and mixes aspiring hip-hop artists and rappers in the living room of the apartment that he shares with his mother and two siblings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he used to have periodic work helping with crowd control at events like the Barneys warehouse sale, he said the jobs stopped coming last February. For the last six months, recording and producing would-be singers and rap stars at the rate of $20 an hour -- Mr. Adler says a professional recording studio can cost more than 10 times as much -- has been his sole source of income, roughly $10,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said customers accept the unusual setting because of the rock-bottom price and his product. ''They are usually cool with it after they hear the sound quality,'' he said. ''They are like, 'I did not expect that from the setup.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stacy Pitt's home hairstyling business was so profitable that she was able to move it three months ago from the rent-stabilized studio that she shares with her boyfriend in the East Village to another studio in a nearby residential building. Her combined rent is $2,100 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She decided to rent the second studio after a year and a half of searching for a neighborhood storefront turned up only small spaces with rents of $4,000 to $6,000 per month, far beyond her budget. Renting a pricey space, she said, would force her to charge much more for her services and might cause her to lose her clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't want my clients to have to pay for me wanting more room,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pitt, who starts her day of $70 highlights and $35 to $45 haircuts at 7 a.m. and keeps snipping until 9 p.m. or later six days a week, said her business has boomed as the recession closed in because clients are looking for a cheaper alternative to a salon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pitt said she now earns more than she did as a salon stylist. Then, the house took 50 percent of her earnings, an industry standard. She also charges less than her clients are used to, because of the low overhead of the apartment setting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salon owners do not appreciate that distinction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a serious drain on the business community,'' said Joseph Strafaci, the owner of Joseph Martin Salon on East 57th Street in Manhattan. ''Every downturn, every retraction, those individuals who do freelance work swoop in. Businesses can't compete with individuals who have no operating expenses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Ms. Pitt opened a home salon out of necessity, the apartment aesthetic is now part of the hook. The studio where she cuts hair features a fold-out bed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clients get their hair washed in the kitchen sink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment setting, she said, gives the salon an indie, underground cachet. Customers, she observed, ''loved the kitschy-ness of it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a very cool thing for them; everyone likes to feel like they found something,'' Ms. Pitt said. ''Like they found a little secret.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too many people bought too much house for too many years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the financial system almost collapsed because mortgage bankers and brokers told lies about loan terms and loosened standards in dangerous ways, and investment bankers packaged those loans into bonds that were far more toxic than ratings agencies predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the roots of the mortgage contagion lie with all of us and our desire to own just a bit more house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So as the one-year anniversary arrives of our near financial collapse, it's a good time to blow up a long-standing but underexamined maxim of real estate -- that you should always stretch financially when buying your first home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one is quite sure who came up with this idea, though suspicions rest on real estate agents or kindly parents with the best of intentions who never expected that real estate prices could fall. Whatever its origin, the economists and financial planners I spoke with this week are almost unanimous in their rejection of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how they dismantled the old saw -- and a list of seven suggestions they offered up in its place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">START WITH THE BASICS Let's begin with some other standards, tried and true advice that served banks and borrowers well for years, until they forgot all about them in the race to write more loans and buy bigger houses. Put 20 percent down, so you have less of a chance of owing more than your home is worth if prices fall again. Get a fixed-rate mortgage, so the biggest part of your monthly housing bill remains stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're determined to be truly conservative, don't spend more than about 35 percent of your pretax income on mortgage, property tax and home insurance payments. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, which adheres to the guidelines that <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> set, will let your total debt (including student and other loans) hit 45 percent of your pretax income, but no more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, if you end up with an adjustable-rate loan, banks may not be concerned with whether you'll be able to afford the maximum possible payment when the interest rate adjusts in five or seven years. But you should be worried about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONSIDER YOUR INCOME The best case for stretching for a first house is that first-time home buyers in their 20s and 30s will probably see their incomes grow more quickly than older people buying their second or third home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvey S. Rosen, a Princeton economics professor, finds in a forthcoming Journal of Finance article that he co-wrote with two Federal Reserve Bank economists, Kristopher Gerardi and Paul S. Willen, that the size of a house that someone buys tends to be a good indicator of what their income will be later. ''People can, on average, make reasonably good predictions of their future incomes and act on them in sensible ways by buying bigger houses,'' Mr. Rosen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, much of the mess in the mortgage market has been because of people borrowing money with loans that they didn't understand -- or betting that housing prices would continue to rise enough that they would be able to refinance their loans before the payments rose. Income overconfidence may have had something to do with it (and high unemployment worsened the problems), but it's probably not the primary cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOW TO UNKNOWNS This research is all well and good as long as you continue to work. But if you're buying your first home before you have children, you may feel quite differently about work once you become a parent. And if you do, you may not want a mortgage boxing you in to going back to the office three months after the baby is born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bobbie D. Munroe, a financial planner with Fraser Financial in Atlanta, encourages younger clients in this situation to model out their budget, including any proposed mortgage, three ways -- with both spouses working full time, one working part time and one staying at home for a few years. She also suggests imagining or even practicing living on one income, to see if it's truly realistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What people should do is ultimately their own decision,'' she said. ''But they should do it with eyes wide open.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even people who don't want to have children need to consider this. Besides the obvious possibility of sustained unemployment, what about the need to escape a dying industry or an early midlife crisis that necessitates career change to stave off depression? Even government employees and medical residents who believe that their incomes are set for life ought to consider this possibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MAP OUT EXPENSES It stands to reason that anyone tempted to stretch for a house will be inclined to play down the expense of maintaining it. These costs are anything but ancillary, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many years, Dennis G. Stearns, a financial planner in Greensboro, N.C., has been alarmed enough by clients' unrealistic expectations that he's maintained a home cost spreadsheet that he shares with clients shopping for houses. He also updates it periodically with aggregate, real-world data based on their subsequent experiences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stearns estimates that owners of a newer home that do some work for themselves but contract major work out to others will pay 3.6 percent of the original purchase price annually for maintenance and 4.5 percent if it's an older home. So if you own a $400,000 home, your costs will probably hit the five figures each year -- and may rise with inflation. These expenses will be another 20 percent or so higher if you live in a severe weather area. He does note, however, that the tax benefits of home ownership can offset half or more of these costs in some areas of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUY BEST (OR CHEAPEST) All of these caveats have given rise to some unusual strategies. Michael Kalscheur, a financial planner with Castle Wealth Advisors in Indianapolis, suggests buying the dream house you covet (if you can afford it) or an inexpensive starter house but not anything in the middle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If people have their heart set on something, inevitably, if they can't afford what they really want, they buy the next best thing,'' he said. ''That's absolutely the worst thing you can do. Not only do you not get what you want, but it sucks you dry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? Well, if you buy that entry-level home instead of the silver-medal home, you can save a lot more money each month after making the house payment (as long as you're disciplined) than you would if you were paying a big mortgage toward that next best house. And all of your other housing costs will be lower, too. Then, several years later, you're in a much better position to buy what you actually want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STRETCH THE HOUSE Better yet, keep in mind that you don't ever have to move from that first home -- and incur all of the transaction costs associated with selling and buying and moving again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">J. Michael Collins, an assistant professor in the department of consumer science at University of Wisconsin's School of Human Ecology in Madison, suggests paying less for a home that you can upgrade periodically when your income is stable and your savings or available credit make it possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, stretching out your tenure in a home (and the physical boundaries of the home itself) may make more sense than stretching for each successive mortgage in a series of two or more houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE EIGHT-HOUR RULE One rule about all of these rules is that it's unlikely that every one will apply to every circumstance. Individuals and their income streams are too varied, and real estate markets are themselves unique.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When all else fails, however, you can always fall back on the eight-hour test. Whatever the size of your mortgage, you have to be able to sleep soundly at night. So if an impending loan has you stretching for the Ambien, it's a pretty good sign that the loan is a bit of a stretch as well.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- So, Matt Barkley was asked after making his debut last Saturday as the University of Southern California's starting quarterback in a 56-3 trouncing of San Jose State, what did you learn about yourself today?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is fun, this is easy, this is what I was made to do,'' Barkley said. ''I really think God put me here for a reason. I'm just happy to be here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the toughest part of the day?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The run up the tunnel at halftime,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barkley laughed at that one. Though he was days away from his 19th birthday and had become the first true freshman quarterback to start a season opener for the Trojans, he appeared perfectly at ease in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barkley expects to feel just as much at home on Saturday at Ohio State, even amid 105,000 fans and the eighth-ranked Buckeyes, who are eager to avenge last year's 35-3 loss to U.S.C., which is ranked third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think so,'' he said when asked if his second assignment would be more difficult. ''Nothing will change except the environment. It doesn't matter -- the more energy the better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barkley's words may read like conceit, but there is sincerity in their sound. Why should playing in the Coliseum be a big deal, he wondered, when he had been there many times as a spectator? Why is starting as a college freshman, he reasoned, any different from starting as a freshman in high school? And why should Ohio State be any different from San Jose State? In some corners, this is the expected world view of a freshman. At U.S.C., it is a sign of providence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody has scattered more rose petals at Barkley's feet than Coach Pete Carroll. Remarkable, extraordinary and special are adjectives that pepper Carroll's comments about his quarterback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've said it repeatedly,'' Carroll said. ''We've had great football players and great kids play quarterback here, and nobody's been able to do it like he's been able to do it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 6 feet 2 inches and a sturdy 230 pounds, Barkley certainly looks the part. He is another promising quarterback from the O. C., following Carson Palmer, Matt Leinart and Mark Sanchez from the suburbs of Orange County. With his blond hair, blue eyes, dimpled grin and Newport Beach roots, Barkley is as much a U.S.C. cliche as the white horse and the cheerleaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He left high school a semester early, enrolling at U.S.C. in January. When Sanchez left early for the N.F.L., Barkley competed for the starting job in spring practice with the junior Mitch Mustain, who was 8-0 as a freshman starter at Arkansas, and the sophomore Aaron Corp. At first it seemed a courtesy, but Barkley passed Mustain in the spring. And when Corp -- who won the starting job -- cracked his left fibula last month, Carroll stunned some of his own players by naming Barkley the starter even though Corp would be well before the opener.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most surprising aspect of the decision was that it cast aside Carroll's most abiding principle: do not turn the ball over. In spring and summer scrimmages, Barkley threw 17 interceptions, while Corp threw two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This did not seem to be growing pains as much as it was a habit. In his senior season at Santa Ana Mater Dei, which has produced two Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks -- John Huarte and Leinart -- Barkley was intercepted 18 times. Four of those came in his last playoff game, including two that were returned for touchdowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The interceptions, I think, were him trying to do a little too much on his own,'' said Scott Meyer, the coach at Jordan High School in Long Beach, which lost to Mater Dei in the playoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those urges were neatly suppressed against San Jose State. On his first third-down play, Barkley threw the ball into the Trojans' bench. On his next, he took a sack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was kind of bumming at first, but that happens sometimes,'' Barkley said. ''Here, a check down is a great play, a throwaway is a great play, if we're not turning the ball over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impulse he could not contain was a smile. When Barkley was sacked or knocked down, it was still there, just as it was after a big play. When U.S.C. did not score on its first five possessions, there was no panic. When the touchdowns poured in, his celebrations were in line with his teammates'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We watched him in high school because their games were always on TV, and he was the star child,'' Alex Parsons, a senior guard, said Saturday. ''I was struggling as a freshman, and I didn't even play. I didn't even know he was a freshman.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the superlatives thrown at Barkley, the game plan Carroll threw at him was nonfat vanilla. He completed 15 of 19 passes for 233 yards and a touchdown. The play calls were almost exclusively bootlegs, bubble screens and rollouts. Barkley often had maximum protection, and he threw only one pass from the pocket and none to a target between the hash marks. ''They asked him to do some real simple things,'' said Kent Baer, the San Jose State linebackers coach. ''They didn't give him a lot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question now is whether that will change. Starting a true freshman at quarterback is one thing. Trying to win a national championship with one is rarer still. The last true freshman to start the opener for a top-five team was Rick Leach for Michigan in 1976, and the only true freshman to quarterback a major-college team to a national title was Oklahoma's Jamelle Holieway in 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Jose State Coach Dick Tomey, the former Arizona coach, called the Trojans' veteran offensive line the best he had seen. And its best member, center Kris O'Dowd, did not play. The best run of the day, a weaving 63-yarder, belonged to tailback Marc Tyler, who is fifth on the depth chart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With such an embarrassment of riches, the Trojans might find that having a quarterback like Barkley is a luxury they can afford.</p>

</div><div class="author">By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   </div><div>695 words</div><div>11 September 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garrett Atkins crushed a two-run homer and Jason Giambi hit a two-run double in a five-run third inning Thursday, as the Colorado Rockies beat the visiting Cincinnati Reds, 5-1, for their seventh straight victory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rockies pushed their lead over the San Francisco Giants in the National League wild-card race to four and a half games, and moved to two games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers in the N.L. West. The Giants and the Dodgers did not play Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By sweeping their four-game series with the Reds, the Rockies wrapped up a 9-1 homestand -- one of the best in franchise history. Colorado begins a nine-game trip Friday, which includes three games at San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rockies starter Jose Contreras, acquired from the Chicago White Sox on Aug. 31, strained his right quadriceps while trying to beat out a ground ball in the third inning and left the game. He allowed one run and four hits, striking out Wladimir Balentien and Adam Rosales to escape a bases-loaded jam in the first. In Contreras's absence, Colorado strung together three relievers who allowed just three hits the rest of the way. Juan Rincon (3-2) struck out five in three innings to earn the victory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colorado shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and third baseman Ian Stewart each sat out a third straight game because of back stiffness. Closer Huston Street has not pitched since Sept. 1 because of biceps tendinitis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seth Smith continued his torrid hitting with a run-scoring single in the third. He won Wednesday night's game with a two-run single in the ninth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giambi has six runs batted in in six games with Colorado. His double in the third glanced off the top of Drew Stubbs's glove in deep center. In the eighth, Stubbs reached over the wall to steal Giambi's potential home run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rookie Shines in Debut</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 24-year-old shortstop Ian Desmond homered and drove in four runs in his major league debut, and Livan Hernandez pitched into the eighth inning to help lead the Washington Nationals to an 8-7 victory against the visiting Philadelphia Phillies. The Phillies had won nine straight against the Nationals. ... Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel and his struggling closer Brad Lidge met to discuss Lidge's role with the team. ''We had a good talk,'' said Manuel, who declined to say if or when Lidge would get his job back as closer. Royals Rely on Defense</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Gordon and Alberto Callaspo homered and the Kansas City Royals turned five double plays in their 7-4 victory against the visiting Detroit Tigers, completing a three-game sweep. ...Royals starter Gil Meche is probably done for the season because of a shoulder problem, Manager Trey Hillman said. Meche is 6-10 with a 5.09 earned run average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Jays Stymie Twins</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rookie Brett Cecil (7-4) allowed two runs in six innings as the host Toronto Blue Jays beat the Minnesota Twins, 3-2. The Twins have not won consecutive games since taking three in a row from Aug. 30 to Sept. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surgery for Rays All-Star</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tampa Bay Rays slugger Carlos Pena had season-ending surgery to repair two broken fingers on his left hand. He was injured Monday when he was hit by a pitch from the Yankees' C. C. Sabathia. A first-time All-Star this season, Pena finished with 100 R.B.I. and leads the A.L. with 39 home runs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angels' Hunter Honored</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles Angels outfielder Torii Hunter was named the winner of the Branch Rickey Award in recognition of his work with children. Created by the Rotary Club of Denver in 1991, the award honors people in baseball who contribute to their communities. ''It means a lot,'' Hunter said of the award. ''That's part of your responsibility as a human being, and especially as a ballplayer.'' (AP)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the corner of Flamingo Road and Pink Flamingo Lane, beyond the putting green, the crystalline lagoon and the Sawgrass Mills mall, a soaring monument to the great condominium bust bakes under the Florida sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tao Sawgrass, as the twin-towered complex is known, was built on the western fringes of Fort Lauderdale with easy money from the now tottering condo king of American finance: Corus Bancshares of Chicago. Only about 50 of the 396 units have been sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 26-story Tao -- begun in 2006, just as the Florida real estate market imploded -- is one of the many troubled condominium projects that have mired Corus in red ink and now threaten its survival. Federal authorities are racing to broker a sale of Corus to avert yet another costly banking collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After failing to find a buyer for the entire company, regulators are moving to cleave the bank in two and sell its banking operations and condominium loans separately. The hope is to clinch a deal by the end of the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some big-time real estate investors are circling, among them Thomas J. Barrack, who first made his fortune in the aftermath of the savings and loan crisis; Barry S. Sternlicht, the man behind the Starwood empire; Jay Sugarman of <span class="companylink">iStar Financial</span>, the public real estate giant; and New York developer Stephen M. Ross, sometimes called the King of Columbus Circle, in league with Lubert-Adler, a big property investor in Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the outcome, Corus will go down as the great enabler of condo madness, and its travails are a harbinger of the pain yet to come in the troubled world of commercial real estate. More than any other condo lender, Corus epitomized the easy lending and lax oversight of the go-go years -- and the pain of the ensuing bust. Its share price, which was nearly $13 in February of 2008, has plummeted into the land of penny stocks, closing at 25 cents Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corus barreled into hot markets like California, Florida and Nevada and then kept lending as those markets boiled over. Rather than diversify, it concentrated its lending bets by financing only a handful of big, risky projects. And it poured its idle cash into a small group of other banks and financial companies that were upended when the crisis struck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary regulator of Corus, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, failed to sound the alarm until Corus was deeply troubled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are the perfect analogy of a boom-bust bank,'' said Jack McCabe, the head of a real estate research and consulting firm in South Florida. Corus executives, he said, behaved more like property speculators than bankers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The failure of Corus would cost an already strained <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> billions. It would also underscore the wave of troubled commercial real estate loans now threatening to crash down on much of the American banking industry. Construction and land loans are now the biggest problem for hundreds of deeply troubled lenders and pose far greater dangers than commercial loans or home mortgages, according to Foresight Analytics, a banking industry research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many analysts see trouble ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first big wave of losses for the banks were on loans to home builders and condo developers in once hot markets,'' said Andrew McGee, a consultant at <span class="companylink">Oliver Wyman</span> in New York. ''Banks now are worried that office buildings, hotels and malls in areas hardest hit by the downturn are going bad too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corus was not always so condo crazy. It used to be a sleepy family-run affair known as River Forest Bancorp. Then, in 1984, Robert J. Glickman took over from his father, Joseph C. Glickman, and began transforming the bank into a powerhouse in construction loans. Corus shut its student lending business, its trust operations and all but a handful of its Chicago area branches. It began catering to condo developers across the nation, offering developers quick loan approvals and attractive interest rates. Corus soon fanned out into hot markets like Atlanta, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Miami. As the property market exploded, so did Corus. Its assets reached nearly $10 billion in 2006. But almost all the loans were tied to the condo market, and nearly 40 percent were for more than $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Glickman kept reaching for more. Just off the Las Vegas Strip, Corus single-handedly financed a $108.2 million luxury development called Streamline Tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sunrise, Fla., locals shook their heads as Corus provided $126.3 million for the construction of the Tao, doubting that a luxury condo development on the edge of the Everglades could lure wealthy tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in downtown Miami, Corus financed the Ivy and the Mint, adjacent properties that were competing for the same buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was like building two Wal-Marts next door to each other and thinking you would double sales,'' Mr. McCabe said of the Miami projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, of course, the bottom fell out. By late 2007, the share price of Corus was under attack on Wall Street. But Robert Glickman, whose family then controlled nearly half of Corus, rebuffed offers to sell the bank. Instead, Corus paid a special dividend that netted the Glickman family about $25 million, even though the payout ate into the bank's reserves. By mid-2008, Corus was losing money and stopped making loans altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, in early 2009, federal regulators ordered Corus to raise capital or put itself up for sale. It was unable to do either. In late June, the bank reported that its entire capital base had been wiped out. Since then, its auditors, Ernst &amp; Young, have walked away, and Nasdaq has warned that it may delist Corus shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Glickman and his father, the chairman of Corus, left the company in April and recently sold their remaining shares for pennies on the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corus officials did not return phone calls seeking comment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, the sale of the 110 red-brick apartment buildings at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village in Manhattan represented the most expensive American real estate deal in history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the buyers are running out of time and money. Jerry I. and Rob Speyer and their partner, BlackRock Realty, who paid $5.4 billion for the quiet middle-class redoubt near the East River, have seen the property lose more than half of its value, and the income from rent -- down 25 percent from its peak -- covers less than half of their debt payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate analysts say they expect that by December, the partnership will run out of an additional $890 million set aside for apartment renovations, landscaping and interest payments, and that the owners are at ''high risk'' of default on $4.4 billion in loans. Two real estate executives who have been briefed on the finances insist the owners can hold out, but only until February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the partnership will go before the Court of Appeals in Albany to try to overturn a lower court decision that could force them to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in rent rebates to thousands of tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of that outcome, Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village are in trouble. City officials have been monitoring the looming crisis and how it might affect a complex that has served as an oasis of affordability in Manhattan for middle-class New Yorkers. Some 6,875 of the 11,227 apartments at the complexes are rent regulated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are absolutely keeping an eye on it,'' said Rafael E. Cestero, the city's housing commissioner. ''It's an iconic complex.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Referring to the people who were part of the original real estate transaction, he went on, ''Those folks are going to take their lumps. We are looking at how we can ensure that the rent-stabilized units and the families that live there and families that could live there in the future could be insulated from the unwinding of this deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the partnership's financial problems pointing to a possible default, tenants would not be likely to face high rent increases or eviction, but they may face a period of deferred maintenance and disinvestment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rob Speyer, who is co-chief executive of Tishman Speyer Properties with his father, Jerry, acknowledged the problems went beyond the need for a cash infusion from the partners and their investors, which include Calpers, the giant California pension fund that is the nation's largest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The asset is going to require a restructuring,'' he said. ''Once the court case is resolved, we'll speak to our debt holders as well as our fellow equity investors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer and BlackRock spent $6.3 billion -- the $5.4 billion purchase price and the creation of four reserve funds totaling $890 million -- to buy Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village from the original owner, Metropolitan Life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal has become a ''poster child'' for all that was wrong with that era of easy credit, highly speculative deals and greed, said Ben Thypin, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen if its recent troubles will affect the Tishman Speyer image and the willingness of investors to risk their money with the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent report from Realpoint, a credit rating agency, estimates the property has a value today of $2.13 billion -- less than half of what the partnership borrowed to buy it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The lender has to determine its own interests, as does the equity,'' Rob Speyer said. ''When the time comes we will be fair and reasonable and hope to get a new deal done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other developers, Tishman Speyer has been hurt by the collapse of the real estate and credit markets. A partnership led by the Speyers defaulted recently on debt payments for its $2.8 billion acquisition of CarrAmerica, a collection of 28 prime office buildings in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That partnership's $22 billion purchase of <span class="companylink">Archstone-Smith Trust</span>, a collection of 400 apartment complexes, has also fared poorly. Earlier this year, the banks that financed the deal were asked to pour in an additional $500 million to give Archstone more time to sell properties and reduce its debt. Tishman Speyer, whose investment fund invested $250 million in the deal expecting to get 13 percent of the profits, declined to participate in further financing. Its 1 percent stake was reduced substantially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rob Speyer said that in both cases the properties have ''a lot of long-term value.'' But the bad deals represent only a fraction of the $35 billion in real estate assets that it owns or manages around the world. At the market's height, he said the company sold $10 billion worth of property over six months in 2007, including the former New York Times Building in Manhattan, which went for $525 million, three times what it paid less than three years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Speyers insist their company is still providing investors with ''20 percent returns'' and has $2 billion to invest in new deals. ''You show me anybody who measured up to that standard,'' Jerry Speyer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the purchase of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village was one of the more scrutinized of its deals in recent years. The winning bid presumed the partnership could increase profits by renovating and deregulating apartments, but the owners have been unable to quickly convert apartments to market rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel R. Garodnick, a city councilman who lives in Peter Cooper Village, said Tishman Speyer had problems of ''its own making.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Residents are increasingly concerned that the maintenance of the buildings is slipping, even as they are getting hit with a flurry of potential charges for major capital improvements,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the Tishman Speyer partnership and the prior owner, Met Life, had wrongfully deregulated about 4,350 apartments and raised rents beyond certain set levels, while receiving tax breaks from the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer, Met Life and much of the real estate industry in New York appealed to the state's highest court If the Appellate Court is upheld, the market-rate tenants could seek treble damages, which could cost the partnership more than $200 million. Even if it the ruling is overturned, the partnership still must renegotiate its loans or face foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Stuyvesant Town, there is a $3 billion first mortgage, or commercial mortgage-backed security, and a $1.4 billion second loan held by SL Green and others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, there is $1.9 billion in equity put up by Tishman Speyer, BlackRock and their investors. Tishman Speyer, which generally earns development and management fees from the properties, has about $56 million of its money in the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd say their equity has been wiped out,'' said Craig Leupold, president of Green Street Advisors, ''given the decline in apartment values.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By ALLEN SALKIN   </div><div>592 words</div><div>9 September 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multiple bidders have made offers on Bernard L. Madoff's Montauk beach house, and a buyer might be announced by the end of the week, a listing agent said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has been very busy,'' said Joan Hegner, an agent with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 3,000-square-foot oceanfront house on the dunes in Montauk went on the market for $8.75 million on Sept. 1, and 70 real estate brokers showed up for an open house two days later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the Labor Day weekend, there were 23 showings to potential buyers, Ms. Hegner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She declined to say how much was offered for the house, but the intense interest bodes well for the sale of other Madoff properties, including the Manhattan penthouse where Mr. Madoff was under house arrest, and a house in Palm Beach, Fla. Both of those properties could go on the market as soon as this week, said Roland Ubaldo, a deputy United States marshal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Marshals Service is overseeing the sales, and all proceeds are to go into a fund benefiting victims of Mr. Madoff's $65 billion Ponzi scheme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are putting the Madoff name aside and saying this is just a prime piece of property,'' Mr. Ubaldo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One potential buyer is flying in from Germany to see the house, and another is coming from Florida, Ms. Hegner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Madoff house, at 216 Old Montauk Highway, has attracted far more interest than other celebrity homes for sale on the east end of Long Island. Tower Hill, an 11-bedroom house in Bridgehampton owned by Christie Brinkley, has been on and off the market since 2002 and is now listed for $30 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Billy Joel, Ms. Brinkley's former husband, put two houses in Sagaponack on the market for a total of $35 million. And the actress Tuesday Weld lowered the asking price of her beachfront house in Montauk to $7.75 million, hoping to attract new interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the multiple offers show that the house where Mr. Madoff and his wife, Ruth, spent time is clearly the star property, even though potential buyers must provide a letter from a bank or another source verifying that they have the resources to purchase the home outright without a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ubaldo said the Marshals Service planned to chose an agent this week to sell the Upper East Side penthouse, where Mr. Madoff lived after confessing his scheme to authorities but before being sent to a medium-security prison in Butner, N.C., where he is serving a 150-year term. The agent who is chosen can list the property immediately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Montauk house sells for anywhere near the asking price, it will show that Mr. Madoff may have underestimated the value of his real estate holdings. When he valued the Montauk property, according to estimates filed last year by federal regulators, he said it was worth $3 million. Mr. Madoff put the penthouse at $7 million and the Florida home at $11 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ubaldo said it was up to the real estate agent to price the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are looking for market value,'' he said. ''We don't know what market value is. Our top priority is restitution to victims.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">In South Midtown, There Are Some Relative Bargains in Commercial Rent</span>
</div><div class="author">By J. ALEX TARQUINIO   </div><div>1110 words</div><div>9 September 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the midst of a sharp downturn for commercial real estate, vacancy rates have soared and asking rents have fallen in all of Manhattan's major office districts. But rents have fallen less steeply in Midtown South, which stretches roughly from 34th Street to Canal Street and includes a diverse mix of neighborhoods, including the Flatiron District, Chelsea and TriBeCa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midtown South is still a relative bargain by Manhattan standards. The average asking rent for Class A space is $51.13 a square foot annually in Midtown South, compared to $68.76 in Midtown, according to Colliers ABR, a commercial real estate services company. But the average asking rent for Class A space is now about 25 percent cheaper in Midtown South than it is in Midtown; a year ago, the discount was 33 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert L. Sammons, managing director in charge of research for the New York area for Colliers, said the main reason was old-fashioned supply and demand. To be sure, the office vacancy rate has risen in Midtown South, as it has across Manhattan. But there are so few large modern buildings in Midtown South to begin with that relatively little space is available even now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Midtown South covers a large swath of real estate, it has very little prime office space, which brokers refer to as ''Class A'' space. In fact, brokers consider fewer than two dozen of the office buildings in Midtown South to be Class A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the vacancy rate for Class A space is 7.3 percent in Midtown South versus 12.7 percent in Midtown, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, another major commercial real estate concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jared Horowitz, a senior director at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, said that in Midtown South, even the Class A buildings tend to have smaller floor plates than Class A buildings in other markets, and an arty look and feel. Although this might not be right for every tenant, he said, ''Midtown South is still a more economic alternative for tenants who want to stay in New York.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although office leasing activity has been slow all across Manhattan in the last year, a few large leases have been signed in Midtown South in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Gap signed a 20-year lease for 265,000 square feet on the 11th through the 16th floors at 40 Worth Street, between Church and West Broadway in TriBeCa. This is the largest office lease signed in Manhattan this year. Gap plans to move employees into the new site from space that it now leases at 620 Avenue of the Americas and 675 Avenue of the Americas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> signed a 10-year lease for 103,000 square feet on the 12th and 13th floors of the Empire State Building, which is at 350 Fifth Avenue, near 34th Street. In January, the F.D.I.C. will be moving all of its New York staff, some 230 employees, from space that it leases at 20 Exchange Place in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Rubino, the F.D.I.C.'s associate director for corporate services in the division of administration, said he had looked for new space in both Midtown and Midtown South, but not in Lower Manhattan. ''Our overriding desire was to get closer to the transportation hub, including Grand Central, Penn Station and the Port Authority,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of just how much the Manhattan office market has swung in favor of tenants, Mr. Rubino was given about two dozen proposals by landlords, he said. ''We received a very economic rate'' at the Empire State Building, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Empire State Building has a lot of empty space now, but that is largely by design, said Anthony E. Malkin, the president of the Wien &amp; Malkin Securities Corporation, which supervises the skyscraper on behalf of the owners: the Malkin family and the Helmsley estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building has traditionally been occupied by hundreds of small tenants, who tend to pay lower rents. But the landlord has not renewed the leases of many of these small tenants, so as to stitch together large blocks of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout this process, Mr. Malkin has to leave a lot of space vacant, which clearly reduces the amount of rent he collects in the short term. He said that around 45 percent of the 615,000 square feet of space that was now available directly from the landlord was being held in reserve until he could put together whole floors or half-floors. At the moment, five full floors are available: the sixth, 29th, 31st, 61st and 70th floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malkin said asking rents in the Empire State Building ranged from the high $40s to the low $60s per square foot, with the rents rising on the higher floors. He said the average rent paid by current tenants was $33, up from $26 three years ago, ''which means we still have a lot of tenants paying much less,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another major building renovation has put a large block of space on the market in Midtown South. The LL Holding Company, which owns 200 Fifth Avenue, a 15-story 850,000-square-foot building, has spent the last two years converting this former toy showroom to offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Grey Group, the global advertising company, plans to move in this November as the anchor tenant. Grey signed a lease for 340,000 square feet, from the seventh through the 14th floors, shortly after L &amp; L Holding purchased the building for $480 million in 2007. But then the recession struck, and no other office tenants have signed leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a gut renovation, the building, which sits opposite the Flatiron Building and Madison Square Park, has 57,000-square-foot floor plates. David W. Levinson, the chairman and chief executive of L &amp; L Holding, said these could easily be divided into 20,000-square-foot blocks. About 340,000 square feet is available: the entire second through sixth floors, and half of the seventh floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Levinson said that two years ago, when he began marketing the building, he was asking around $80 a square foot, but now it would be significantly less, although he would not be more specific. ''We're prepared to meet the market for a building of this quality,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding an apartment in Manhattan can be tough. Just ask the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year, dozens of New Yorkers in some of the city's wealthiest ZIP codes are set to be evicted to make way for the long-delayed Second Avenue subway, and federal law requires the transit agency to find them comparable new homes. So far, it has not been going so well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Zigerelli was told to consider low-income housing across from an on-ramp to the Queensboro Bridge. The first apartment shown to Nicolle Poian was half the size of her own. Ann and Conrad Riedi, ensconced in the same rent-stabilized apartment for 40 years, said they were encouraged to move out of Manhattan -- and their dog, Biscuit, might not be allowed to come along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They told us to think outside the box,'' said Ms. Riedi, 64.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Riedis' apartment, a big three-bedroom in a stucco-walled walk-up, is one of 60 homes on the Upper East Side that will soon be converted into ventilation shafts, public stairwells and electronics hubs, the infrastructure for the $4.5 billion underground line, scheduled to open in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transportation authority said that it was doing its best to accommodate residents who want to stay in the neighborhood, and that no one was being forced to leave the area. Affordable housing was suggested to residents who might be eligible, said a transportation authority spokesman, Kevin Ortiz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the options for tenants are limited. At first, Mr. Ortiz denied that the relocation service hired by the authority, a national real estate company called O. R. Colan Associates, had suggested that residents move outside their district, which stretches from East 59th Street to East 96th Street. Given an e-mail message showing that one tenant was encouraged to consider housing in Harlem, at East 116th Street, Mr. Ortiz said the authority wanted to offer as many choices as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're doing our due diligence,'' he said. In the case of the Harlem apartments, he added, ''No one seemed to be interested.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under federal law, the transit authority must find replacement housing deemed ''comparable,'' a phrase that officials have interpreted to mean an apartment of a similar size and rent, in the same neighborhood or nearby. If the tenant chooses a more expensive replacement, the authority must pay the difference in the rent for three and a half years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But New York's real estate market makes this an onerous task. Many of the residents live in rent-regulated units that cost far less than similar ones in the neighborhood. Rents could be an additional $1,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a situation was not anticipated by federal eminent domain law, which says the authority is obligated to pay each tenant up to $5,250 in subsidies over the three and a half years, a pittance on the Upper East Side. In a pamphlet distributed to tenants, a sample case involves a move from a $500-a-month apartment to a $600 one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authority said it planned to spend more than the required amount to assist the tenants. So far, the agency has had no problem finding rent-stabilized units in the area, said Mr. Ortiz, the spokesman. (O. R. Colan referred questions to the transportation authority.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some tenants have rejected those units, saying they did not live up to expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not exactly equivalent'' is how Ms. Poian, who pays $1,850 a month for a one-bedroom at 253 East 72nd Street, described the choices she was given. An apartment several blocks away was ''half the size'' of her own, she said, and the kitchen was about as big as a sidewalk square. ''They said I could find a different one for $1,800,'' she said. ''I said you're out of your mind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Shatzman, 23, moved last month from Ms. Poian's building, where he had lived in a studio for a little over a year. Although his moving expenses were covered by the transportation authority, he used his own broker after rejecting the options provided by O. R. Colan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They kept trying to show us low-income housing,'' Mr. Shatzman said. ''They kept trying to see if somehow we could come up with some numbers that would qualify it for us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sally Ardrey, who pays $1,600 a month for a one-bedroom at 257 East 72nd Street, said traditional measures of an apartment's fitness were being ignored. ''I was informed that light, view and big windows are not important,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Riedi, 76, has lived in the squat building at 83rd Street and Second Avenue since he was 12. When he and his wife married in 1969, they moved down one flight to a rent-regulated five-room apartment, now $1,120 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other tenants, the couple was urged by the relocation agents to consider moving to 250 East 60th Street, a housing development beneath the Roosevelt Island tramway. The building faces a traffic-clogged intersection at the entrance to the Queensboro Bridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Riedis balked, saying the location would be dangerous for elderly residents. They said their agent also suggested that, because of their fixed income and the limited rent subsidy, they should consider moving out of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants can find apartments through their own broker, but the relocation service must agree to the price based on a formula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Tenants are matched up with three units, based on what they can afford to pay and what their needs are,'' Mr. Ortiz said. ''We're not in any way, shape or form saying you have to do this, you have to move there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But tenants may be left with little choice. ''There are many rent-stabilized units on the Upper East Side and Yorkville, but the problem is people are already living in them,'' said Stephen Love, a broker at Ardor Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anticipating these problems, the authority approved a program in 2007 to rent vacant apartments and hold them for displaced tenants. That never happened, though the authority did spend more than $200,000 to rent empty units in the buildings it plans to acquire, to mitigate relocation costs and legal troubles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six tenants have already moved out, according to the authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after decades of living by the site of a long-planned subway line, the Riedis are not prepared to go just as the project comes to fruition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Riedi, her voice straining, said she and her husband had been scared since the eviction proceedings began. ''We were married in here,'' she said. ''We lost our first baby. We mourned the death of our child. There's history in this apartment. How do you take the memories?''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Posting article on Sept. 6 about new high-end residential developments on the eastern end of 14th Street in Manhattan overstated the improvements on the street made by Tishman Speyer Properties after it acquired Stuyvesant Town, the World War II-era housing complex. The supermarket on the 14th Street side of Stuyvesant Town already existed; it was not developed by the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Sep 20 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR decades, 14th Street seemed more boundary than destination, marking the northernmost limit of where dyed-in-the-wool downtowners socialized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, the street, a major crosstown thoroughfare that cinches Manhattan near its widest point, reinvented itself. In the meatpacking district, fashion boutiques colonized warehouses that once held sides of beef. In Union Square, gourmet groceries nuzzled a refurbished park. And throughout, new apartments went up, whether for dorms or longer-term housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the stretch bordering the East Village, east of Third Avenue, existed as a relative time capsule. Discount clothing stores still dot blocks as they did when the area was a popular middle-class shopping district, side by side with 100-year-old brick tenements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But stirrings of change are noticeable in the neighborhood, say brokers, business leaders and developers, many of whom are betting that renewal will continue its march along 14th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 19-story condominium rising at Third Avenue from the site of a former tanning salon may be a sign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a working name of 123 Third Avenue, the glass-and-aluminum tower will feature 48 one- to three-bedrooms, ranging from 515 to 2,300 square feet, according to Andrew Bradfield, a principal of Orange Management of Manhattan, a development partner. The other is F&amp;T Group, an international firm whose American office is in Flushing, Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The units will feature either 10- or 11-foot ceilings, and eight will have terraces. Residents will also be able to avail themselves of an outdoor movie screen in a ground-level garden that will connect by floating staircase to a second-story lounge and fitness center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A branch of <span class="companylink">Capital One</span> bank, meanwhile, has leased the building's 3,000-square-foot retail space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project, scheduled to be completed in the fall of 2010, is logistically complex, Mr. Bradfield said; it required the purchase of four parcels plus air rights. Noise from East 14th Street and Third Avenue, both of which carry two-way traffic, was countered by reducing the size of the windows and fitting them with sound-dampening panes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet despite the early departure of a private equity investor, financing has been less problematic; HSBC Bank will finance the project through completion, Mr. Bradfield said. He declined to disclose the project's total cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the housing downturn has had an effect. Even though the attorney general approved the offering plan in 2008, the sales office won't open till November, when more floors are up, since buyers now need ''to be convinced that a project's legit,'' Mr. Bradfield said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, the development team is tweaking prices. Initially, one-bedrooms were to start at $639,000, or about $1,200 a square foot, but under the revised offering plan, the same units will cost $515,000, or $1,000 a square foot, about a 17 percent discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If 123 Third is helping to blaze trails eastward, it seems to downplay its early-mover status. Indeed, the condo's marketing materials will emphasize its proximity to Union Square, Mr. Bradfield said, despite its actual East Village address, in a move that strikes some as disingenuous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a stretch,'' said Bertrand Buchin, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman who heads sales at Tempo, an under-construction condo on East 23rd Street at Second Avenue, that could pose competition for 123 Third, as its units start at $1,150 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're one and a half blocks away from Gramercy, but we wouldn't call this a Gramercy building,'' he said. Tempo's Web site, however, does refer to its being ''near the Gramercy Park area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But 123 Third is not the first high-end new condo to make a play for far East 14th Street. The A Building, from the Ascend Group, completed in 2008, has 25 feet of frontage between First Avenue and Avenue A, though its bulk is on East 13th Street. In addition, the earlier and much smaller Brownstone East Village added four units between Second and Third Avenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The street's incipient revitalization may also owe something to what's already there. In fact, the fresher look to the south-facing blocks between First Avenue and Avenue C comes courtesy of adjacent Stuyvesant Town. After Tishman Speyer Properties bought the World War II-era complex in 2006, it contributed new plantings, signage and a supermarket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other large-scale complexes could have a similarly transformative effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the Arun Bhatia Development Organization purchased 644 East 14th Street, at Avenue C, the site of a former car-parts store, for $12.3 million, according to city records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site, marketed for development, allows for stores and dozens of apartments, explained Joe Sitt, the Massey Knakal broker who handled the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, Mr. Sitt said, the nearby blocks, which hold mostly chain- and diner-variety eateries, have a way to go before they attract hip West 14th Street-style restaurants. But those typically follow new residences, and residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not about 'Build it and they will come,' '' he said. ''It's 'Put a roof over their heads and they will dine.' ''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LARCHMONT -- HIGH on a rock embankment at the edge of a private peninsula overlooking Long Island Sound here, an eight-bedroom home built in 1890 by Stanford White sits empty. No boats are moored at its dock. No curtains flutter at the windows. And the tides rise and fall without an owner to gaze from the house and marvel at the changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other properties up and down Westchester's 42 miles of eastern coastline, this one has a spectacular water view but a hefty price tag. At $14 million, it doesn't exactly have takers lining up at the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby, a five-bedroom home with a private beach and a gazebo overlooking the water is languishing at $15 million. In Rye, to the north, a four-bedroom contemporary on one and a half waterfront acres came on the market more than 16 months ago at almost $11 million; it is still for sale, but at $6.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contrary to what many real estate agents and their public relations agencies sometimes say, waterfront properties in the county are not doing very well, despite their great location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We try to be positive,'' said Jim Whittemore, the manager of the Larchmont office of Sotheby's International Real Estate. ''But sometimes that's hard to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line, according to Loretta Rapisardi, a broker for Sotheby's in Rye, is that ''nothing's bulletproof anymore.'' She added, ''Even though everyone's dream is to live on the water because it's like being on vacation all year round, the reality is that things are slow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Meyers, the chief operating officer of Houlihan Lawrence, which has offices throughout Westchester as well as in Putnam and Dutchess Counties, summed up sales for waterfront property this way: ''Somewhere in between holding up better than the rest of the market and just as bad as everything else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only occasionally do agents score a quick sale, he said, and that is usually to a buyer who has been watching and waiting in the wings for several years for a particular property to become available. In May, it took only 30 days for a five-bedroom home on a 0.75-acre lot in the Orienta Point section of Mamaroneck to sell for $4.27 million. ''It was the buyer's once-in-a-generation chance to get that house on the water,'' Mr. Meyers said, ''and he jumped on it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the number of sales over $4 million is down sharply in Westchester; there have been only eight so far this year. Of those, four were either on the water or in a waterfront neighborhood, Mr. Meyers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago from Jan. 1 through August, there were 27 sales in that range; of those six were on or near the water. The only good news is that when they do sell, waterfront properties get a quarter to a third more than inland properties, Mr. Meyers added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that many of the waterfront properties on the market last year are still for sale, and not many new ones have come on, Ms. Rapisardi of Sotheby's surmised that sellers are trying ''to wait out the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to her, there are currently 15 homes for sale, at prices ranging from $3.995 million to $22 million, along the waterfront in the northerly part of what is known as the Sound Shore area: Rye, Mamaroneck, Larchmont and Port Chester. The range starts lower in the southwesterly part of the Sound Shore in Pelham Manor and New Rochelle, which front a crook in the estuary formed by Long Island, to the south, and Connecticut to the north. Nothing is listed in Pelham Manor, but from New Rochelle northward, there are 10 homes, starting at $1.865 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on the market: five undeveloped parcels on the water, from $800,000 to $7.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the board, prices on waterfront properties have come down about 25 percent, which is unusual for that type of real estate, said Maureen Kirkpatrick, a Sotheby's sales agent in Rye. ''In previous downturns, waterfront has held its value,'' said Ms. Kirkpatrick, who has been selling real estate for 36 years. ''From a historical perspective, this is the worst I've ever seen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She linked the trend to Wall Street's problems, seeing them as having had an especially dampening effect on the high end of the market, with many financial executives no longer able to afford luxurious second-home properties on the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At the very least,'' she added, ''these properties are taking much longer to sell. In the glory days, a waterfront home would last no longer than three months in the $4 million to $12 million range. Now sellers have to be prepared for the long haul.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, a six-bedroom home on two waterfront acres in Larchmont has been listed at $22 million for almost 13 months. A new house that came on the market in Rye two and a half years ago at $16 million finally sold earlier this summer at $10 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even at less stratospheric heights, a three-bedroom town house at Milton Harbor House, a 121-unit co-op development on the water in Rye, was listed for $1 million two years ago and is now priced at $625,000. There still aren't any takers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the odds, at least one builder, Bobby Ben-Simon, is pursuing plans to build in Rye, on 2.6 waterfront acres that were once the site of a Boy Scout center. ''I'm ready to go, although I've made some adjustments in my numbers,'' said Mr. Ben-Simon, the president of KOS Building Group in Mamaroneck. Instead of the $15 million he expected to ask per house, he plans to ask about $9 million. ''I'm remaining optimistic,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, according to Ms. Kirkpatrick at Sotheby's, is because ''however bad the market is or isn't, waterfront is still magic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only problem is that most of the lookers now just can't bring themselves to bid.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BLOOMFIELD, N.J. -- NARCOTIZED by home magazines and infused with false confidence by months of exposure to HGTV, my husband, Craig, and I set out not long ago to sell our house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Checking out the ''comps'' just before our target date, I followed the bobbing balloons through the thicket of real estate signs into the bedrooms and baths of my neighbors, and I fell in love, like some suburban matron in an Updike novel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I fell in love with: a big mirror; a large, dark, clean-lined dining table; a shipshape red-and-blue kids' bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The allure of the costuming almost blinded me: to the master bath carved out of a closet, leaving no place for clothes, to the tiny finished basement with an ''office'' behind a striped curtain, to the kitchens fashionably clad in stainless but with hardly any counter space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having bought and sold four houses in the last 25 years, we were far from property virgins. Our plain and seemingly shrinking house had a great location near a county park; a new roof; two baths we had outfitted with powerful showers; a refurbished deck and basement; neutral paint; and a glossy top coat for the dark-stained wood floors. It looked crisp, spacious and tame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What special visual elixir would woo a buyer? A harmonious grouping of three cylinders of Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Pure-Castile Soap on the bath shelf? A golden bowl stacked with faux green apples in the kitchen?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps, but furniture was what it really needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trouble was, we had already moved most of that a mile away to Montclair, to our new place -- bought in August 2008, just days before the value of both houses collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new place was a 1960s brick-and-shingle Brady Bunch house tucked in among graceful older ones. We moved there only after we had owned it for more than six months and renovations were nearly complete. We did not feel we would have any luck selling the Bloomfield house until we had expunged every trace of ourselves, our five cats and our two small but extraordinarily well-equipped kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once in the new house, we talked strategy with the agent, Alan Erickson, then of First Mountain Realty. Would staging help? we asked. Anything, he counseled, to get the edge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We needed to choose our price at the last possible moment, to reflect the market, Alan added. Interest rates were falling, and he was optimistic, despite the competition and the Zillow e-mail messages on plummeting values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan called staging companies. For a bedroom, the dining room, the den and the living room for three months, the best estimate was $3,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig looked into simply renting furniture. He got an estimate of about $2,000, for some decidedly <span class="companylink">La-Z-Boy</span>-looking pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were squirming. We had taken one of the few financial risks of our lives at the worst possible time. ''You know,'' I said to Craig the night after our M.L.S. listing went up, ''I could stage the house for $1,000, and we could use everything we buy for the new place.'' He immediately saw this as a flimsy excuse for shopping, and he was partly right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, we scooped up the kids and tore over to Ikea. The idea, as formulated on the Garden State Parkway, was to stage the rooms that the estimates included, but buy only pieces we could also use in the new house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Ikea we split up, each pushing a cart with a child in it, taking notes with those stubby pencils, keeping in touch by cellphone and staging rendezvous to look at pieces together. The store closed at 10 p.m.; we didn't leave till 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not having a crew of photogenic experts to put it all together, we paid for delivery of the large pieces and assembly of the annoying ones. The next Monday, our baby sitter camped out at the empty house to supervise it all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the inducement of a gratuity, the workers even agreed to assemble the dark Leksvik drop-leaf dining table, as well as the confoundedly difficult white bead-board Hemnes daybed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After work, Craig screwed on the legs of an Ektorp love seat and oversized chair, and I wrestled them into their black-and-white slipcovers. Robert, the carpenter on the new house, came by to hang the heavy Mongstad mirror, a $99 cousin of the one I had fallen in love with earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We began adding things: dining chairs we had bought at the Door Store in Secaucus; cloth napkins from Ikea; gold-plated silverware from my aunt; a green wooden bowl for the kitchen; and some Steinmart vases, to hold whitewashed sticks with a vaguely HGTV flavor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Home Goods I found lamps, three little vases for an odd niche, and much more. That was the place where Craig and the kids, checking out a pet store, left me alone too long. By the time I reached the register, I had filled two carts. The cashier must have guessed what was up, and mentioned -- as the register tape spooled out -- that everything was returnable. The thought was comforting; we were getting close to $1,700 in total spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We then started shopping at home. Among the items we borrowed: a raised air bed for the master bedroom; a quilt to cover the bed; and various pillows to make it look cozier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before work on the day of the agents' open house, I was snipping armloads of the neighbors' forsythia where it poked through the fence, to fill an oversized ice-cube-shaped vase (Kanist) for the front window. Craig and I were zombie-weary and doubtful about the touches that had seemed so clever hours earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Was a book called ''Manless in Montclair'' on the newly whitewashed built-ins really going to amuse buyers? Was it craven to have removed my Buddha collection because of that TV admonition to depersonalize? Would someone sit on the artificially padded daybed and fall through the slats because we hadn't been able to afford the mattress?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At work I had to practically sit on my hands to keep from texting Alan. When I finally asked, he said he had heard ''nothing but positive comments'' from the agents. If the house had looked silly, I think he would have found a gentle way to tell us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We had more than a week until the public open house. Before then four offers came in, two in excess of the asking price of $394,715, and one a cash offer exceeding it by more than $50,000. We were stunned. Alan canceled the open house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cash offer had a sticky contingency: the buyer wanted us to wait until she had sold her house. It was paid off and under contract; inspection was pending. We said yes, with our own contingency, a $10,000 nonrefundable deposit so we could cover costs if the deal collapsed. Over the course of a six-week wait, the fear never left us that it might.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we were in the home stretch -- or, as Craig put it, ''days from having to cash in an IRA'' -- jeopardy loomed. Our buyer's buyer lost his job, so she would be seeking a mortgage, which would subject the house to the vagaries of an appraisal. We did fret -- but somehow a day later the sale was back to cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, in the Brady Bunch house, a Home Goods lamp casts its pool of light on my end of the office. The black-and-white loveseat and chair are in the basement playroom. The daybed, topped with two futons we had in storage, is in the guest room. It arrived without having to be reassembled. (That move, by the way, added $250 to our total.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll need to ask Robert the carpenter to hang the mirror, which is perfect for our living room. The table, which looked so lean, now seems bulky; it may yet end up on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What worked magic in the end? The staging? In Alan's view it helped -- but so did condition and proximity to the park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing is certain: The house never achieved its seductive potential until we moved out.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANY buyers today -- unsure whether prices have gone as low as they will go -- aren't looking for just a good deal. They're looking for a steal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For sellers, that means that to create even the slightest frisson to lure in buyers, they must either price their homes at distressingly low prices or present a property that is in turnkey condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if real estate values have started to level off, most buyers are still intent on paying rock-bottom prices. And once they have bought a place for a song, they are in no mood to spend a penny on remodeling. They want to do nothing more than unpack a toothbrush and move right in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This means, of course, that any apartment with a 1980s renovation or more than slightly worn countertops is destined for intense scrutiny and many weeks on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sellers are making the bold move of renovating their homes to sell them. Brokers say that this strategy can help keep the price out of the basement, and more important, help the home sell much more quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Renee Fishman, an agent with Halstead Property, first laid eyes on Rik Morris's two-bedroom apartment at 7 East 14th Street, the rooms were cluttered, the bathrooms were dated and the kitchen was ''unsightly, to say the least -- it was a little scary.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morris inherited the place last year from an aunt who had lived there for nearly 20 years and used the kitchen so rarely that she had the gas turned off ages ago. Ms. Fishman warned Mr. Morris that ''no one in this market wants an apartment that has great potential, but is in original condition, because nobody wants to do the work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morris, a private investor who lives with his partner, Jim Kelleher, in Philadelphia, resolved to fix up the place. ''Otherwise, we didn't think we would ever get what I considered a reasonable offer,'' he said. ''But I also wanted to make it so that if we didn't sell it, we would want to move into it ourselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six months and $147,000 later, they put the apartment on the market for $1.275 million. It had an expanded kitchen, new bathrooms, a new office area, a 42-inch plasma television, new doorways, refinished floors and freshly painted walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The men outfitted the place with contemporary furniture and used it briefly as a pied-a-terre. Three weeks after it went on the market, it sold, going into contract close to the asking price, TV included, in late July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wanted people to walk in and feel like they were walking into my home, not a unit that had just been painted and polished,'' Mr. Morris said. ''I'm not surprised at how quickly it sold, because we weren't selling a fixer-upper -- we were selling a finished product.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Fishman said that in its original condition, Mr. Morris would have been lucky to get $900,000, so she is sure that he recouped his investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buyers loved what they did to the place,'' she said. ''There's no question it made it 100 percent easier to sell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A search of listings in recent weeks produced several sellers who went well beyond clearing out clutter, deciding to pour thousands of dollars into renovating their homes before putting out a for-sale sign. The improvements ranged from refacing cabinets and installing new appliances to gut renovations of kitchens and bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the owners suspect they may lose money when they finally sell, but they are united in the conviction that the wait will be shorter than it would have been without the renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carroll Gardens Two-Bedroom</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meagan and Eric Newhart knew they would have to redo the kitchen before putting their two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn on the market. The cabinets were dated, and they were using a pair of pliers to turn on the dishwasher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their agent, Heather McMaster, a vice president at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, initially wasn't so sure. ''Why do a renovation when somebody might not like it?'' she said. ''But they're buyers themselves, and they felt it would move more quickly if it was priced well and didn't need anything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple are interested in a house in Westchester County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Newharts bought their Carroll Gardens co-op at 161 President Street two years ago for $599,000 and can imagine losing money on it, as they have just put it on the market for $625,000. The kitchen renovation, new dishwasher and all, cost about $20,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living through the project with their son, Zachary, 2, was not easy. Ms. Newhart and Zachary stayed at a friend's house during the day, but they went home to sleep. ''We did it because we wanted to make the apartment as marketable as possible,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hamilton Heights Town House</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emilio Frederick II and his brother, Malcolm, inherited a town house at 413 West 154th Street from their mother late last year. The top-floor apartment, where a cousin now lives, was in fairly good shape, but the rest of the house needed work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their mother had run a day care center on the ground floor. The brothers decided to present that floor as raw space. Then they turned their attention to the parlor and third floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't want to spend more than $30,000,'' Emilio Frederick said, ''but I thought it was very important to update the kitchen and get the carpentry done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The duplex still had original fireplaces as well as woodwork, much of it buried beneath decades of paint. So to bring back its 19th-century glory, the brothers had all the woodwork stripped and refinished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The kitchen harked back to the 1980s, so they replaced the white laminate with granite counters and hardwood cherry cabinets, and bought stainless-steel appliances. They also reglazed bathtubs and installed a vanity in one of the bathrooms. The work cost about $25,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After the renovations were complete,'' Emilio Frederick said, ''it was heartbreaking to put it on the market, because I would love to live in that house.'' Both men live in Maryland, though, and relocation is not an option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their broker, Doug Booth, an agent with Barak Realty, listed the house for $1.45 million last November, before the renovations were under way. Since late March, they have been able to market it with photographs of the renovated interior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Before the work was done, I was making apologies for it,'' Mr. Booth said. ''But it's a magnificent house, and it deserves to be shown without apologies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Booth is not too concerned about the property's time on the market because a steady stream of potential buyers has come through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously we would have liked this to have sold on the first day,'' he said, ''but it's a very slow town house market right now. The people who are looking at town houses are either people who normally wouldn't be able to buy a town house at all, or they're looking for extreme bargains. And this house, we feel, is priced just right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midtown Four-Bedroom</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Lewis, an executive vice president at Halstead Property, represents a brother and sister who are also trying to sell a home that they recently inherited. Their father, who died last year, left them a four-bedroom five-bath apartment at 135 East 54th Street that had been created by combining a studio with two apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither sibling lives in New York and both felt the space was too big to consider keeping as a pied-a-terre. But before they put it on the market, they decided to make it the showcase they knew it could be. They spent more than $100,000 to renovate and expand the kitchen, redo the master bath, refinish all the floors, and stage the place with rented furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most eye-catching work was the redesign of the foyer. They opened up the space and installed new lighting tocreate a gallery that announces that you have entered a gracious four-bedroom apartment, not a four-bedroom warren haphazardly created by combining units. They put the place on the market three months ago for $1.995 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lewis was pleased that the siblings made the investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that when the market was strong, it was rare to see executors put money into an estate sale. ''In a seller's market, the audience is hungry,'' he said. ''But now buyers don't want to dig into their pockets and do the work, unless it's in a hot, hot area that is impermeable to the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upper West Side One-Bedroom</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mariya Slonim and her husband, Vlad Rysin, listed their one-bedroom apartment at 214 Riverside Drive for $499,000 in May 2008. Their brokers, Alan Nickman and Stephen O'Neal, both executive vice presidents at Bellmarc Realty, knew it would be a hard sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple had planned on renovating, but put it off because they also wanted to combine the one-bedroom with an adjacent one-bedroom. But before they could put this plan into action, they left the city to work in Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Neal described the bathroom as having ''1980s brown Formica that was looks-like-wood ugly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a year on the market and several offers that fell through, Mr. Nickman told the sellers, ''People can't see this apartment for other than what it is, and the market is not on your side.'' He and Mr. O'Neal urged them to renovate, and the couple agreed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They put in a new kitchen and a new bathroom, refinished the floors and painted the walls in different colors with a faux stucco finish. The tab was about $60,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They listed the apartment again in late July for $529,000. Since then, their agents report, open houses have been busy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They didn't renovate the way a sponsor renovates,'' Mr. Nickman said. ''They did it as if they were going to move back into it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Slonim had her reasons. ''I wanted it to look nice, in case it did not sell and we would decide to keep it for another few years instead,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Neal said some buyers had confided that the walls weren't to their taste. ''The painting is a little personal to me,'' he said. ''I think I might have gone with a more neutral finish.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nickman said that he, too, would have recommended a more vanilla palette. ''You want what appeals to the largest possible crowd, to make it easiest for people to see themselves living there,'' he said. ''They did a good job, but it's to their taste and hopefully it will not be problematic.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT would be wrong to begin with anything but the beach. This tiny neighborhood, a mere four by eight blocks of the Rockaway peninsula in southern Queens, is bounded to the north by Jamaica Bay and to the south by the Atlantic Ocean. That proximity to the ocean defines Neponsit, from its blocks of waterfront mansions to the chummy neighborhood rituals that have sprung up to accommodate its beach-loving population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With street parking banned from May 15 to Sept. 30, owners of houses near the beach routinely make their driveways available to neighbors, who sometimes leave their car keys in case the homeowners have to run out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Robin Shapiro, an area real estate broker and 23-year resident, these rituals help to bind Neponsit's population in a contract of interdependent neighborliness. The contract is happy for the most part -- ''it helps keep us tight-knit,'' she says -- but there was the implication that resistance to it is not well tolerated. If, for example, a neighbor with an abundance of beachfront parking should choose to hoard it for himself, well, he would be doing so at his peril, Ms. Shapiro said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Area beaches have been in the news this summer: six people drowned there as of late August, most at night, after lifeguards had gone off duty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent sweltering Saturday, when the city had forbidden swimming because of tides, Neponsit's beach still drew many families, spread out on blankets to picnic and tan. The beach is public (it was owned by residents until the city bought it in 1939), and borders the one at Jacob Riis Park to the west. But unlike Neponsit, Riis Park offers paid parking, so it draws far more visitors. Neponsit's stretch of sand is largely left to its residents or outsiders with parking connections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We come out here all the time on weekends,'' said Karina Lubowitz, who with her husband, Aaron, and their three young children had set up for the day on a blanket strewn with tiny shovels and beach toys. The family lives in Westchester County, but Ms. Lubowitz grew up in Neponsit and her extended family still lives there, on Beach 147th Street. Mr. Lubowitz, an investment banker, shrugged when asked what there was to do in the area. ''There's really nothing to do,'' he said. ''If you're looking to get away, this is the place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was this mellow, isolated quality that attracted William Scholander, who any day now plans to move into a five-bedroom three-bath house at Beach 143rd Street and Cronston Avenue, which he bought for $865,000 -- ''an absolute steal for the neighborhood,'' as he put it. A Brooklyn native, Mr. Scholander, 32, had been living in Marine Park. He wanted an area that felt more remote, but that wouldn't add substantially to his commute to Wall Street, where he owns a securities brokerage firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm used to the busy life and fast pace and everything else,'' he said. ''When I go home, I want to relax and kick back. It's like a hideaway. It's not too far, it's not too close.'' For him, the beach was more of a bonus than a requirement. ''I love convenient things,'' he said of the beach's proximity to his new home, which he plans to repaint and resurface, in addition to installing new bathrooms and a new garage door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishermen routinely gather along Beach Channel Drive, not far from Mr. Scholander's new house; they lean their rods on the concrete barrier overlooking Jamaica Bay and the distant, misty silhouette of Manhattan. According to census data, the population is about 2,000; 95 percent are white, 2 percent Asian, 2 percent Hispanic, and fewer than 1 percent black or multiracial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in other Rockaway neighborhoods, Neponsit's numbered streets are preceded by the word ''beach'' -- the neighborhood runs from Beach 142nd Street to Beach 149th Street -- as if to compel enunciation of the word as much as possible. That reinforces what is already obvious, from the scent of salty air to the sight of beach-bound people in bathing suits, lugging chairs and surfboards along the sidewalks. And proximity to the beach has everything to do with real estate: walking north to south, a visitor may notice that the louder the waves, the grander the houses become.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neponsit is zoned only for residential use, though some other Rockaway neighborhoods offer the services and amenities it lacks. Locals cherish its residential nature along with the street parking ban, which lends its beaches an air of exclusivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anytime a pin drops in Neponsit, everybody knows about it,'' said City Councilman Eric Ulrich, whose district includes the neighborhood. He noted the ''wonderful block parties'' and said that compared with other parts of his district, Neponsit is ''fairly easy to represent'' -- a place defined by a high quality of life and few problems. A representative example: His office recently received requests to repair the high chain-link fence separating the Neponsit and Riis Park beaches. Holes have been cut, allowing passage between the beaches. ''It's minimal,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Neponsit Property Owners Association, a civic group, plants and tends trees and landscaping along malls on Rockaway Beach Boulevard and other neighborhood streets. Peter F. Sammon, the group's leader and a resident of more than 50 years, says the association collects voluntary annual dues of $50 -- $75 from those who live on beach blocks or along Rockaway Beach Boulevard, where tree and landscape upkeep is most costly and prominent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You pay a lot of money to live out here,'' said Lisa Jackson, a broker with Neponsit Realty. Two- to three-bedroom bungalows, she said, start in the low $600,000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices increase closer to the beach, where ''you're basically starting at $950,000 and up,'' said Annette Farina, the owner of Belle Harbor Realty, adding that a house at that price would most likely require work. (She said ''a lot of these Rockaway old-timers'' had never redone their kitchens or baths.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three- to four-bedroom houses not needing as much work start at $1.6 million, Ms. Farina said. But whatever the house size, anyone shopping on a beach block can expect to pay in the millions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have fallen about 4 percent from this time last year, according to Ms. Farina. Home sales take an average of five months, as opposed to two and a half months in 2008. In August, there were seven houses on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shapiro says summer house rentals are available; she cited a recent one on a beach block for $5,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial strips can be found along Beach 129th Street and near the Beach 116th Street subway stop. Still, Ms. Farina said, many items are available only outside the neighborhood. ''As a man, if you wanted to look for clothing or shoes, you wouldn't be able to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leisure activity is also limited, she said, citing a lack of movie theaters, bowling alleys and roller skating or ice skating rinks. ''A lot of people go out of the area for different things,'' she said. Residents are granted discounts on bridge tolls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jacob Riis Park, a Gateway National Recreation Area, has basketball, paddle tennis and volleyball courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local school district is also open to children in Far Rockaway and Ozone Park. Public School/Middle School 114 in adjacent Belle Harbor, on Cronston Avenue at Beach 134th Street, has an enrollment of 834 in kindergarten through Grade 8. A city quality review last year called it a ''safe, secure and harmonious school'' working to increase challenges for higher achievers. Last year, 99 percent of fourth graders met state standards in English and 99 percent in math, versus 69 and 85 citywide. Among eighth graders, 89 percent met standards in English and 90 percent in math, versus 57 and 71 citywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beach Channel High School, in Rockaway Park, enrolls 1,409 students in Grades 9 through 12. The school has struggled; a city review last year found that ''through the leadership, vision and resource management skills of its principal,'' it was showing improvement. SAT averages in 2009 were 403 in reading, 398 in math and 401 in writing, versus 435, 459 and 432 citywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neponsit is served by the QM16 express bus, which takes an hour and 15 minutes to get to Midtown Manhattan. There are also two local buses: the 35 and the 22. Neponsit does not have a subway station, but buses run to the Rockaway Park Shuttle, which connects to the A train.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York Water Taxi departs from Riis Landing, in nearby Breezy Point, taking riders to Bay Ridge and Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The street grid was laid out by the Neponsit Realty Company in 1910, according to the Encyclopedia of New York City. Hotels, stores and houses costing less than $3,000 were prohibited. A few houses became summer-only destinations, but Neponsit was designed for year-round living, unlike many other Rockaway neighborhoods.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THOUGH the price was right in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where the sisters Mariah and Dominique Freda shared a rental-- $2,050 a month for their two-bedroom -- nothing in the apartment worked very well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shower had a ''mind of its own,'' Dominique said. An attempt to turn the cold water slightly higher would result in an icy blast, or maybe a scalding one. In winter, there was insufficient heat. The wooden floor started to bubble and warp, and the deadbolt wouldn't stay screwed into the rotted door frame. It was hard to get anything fixed properly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By spring, the sisters saw rental prices dropping, but their landlord refused their request to reduce the rent by $100. ''We didn't feel we were getting our money's worth,'' Mariah said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they pounced when their father, Joe Freda, a builder in their hometown, Sea Isle City, N.J., suggested they hunt for a home to buy so they would no longer have to deal with difficult landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After graduating from Boston University, Mariah, now 26, moved first to Battery Park City with a roommate, then to Astoria, Queens, with a different roommate. Wanting her own place, she moved to a small Astoria studio, which had problems with heat and electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dominique, 24, graduated from Villanova University and Columbia University's Teachers College, where she lived in a dormitory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the spring of 2008, the sisters moved together to the rental in Park Slope, not far from the public school where Dominique was a student teacher. She now teaches fourth grade in Sunset Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mariah, formerly a nanny on the Upper East Side, is now enrolled at the New School for Drama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They aimed to find two bedrooms of the same size, preferably in a small building in Park Slope, for around $600,000. The problem was the bedrooms. Almost every place had a large master bedroom and a much smaller second bedroom. Such a setup seemed fine for families with children, but not for roommates or siblings, Mariah said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what they found at an otherwise lovely apartment on Garfield Place, where four buildings were joined and converted two decades ago to a condominium. The apartment, with nearly 1,000 square feet, had two bathrooms, but ''the bedrooms didn't quite work for us,'' Mariah said. It was also over their budget. (It remains for sale at $635,000.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A condominium building on Eighth Street was more affordable but had a similar bedroom problem. There, $575,000 bought a little less than 800 square feet and one bathroom. The sisters have different schedules, so sharing a bathroom was no problem, but their parents felt a second bathroom was better for resale purposes, Dominique said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sixth Street, they found what seemed to be their ideal home: a two-bedroom two-bath condominium of around 750 square feet. The listing price was $550,000. The apartment seemed far superior to the others, with basement storage and rooftop access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was a little bit of a difference in the size of the bedrooms,'' Dominique said, ''but not the extreme a lot of places had. We all got really excited about it.'' Their offer of $525,000 was accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they were frustrated by the bumpy buying process. ''I was getting phone calls at work where I had to immediately fax something,'' Dominique said. ''It seemed like it was end-all, be-all, and it had to be done that moment.'' Then, afterward, they would hear nothing for days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early summer, they intended to meet the developer at the condominium on Sixth Street, before leaving a deposit. Mr. Freda drove up from the Jersey Shore, planning to check out the building, partly because he was wary of new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He compared it to buying a new model of a car,'' Dominique said. ''You don't want to get the new model'' before the kinks are worked out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer never showed up. Something felt odd. The Fredas called off the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were pretty down, since we thought we were buying that weekend,'' and instead ''we're starting back at Square 1,'' Dominique said. They had already informed their landlord they were leaving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What now? ''I said, 'Keep your chin up, kids; go on the Internet,' '' Mr. Freda said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They found a new condo listing with potential, and Mr. Freda called the listing agent, Maxine Resnick of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>'s Park Slope office, to say his two daughters would be attending the day's open house, and if they liked the place, they would buy it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I took it with a grain of salt,'' Ms. Resnick said. But the sisters showed up with their mother, Marisa Freda, who happened to be visiting, and all were enthusiastic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 1,400 square feet, the apartment was much bigger than every other place they had seen, with two bedrooms of equal size and three bathrooms. A spiral staircase led to a large basement recreation room. The common charge and taxes were slightly less than $400 a month. The asking price in the spring had been $639,000, but the place was now listed at $599,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building dates from about 10 years ago, ''before the big real estate boom, so condos that predate the boom tended to give more square footage to the unit,'' said Cindy Whiteside, who works with Ms. Resnick at Corcoran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two agents had been having trouble of their own with the sale. Earlier, a buyer was about the sign a contract and even received an estimate for building a closet in one bedroom. But weeks of unexplained delays ensued. Finally, the agents stopped waiting and scheduled another open house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a lot of interest, Ms. Resnick said, with one couple wanting to return for a second look and someone else -- apparently an investor intending to rent the place out -- offering $25,000 above the asking price, ''a rare thing in this market,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Fredas made an offer that night, and they were able to pay all cash. They bought their apartment for the asking price and closed within the month. The sisters are using their father, who provided the money, as their mortgage lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two arrived a month ago. Dominique has the bedroom with no closet, but her father built a large wardrobe along with a shelving unit for shoes. All the appliances and utilities in their new home seem to be working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is so nice to know that you don't have to worry about a landlord,'' Dominique said. ''As a renter, if something breaks, there is only so much you can do to fix it without overstepping bounds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as an owner, ''it is yours to fix and you don't need to ask anyone's permission. I didn't realize how annoying a landlord is until I didn't have one anymore.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statewide Self Storage spreads out near Highway 4 in Antioch, Calif., a suburban community between San Francisco and Sacramento. It's a phalanx of long, low-slung buildings separated by wide driveways and lined with red doors. The complex houses 453 storage units and is wedged between a car dealership and a <span class="companylink">Costco</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the last afternoon in May, and the sun seared all the concrete and corrugated steel. Statewide's gate opened, and a man named Jimmy Sloan made for the far corner of the property. Sloan, who dresses and styles his hair like James Dean, is a part-owner of the <span class="companylink">Harley-Davidson</span> repair shop nearby. He rolled open the door of a 10-by-30-foot unit, the largest Statewide offers. It was his ex-fiancee's, but still leased under his name, and packed with, among other things, a particleboard shelving unit, some wicker items, a microwave oven, a box labeled ''Mickey's Hornet Neon,'' a floor lamp, a television and a wooden child's bed standing on its end on a desk. It was hard to tell how deep the inventory went. ''She hasn't seen most of this stuff in six years,'' Sloan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For five years, he stored most of it above the garage of his house. But he had to borrow on the house to keep the bike shop running, and last year, feeling in over his head, he opted to sell the house and downsize before he fell behind and risked foreclosure. ''Pretty much got out of that house at zero -- didn't make a penny on it,'' he told me with the kind of ascetic pride that wouldn't have made any sense before our economically crippled era. Sloan's fiancee insisted he rent a storage unit and move everything over the garage into it for her. So he did. Then they split up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He kept paying the rent on the unit for almost a year -- $217 every month. But Sloan finally lost his patience and told her: ''You know, we're not even together anymore. This stuff's gotta go.'' Everything here, he told me, was worth less than what he had paid to store it. ''Storage is always a bad investment, any way you look at it,'' he said. The rent was her responsibility now. But the former future Mrs. Jimmy Sloan never paid Statewide. By now, it seemed likely that the managers would end up auctioning off the contents of the unit in accordance with state law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was fine with Jimmy Sloan. But he wanted to get in first and make sure that his late father's collection of hunting knives and die-cast toy tractors, which he'd lost track of, weren't mixed in there. And so, to regain access, he'd just walked into the office and paid Statewide what was owed: $460. He'd counted out the cash unresentfully, like a man retrieving his dog from a neighbor's house for the 10th or 11th time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That stuff is Happy Meal junk,'' he now said, pointing to a see-through Rubbermaid bin in the storage unit's brickwork of boxes. It was full of brightly colored plastic toys and a pair of hot pink sunglasses that belonged to his ex-fiancee's children. ''The kids broke it, played with it once. It wasn't even for Christmas,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sloan had not started rummaging for his dad's knife and tractor collections in earnest: he was still pecking at the concretion's surface, not tunneling into it. But already he'd found a Marilyn Monroe poster and a souvenir road sign for James Dean Boulevard and set them near the door. They were his, from his old living room. He had forgotten about them and wanted to take them home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon, he peeled back the top of a huge bin. Inside, I could see a VHS cassette of ''American Pie'' and a black-and-white toy football with the logo of the Oakland Raiders. ''Look at that!'' Sloan said suddenly. ''A Raider football!'' He put it next to the poster and the road sign. Apparently it, too, was just appealing enough to hang on to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Self Storage Association, a nonprofit trade group, estimates that since the onset of the recession, occupancies at storage facilities nationwide are down, on average, about 2 or 3 percent. It's not a cataclysmic drop but enough to disorient an industry that has always considered itself recession-resistant, if not outright recession-proof -- so unstoppable that even having to engage in basic Marketing 101 stuff, like lowering prices, has struck some operators as a comedown. ''I feel so dirty,'' one manager wrote in the online forum of the trade magazine Inside Self-Storage. He had just started a promotion: a $20 move-in special. ''Now I need to go shower again,'' he added. A survey by BMO Capital Markets earlier this year showed that more than 80 percent of storage places nationwide were offering free rent for a month or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The down economy has clearly created circumstances in which some people desperately need to rent storage units -- namely, people losing their homes. But more significantly, it seems to be upsetting a longstanding equilibrium -- a kind of psycho-financial inertia that has kept so many tenants in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Human laziness has always been a big friend of self-storage operators,'' Derek Naylor, president of the consultant group Storage Marketing Solutions, told me. ''Because once they're in, nobody likes to spend all day moving their stuff out of storage. As long as they can afford it, and feel psychologically that they can afford it, they'll leave that stuff in there forever.'' Now, though, ''there are people who are watching their credit-card bills closer than before,'' he said. ''They're really paying attention to the stuff they're storing and realizing that it's probably not worth $100 a month to keep. So they just get rid of it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a monumental building boom, the United States now has 2.3 billion square feet of self-storage space. (The Self Storage Association notes that, with more than seven square feet for every man, woman and child, it's now ''physically possible that every American could stand -- all at the same time -- under the total canopy of self-storage roofing.'') According to the Self Storage Association, one out of every 10 households in the country rents a unit, making facilities like Statewide among our last national commons -- places where nearly every conceivable kind of American still goes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the collapsing economy created an opportunity, and in some cases an ultimatum, for Americans to reassess the raft of obligations and the loads of stuff we accumulated before things went wrong. We've been making difficult decisions, and for a lot of us, that has involved rolling up the door of a storage unit and carting property in or out. The storage industry's expansion in the first flush years of this decade was both enabled by, and helped enable, the extreme consumption that defined America then. The people coming through the gates now are defining who we will be when this turmoil is over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first modern self-storage facilities opened in the 1960s, and for two decades storage remained a low-profile industry, helping people muddle through what it terms ''life events.'' For the most part, storage units were meant to temporarily absorb the possessions of those in transition: moving, marrying or divorcing, or dealing with a death in the family. And the late 20th century turned out to be a golden age of life events in America, with peaking divorce rates and a rush of second- and third-home buying. At the same time, the first baby boomers were left to face down the caches of heirlooms and clutter in their parents' basements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by the end of the '90s, there seemed to be almost limitless, pent-up demand for storage around the country, more than life events readily explained. Storage was seen as an invincible investment and became the go-to solution for developers with awkward, leftover scraps of land. After an industry report found that Hawaii ranked among the states with the least amount of storage space in the nation, storage barons rushed in, almost doubling the available square footage there between 2004 and 2007. One man converted a network of caves on Oahu, used to house munitions during World War II, into a storage facility. (The caves are naturally climate-controlled, perfect for wine.) Around the United States, newcomers to the industry were building even against the advice of their expert consultants. ''We were cranking these things out at exponential rates,'' an industry veteran named Tom Litton told me. ''It was just nuts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Litton's parents owned one of the earliest storage facilities, in Tucson. He now has two of his own, both in California, and manages 23 others. Among the ones he built and has since sold is a stunning 1,000-unit glass-fronted complex in Antioch. It could pass for a small corporate headquarters and is one of seven storage facilities within five miles of Statewide in either direction along Highway 4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across America, from 2000 to 2005, upward of 3,000 self-storage facilities went up every year. Somehow, Americans managed to fill that brand-new empty space. In June, Public Storage, the industry's largest chain, reported that its 2,100 facilities in 38 states were, on average, still about 91 percent full. It raises a simple question: where was all that stuff before?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of it just comes down to the great American propensity toward accumulating stuff,'' Litton explained. Between 1970 and 2008, real disposable personal income per capita doubled, and by 2008 we were spending nearly all of it -- all but 2.7 percent -- each year. Meanwhile, the price of much of what we were buying plunged. Even by the early '90s, American families had, on average, twice as many possessions as they did 25 years earlier. By 2005, according to the Boston College sociologist Juliet B. Schor, the average consumer purchased one new piece of clothing every five and a half days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schor has been hacking intrepidly through the jumble of available data quantifying the last decade's consumption spree. Between 1998 and 2005, she found, the number of vacuum cleaners coming into the country every year more than doubled. The number of toasters, ovens and coffeemakers tripled. A 2006 U.C.L.A. study found middle-class families in Los Angeles ''battling a nearly universal overaccumulation of goods.'' Garages were clogged. Toys and outdoor furniture collected in the corners of backyards. ''The home-goods storage crisis has reached almost epic proportions,'' the authors of the study wrote. A new kind of customer was being propelled, hands full, into self-storage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of the expansion we experienced as an industry was people choosing to store,'' Litton told me. A Self Storage Association study showed that, by 2007, the once-quintessential client -- the family in the middle of a move, using storage to solve a short-term, logistical problem -- had lost its majority. Fifty percent of renters were now simply storing what wouldn't fit in their homes -- even though the size of the average American house had almost doubled in the previous 50 years, to 2,300 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider our national furniture habit. In an unpublished paper, Schor writes that ''anecdotal evidence suggests an 'Ikea effect.' '' We've spent more on furniture even as prices have dropped, thereby amassing more of it. The amount entering the United States from overseas doubled between 1998 and 2005, reaching some 650 million pieces a year. Comparing Schor's data with E.P.A. data on municipal solid waste shows that the rate at which we threw out old furniture rose about one-thirteenth as fast during roughly the same period. In other words, most of that new stuff -- and any older furniture it displaced -- is presumably still knocking around somewhere. In fact, some seven million American households now have at least one piece of furniture in their storage units. Furniture is the most commonly stored thing in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The marketing consultant Derek Naylor told me that people stockpile furniture while saving for bigger or second homes but then, in some cases, ''they don't want to clutter up their new home with all the things they have in storage.'' So they buy new, nicer things and keep paying to store the old ones anyway. Clem Tang, a spokesman for Public Storage, explains: ''You say, 'I paid $1,000 for this table a couple of years ago. I'm not getting rid of it, or selling it for 10 bucks at a garage sale. That's like throwing away $1,000.' '' It's not a surprising response in a society replacing things at such an accelerated rate -- this inability to see our last table as suddenly worthless, even though we've just been out shopping for a new one as though it were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My parents were Depression babies,'' Litton told me, ''and what they taught me was, it's the accumulation of things that defines you as an American, and to throw anything away was being wasteful.'' The self-storage industry reconciles these opposing values: paying for storage is, paradoxically, thrifty. ''That propensity toward consumption is what fueled the world's economy,'' Litton said. The self-storage industry almost had to expand; it grew along with the volume of container ships reaching our ports. (Some storage facilities I visited in California are, in fact, made of shipping containers, which became surplus goods themselves as our trade deficit grew.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2007, a full 15 percent of customers told the Self Storage Association they were storing items that they ''no longer need or want.'' It was the third-most-popular use for a unit and was projected to grow to 25 percent of renters the following year. The line between necessity and convenience -- between temporary life event and permanent lifestyle -- totally blurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of junk stored in our properties,'' Ronald L. Havner Jr., Public Storage's chief executive, told a symposium in New York in June. Walking through his company's facilities around the country, he explained, ''I've sometimes said that we could put a torch to this building and it would have zero effect on the local economy -- because that's how much junk is stored in our properties.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Havner added that he believed all of this ''non-economic use'' had been flushed out by the recession -- that the dips in occupancy industrywide could be attributed to these customers' wising up and leaving. But really, there's no way of knowing exactly who is still out there, what they've got locked up and how they feel about it -- and, more important, how those complicated feelings might change if the psychology of the American consumer is substantially reshaped in a recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Litton, for example, still keeps four storage units himself, at two facilities, all of them 10-by-30 units. I asked what's inside. ''I have a canoe, I have a vending machine, I have a drill press,'' Litton began. His old lawn mower was in one. (He got a bigger, riding lawn mower when he bought a ranch in wine country.) ''I've got some of my old clothes that I probably wouldn't wear anyway,'' he continued, and some trophies from college. ''I also have some old cassette tapes that I produced.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cassettes are like audiobooks, he explained -- tutorials on how to get into the storage industry and succeed. He made them before the storage-facility building boom ended a couple of years ago. ''They didn't sell,'' Litton said, ''so they're all in storage now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One afternoon in late May, a woman slouched inside one of Statewide's narrow hallways, reorganizing the innards of her unit. She said her name was Elizabeth -- no last name given, since, as she told me, ''this is not a high-self-esteem moment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most everything here belonged to Elizabeth's parents, who entered assisted living last year, and she needed to clear it out to cut expenses. She was keeping an eye out for particular family memorabilia, but otherwise it was a long, beleaguering purge. ''Just stuff? Like my mother's kitchen stuff?'' she told me. ''Whatever.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boxed haphazardly inside the closet-size space was, as she put it, 53 years of married life. An empty pill bottle and an egg carton lingered on the little bit of visible floor space. ''I got rid of all the furniture,'' Elizabeth said, except her own drafting table, which, she pointed out, had wound up against the rear wall. She was an architect, accomplished but out of work (''Architecture is dead, dead, dead, dead,'' she explained) and was attacking this project with a conspicuously architect-ish methodology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had brought with her dozens of new, perfectly uniform white boxes, each bearing the Harry Potter logo in one of several colors. They lined the hallway behind her, still flattened. ''When the books come out, there's just hundreds and hundreds of these boxes at every bookstore,'' she said. ''I just went around and got them.'' She repacked and erected a tidy column of Harry Potter boxes in one corner of the unit. She turned a few others, tops folded inward, into a kind of bookshelf. ''This was when 'The Half-Blood Prince' came out,'' Elizabeth said. ''They stack really nicely.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was going to transfer these boxes, full of the few things worth saving, into a storage unit she recently rented in a nearby town. That unit housed most of what Elizabeth owned. Forced to leave her parents' old house and unable to afford a place of her own, she had moved in with a friend about eight months ago. As far as the storage industry was concerned, then, all the contemporaneous chaos of Elizabeth's and her parents' lives ultimately amounted to a wash: one old unit was being vacated, one new one was being rented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, since last year, owners around the country have reported quickening rates of both move-outs and move-ins, making any occupancy rate -- the industry's fundamental yardstick -- feel kind of arbitrary, like the momentary averaging-out of a blur of activity, with no single, dominant trend (or maybe even logic) behind it. At Statewide, for example, those like Elizabeth renting smaller units -- traditionally the backbone of the business -- have been steadily leaving. ''All I hear is, 'I can't afford it anymore,' '' says Joe Dopart, who manages Statewide along with his daughter Amy and his wife, Evie, a retired schoolteacher. Renters tell the Doparts they'll find a relative's garage in which to keep their yearbooks, winter clothes or extra mattresses. Or they dump what they don't need and downsize into a smaller, cheaper unit. (''To me,'' Dopart told me, lowering his voice, ''most of the stuff is just junk.'') At the same time, though, Statewide's larger units -- mostly empty for years -- are now completely full. ''Every single one, practically, has a foreclosure in it,'' Amy told me. Others were being rented by endangered businesses, like a coffee shop and a tea room whose owners were forced to shutter their storefronts in Antioch's struggling historic downtown and move everything into storage while they plotted their next moves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot, while this traffic runs both ways in the background, is that Statewide has remained about 88 percent full -- about two or three points lower than last summer, right in line with the national estimate. But that may obscure a more meaningful shift. By shaking up the composition of renters, and their reasons for renting, the recession could be quietly tilting the character of American storage closer to what it was originally: a pragmatic solution to a sudden loss of space, rather than a convenient way of dealing with, or putting off dealing with, an excess of stuff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, some people don't fit entirely into one category or the other. Brad Molakides, who wound up with a mortgage on a three-bedroom house he never could have afforded, had just handed back his keys when I found him unloading a rental truck at Statewide not too long ago. Molakides, a fast-talking man with longish white hair who installs wireless equipment for <span class="companylink">Alcatel-Lucent</span>, had vacated the house hastily and was now dealing with his last random, ungainly assets. He had spilled over into a second 10-by-10 unit, and it was stocked mostly with tools in giant metal carts. Far behind those, rubber garbage cans were stacked two-high. Those, Molakides told me, were his recyclables. ''I got plastic bottles in one, and the other is aluminum cans.'' They had collected in his backyard and he had never gotten around to redeeming them for the deposits. Now they would be marooned in the very rear of his storage unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I found people who had been foreclosed on at most of the storage places I hung around at, and I met many more who were forced to walk away from places they were renting. Among them were two teenage brothers, Luis Jaramillo and Nikolas Aceves, in the city of Stockton, an hour from Sacramento, whose family was about to scatter to relatives' houses in surrounding towns. And Jason Williams, a 38-year-old father of three who was filling a unit with furniture before he and his family moved in with his stepmother. Williams's wages at a commercial printing house had just been cut; one of the plant's four presses had been dedicated, virtually 24/7, to printing <span class="companylink">Circuit City</span> circulars before the retailer's bankruptcy, he explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one of my first mornings at Statewide, Evie Dopart introduced me to Danielle Johnson, who resembled a spunkier, smaller Demi Moore and who pulled her rent from a purse shaped like an old-school Nintendo controller. ''She's our most beautiful customer,'' Evie gushed, yentalike, after Johnson walked through the office door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johnson worked at <span class="companylink">Dollar Tree</span> and was also studying criminal justice. After her husband left to serve in Iraq, she couldn't afford the rent on their house in Oakland. So she locked everything but her clothes and schoolbooks in storage and moved in with her grandma. ''It's O.K.,'' she assured me, ''I'll get another one someday.'' She meant another house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a year ago. Her husband was now stationed in Kentucky, but if Johnson pulled out of school to join him, she would have to repay her student loans immediately and would end up with nothing. ''Well,'' she told me, ''I'm just going to finish, and I'll have my degree. He can wait.'' She seemed incapable of not putting a good face on the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Actually,'' she told me and Evie, ''it's kind of cool living with Grandma. Home-cooked meals are awesome, and no one makes them like Grandma does.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Your family's Italian, right?'' Evie asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No, we're redneck, though,'' Johnson said with a big smile. ''And I mean rednecks make some really good food. Gosh! My grandma's biscuits and gravy are screaming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virtually no one I asked, at any level of the business, took seriously the idea that this recession would produce a sea change in who uses self-storage and why. In an industry whose freewheeling success has been so closely tied to the evolving character and prosperity of our society, it can be hard to even talk about storage's future without getting philosophical or patriotic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I really think there's a spirit that things will turn around,'' Jim Chiswell, a Virginia-based consultant to the industry, told me. ''I believe that my children -- and both my children are proving it already -- they're going to have more at the end of their lifetimes, and more success, than I've had. And so will their children. I don't believe the destiny of this country as a beacon of freedom and hope is over. And I believe there will be more growth, and more people wanting to have things and collect things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Litton put it another way: ''The good news is that your age group'' -- I'm 31 -- ''has the same propensity for accumulating crap that I have. You guys got introduced to it in college, and you actually think you really need storage. You see storage the way that we all see cable and Internet access.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is, there is no typical storage customer. As facilities crowded into the landscape, storage units became incubators for small businesses and artisans; warehouses for pharmaceutical reps, <span class="companylink">eBay</span> merchants or landscapers. One unit at Statewide, the Doparts told me, functions as a kind of regional distribution center for Little Debbie cakes. I met a few homeless renters, who sometimes choose to pay to put a roof over their possessions instead of their own heads (living in units is not allowed); I met working-class renters using units as closets and safe-deposit boxes while serially couch-surfing or living in multifamily homes. I heard of a martial-arts instructor in Hawaii who trained clients in his unit, and a group of husbands in New England who watch sports in one on weekends. More than one operator told me they have a unit where, every morning, the renter goes in dressed as a man and comes out as a woman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe the recession really is making American consumers serious about scaling back, about decluttering and de-leveraging. But there are upward of 51,000 storage facilities across this country -- more than seven times the number of <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>. Storage is part of our national infrastructure now. And all it is, is empty space: something Americans have always colonized and capitalized on in good times, and retreated into to regroup when things soured. It's tough to imagine a product more malleable to whatever turns our individual life stories take, wherever we're collectively heading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But where are we now? Of all the storage units I toured, one sticks out as being most emblematic of this particular moment. It belonged to Terry Wallace, a 59-year-old veteran with white streaks in his hair and a broad, shaggy moustache who, when I stumbled across his 10-by-30 at a Storage PRO in Stockton, was sitting in a leather office chair, working at his desk under the open door, like a notary in a storefront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some open mail and a Herman Wouk novel were pushed aside, and the desk was covered with stacks of quarters, the ones celebrating the 50 states. Wallace was sorting them, state by state, into empty prescription-pill bottles. ''I've got 'em all,'' he said, astounded. ''I've got all 50.'' Then he invited me in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A folded-up Nordic Track leaned against the desk, and a bucket of fire axes sat behind him. (After serving as a helicopter mechanic in Vietnam, Wallace worked as a back-country firefighter in Yosemite.) But otherwise, the unit looked warehouselike. Stacked, labeled boxes stretched down either side of the deep, rectangular space with a snug but passable aisle between.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was everything Wallace owned, except the truck parked outside. A year ago, he was living in an apartment in Carson City, Nev., funneling the entire $1,200 he collected in retirement benefits and disability directly into his rent and alimony payments every month. ''So I started doing a lot of credit-card stuff,'' he said. Soon he was $30,000 in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wallace hated living in a city anyway, ''so because of my debt crisis and my marriage crisis and everything, I moved everything into storage and I just live out of my truck,'' he told me, resting his hands on his gut. That was June 15, 2008. At first, he rented a second unit across the way and spent a few months sorting, giving away items he didn't need to an organization for homeless veterans. ''You can call me homeless,'' he told me. ''But I'm not goofing around. I've got money, but I just want to get this debt down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was like a cleansing: the storage unit cost about $200 a month. But aside from gas, truck payments and food (he had several boxes of meals-ready-to-eat stocked here), it was his only major expense. He had cut out rent, cable, phone and electricity, and purged all the unnecessary fees from his bank statements. For the last year, he had been camping a lot and driving around the West visiting ex-firefighter friends. He saw a woman in Antioch occasionally. ''It's feeling good,'' he said, ''and it's working. That's the thing: it's working. Debts are down to almost zippo right now.'' He figured he'd be done by Thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a decade at least, storage has been a mechanism allowing Americans to live beyond our means. Wallace was using his unit as a center of gravity, to pull his financial life back within reach. He had even started saving, he told me, and was looking into a small condo in a suburb near Lake Tahoe. ''It's not my style or anything,'' he said; he'd prefer something more secluded -- bigger, and with land. ''But I could do that.'' He missed sleeping in his own bed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also missed his music collection -- and the books and rare coins he had collected. Also, his pins. ''Little pins, like flag pins,'' he explained. ''I've got veterans pins, and I've got Rose Parade pins, and pins that I got at fairs.'' He missed his stuff. ''Hey,'' he said as I left. ''I'll call you when I'm getting ready to load the truck.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montauk, N.Y. -- THE hottest spot in the Hamptons this Labor Day weekend is not the Ditch Plains surf break or the Blue Parrot restaurant, whose celebrity owners include Renee Zellweger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is Bernard L. Madoff's beach house. As news spread in recent days that the 3,000-square-foot house on the dunes in Montauk that belonged to Mr. Madoff is up for sale for $8.75 million, it became the toughest place to get into since the Surf Lodge opened a Champagne-and-espadrilles bar last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States Marshals Service, which is overseeing the sale of the house to benefit victims of Mr. Madoff's $65 billion Ponzi scheme, has gamely taken on the role of real estate promoter. A marshal in a blue windbreaker offers a videotaped tour that was released to the news media during which he extols, in a ''just the facts, ma'am'' monotone, the property's ''panoramic ocean view,'' and the master bedroom with an exercise bike, ''where Bernard and Ruth Madoff lived when they were here in Montauk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Marshals Service announced on Sept. 1 that the property would be shown by a local office of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, the phones of the husband-and-wife agents with the listing, Joan and Raymond Hegner, have been buzzing frantically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Callers are told straight up that they must present a bank letter stating they are qualified to pay cash because the Marshals Service will not allow financing, Ms. Hegner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many tours have been scheduled, she added. And it has been difficult to keep away the merely curious. Yellow police tape across the driveway to the home was yanked aside and left hanging on a tree. The address, 216 Old Montauk Highway, was publicized and is on a mailbox on the highway. But the house, a rather plain-looking gray and white contemporary with a spectacular ocean view, is not visible from the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A padlock was placed on the gate across the short walkway to the house from the beach after passers-by kept intruding. The real estate agents plan to install a chain across the driveway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am getting a frenzy of people looking at it,'' Ms. Hegner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday morning, she led one of her first showings, for a husband and wife with Russian accents who had two young men in tow. All declined to give their names to a reporter. The group walked past boxes with F.B.I. tags and inventories listed on them (''12 'Town' Mugs,'' ''8 pillows'') and, on a bedroom wall, an American flag made of wood slats bound with chicken wire. The furniture and property in the house is to be sold at auction, the Marshals Service has said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one personal item that had not been tagged or boxed was a half-full bottle of Redken Clear Moisture conditioner, on a ledge in the outdoor shower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The husband with the Russian accent walked with Ms. Hegner out to the front deck, where on one side is a small swimming pool. ''Put us in for $7 million,'' the man said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside, his wife confided: ''I don't know what he's doing. We live in a house twice this size with a nice view. We're going to come here with kids, two dogs, everything else?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The man eventually followed his wife in and declared, ''My son, he likes the pool.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hegner later said that the man, an old client of hers, had only been kidding when he made his offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next day, Thursday, the Hegners held an open house for other brokers. Dozens parked their cars along the narrow highway. They were let into the house in small groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The setting is spectacular and it's well priced,'' said one, Phelan Wolf, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens in Amagansett.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the house's notoriety will enhance or detract from a sale was a matter of much debate. Mr. Madoff, 71, was sentenced to 150 years in prison in June for defrauding thousands of victims in his decades-long financial fraud. The government plans to sell other properties that he and his wife, Ruth, once occupied, including a house in Palm Beach, Fla., and an apartment on East 64th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Onlookers gathered on the normally quiet beach of the Montauk property, which is far from public access points and a 10-minute walk from the nearest hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're not going to get 7, not in this environment,'' said Syl Catalanello, who said he sells commercial real estate in western Long Island. ''If they get 5.5, they should take the money and run.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vincent Irizarry, an actor on the soap opera ''All My Children,'' who was in Montauk to celebrate his mother's birthday, spoke with a fellow onlooker, Rachael Horovitz, a film producer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're selling stuff, I hear,'' Mr. Irizarry said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm curious to see her shoes,'' Ms. Horovitz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd like to buy his shoes, glue them to a canvas, say something artistically about the man who walked in those shoes,'' Mr. Irizarry replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A potential buyer in a bright green shirt stepped out of a sliding screen door onto the deck. He gazed at the ocean, but then spotted the onlookers and appeared to retreat back inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hegner said she did not worry that all the looky-loos and news media attention would discourage buyers. ''It's a temporary curiosity because of it being in the media outlets right now,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conventional 6 percent commission on an $8 million house would be $480,000, split between the broker who lists the house and the broker who brings the buyer. Those brokers, in turn, split their shares with the companies they work for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> and the Hegners are donating their shares of the listing commission to the fund for reimbursing Mr. Madoff's victims, said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of Corcoran. Although Corcoran will also donate its additional share if one of its brokers sells the house, the selling agent may keep his or her share, Ms. Liebman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Friday, there were at least five showings scheduled, two to potential buyers returning for a second look. Ms. Hegner was frantically trying to catch her breath and schedule weekend showings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as not everyone enjoys the hubbub of the Surf Lodge in downtown Montauk, not everyone on the beach understood what the fuss was about over an empty house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Willa Safferstein, 15, and Ali Janicki, 16, both from Westchester County, N.Y., said they had never heard of Mr. Madoff. Ms. Janicki prodded the shell of a horseshoe crab with a stick of driftwood, smiling as the tide washed it away. ''We're on vacation,'' she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credits for two charts with an article in some editions on Sept. 4 about campaign spending by the four Democratic candidates for New York City comptroller misidentified the source of the data. It was from the New York City Campaign Finance Board, not the City Board of Elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Tue Sep 15 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are four little-known candidates, but television viewers are likely to become quite familiar with them in the coming days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melinda R. Katz, David Yassky, John C. Liu and David I. Weprin, the four Democratic candidates for city comptroller, have raised a record total of $10 million for their campaigns and have the bulk of it on hand to bombard the airwaves with ads in an effort to break from the pack before the Sept. 15 primary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time there was a competitive race for the office, in 2001, William C. Thompson Jr. and his opponent, Herbert E. Berman, raised less than half of that amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money, always a key tool, is particularly important in this contest because three of the four candidates, all of whom are members of the City Council, are locked in a dead heat, a poll indicates. If no candidate receives more than 40 percent of the primary vote, the top two will face a runoff election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The money is crucial to them,'' said Micheline Blum, the director of survey research at Baruch College. ''None of them is that well known, and they need the money to get the message out and get the people out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Quinnipiac University poll on Aug. 26 found 45 percent of voters were still undecided. Three candidates, Mr. Liu, Mr. Yassky and Ms. Katz, were clustered around 16 percent with Mr. Weprin lagging behind at 5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaigns are scheduled to release their latest finance filings on Friday, but they have all said that they expect to have significant funds in the cupboard. Mr. Liu, who has collected the most in private contributions so far, $3.2 million, had $2.5 million on hand as of his last filing, on Aug. 14. Mr. Yassky, who has raised the least privately, $2.1 million, has received the most public matching funds and still had $2.2 million on hand at that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weprin and Ms. Katz each had about $1.6 million left to spend at a time when 30-second television spots are costing between $5,000 and $7,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each candidate has had success raising money from distinct groups, most notably Mr. Liu, who, if he were to win, would be the first Asian-American elected to citywide office. He has raised more than $2 million from Asian-Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than two-thirds of his money has come from donors who live outside the city. Such contributions are not eligible for the city's matching funds program, under which each dollar in a private contribution of up to $175 is matched by $6 in public money. As a result, though Mr. Liu has raised the most in private contributions, the $1 million he has collected in matching funds is second to the $1.3 million in matching funds collected by Mr. Yassky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yassky, a lawyer and law professor, did particularly well in raising money from other lawyers, who accounted for nearly $400,000 of his total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate developers, among the most reliable sources of campaign money for city candidates, supported all four, but none as much as Ms. Katz, who, as a chairwoman of the Council's Committee on Land Use, holds sway over the fate of real estate developments that require a zoning change. She collected more than $700,000 of her nearly $2.5 million total in private contributions from real estate development interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for her campaign said that Ms. Katz had won the respect of many real estate developers, even as she fought with them over affordable housing and limiting projects in overdeveloped neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One point that distinguishes this election from previous races for comptroller is the relative lack of cash from firms that manage money for the city's $80 billion employee pension system, which is overseen by the comptroller. Mr. Thompson had collected considerable campaign contributions over the years from money managers associated with the pension system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But under recent reforms, contributions from executives of firms that do business with the city, including those that manage money for the pensions, are now capped at $400, compared with $4,950 for others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Mr. Weprin lagged behind in the Quinnipiac poll, the $1.6 million he has on hand makes him still viable, given that the race is widely expected to wind up in a runoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Republican candidate, Joseph A. Mendola, who does not face a primary, has raised $14,600 so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get-out-the-vote efforts are also expected to be crucial, since the Democratic primary for the mayor's race, between Mr. Thompson and City Councilman Tony Avella, is not expected to produce a large turnout. Will enough Asian-American voters turn out to put Mr. Liu over the top? Can Ms. Katz gain an advantage as the only woman in the race?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Honestly, if you're not a political junkie, do you even know what's going on in this race?'' asked Ms. Blum, the director of survey research at Baruch. ''This office never gets that much attention, and it's even more difficult when you have so many candidates.''</p>

Amounts are adjusted to 2009 dollars.(Source: N.Y.C. Board of Elections); Comptroller Primary Spending: The four major Democratic candidates for comptroller have spent millions, and still had plenty left as of the Aug. 14 reporting date.(Source: N.Y.C.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HUNTSVILLE, Tex. -- AMONG the traditional brick and clapboard structures that line the streets of this sleepy East Texas town, 70 miles north of Houston, a few houses stand out: their roofs are made of license plates, and their windows of crystal platters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are the creations of Dan Phillips, 64, who has had an astonishingly varied life, working as an intelligence officer in the Army, a college dance instructor, an antiques dealer and a syndicated cryptogram puzzle maker. About 12 years ago, Mr. Phillips began his latest career: building low-income housing out of trash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1997 Mr. Phillips mortgaged his house to start his construction company, Phoenix Commotion. ''Look at kids playing with blocks,'' he said. ''I think it's in everyone's DNA to want to be a builder.'' Moreover, he said, he was disturbed by the irony of landfills choked with building materials and yet a lack of affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To him, almost anything discarded and durable is potential building material. Standing in one of his houses and pointing to a colorful, zigzag-patterned ceiling he made out of thousands of picture frame corners, Mr. Phillips said, ''A frame shop was getting rid of old samples, and I was there waiting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, he has built 14 homes in Huntsville, which is his hometown, on lots either purchased or received as a donation. A self-taught carpenter, electrician and plumber, Mr. Phillips said 80 percent of the materials are salvaged from other construction projects, hauled out of trash heaps or just picked up from the side of the road. ''You can't defy the laws of physics or building codes,'' he said, ''but beyond that, the possibilities are endless.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the homes are intended for low-income individuals, some of the original buyers could not hold on to them. To Mr. Phillips's disappointment, half of the homes he has built have been lost to foreclosure -- the payments ranged from $99 to $300 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those people simply disappeared, leaving the properties distressingly dirty and in disrepair. ''You can put someone in a new home but you can't give them a new mindset,'' Mr. Phillips said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the homes have resold quickly to more-affluent buyers, Mr. Phillips remains fervently committed to his vision of building for low-income people. ''I think mobile homes are a blight on the planet,'' he said. ''Attractive, affordable housing is possible and I'm out to prove it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freed by necessity from what he calls the ''tyranny of the two-by-four and four-by-eight,'' common sizes for studs and sheets of plywood, respectively, Mr. Phillips makes use of end cuts discarded by other builders -- he nails them together into sturdy and visually interesting grids. He also makes use of mismatched bricks, shards of ceramic tiles, shattered mirrors, bottle butts, wine corks, old DVDs and even bones from nearby cattle yards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't matter if you don't have a complete set of anything because repetition creates pattern, repetition creates pattern, repetition creates pattern,'' said Mr. Phillips, who is slight and sinewy with a long gray ponytail and bushy mustache. He grips the armrests of his chair when he talks as if his latent energy might otherwise catapult him out of his seat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix Commotion homes meet local building codes and Mr. Phillips frequently consults with professional engineers, electricians and plumbers to make sure his designs, layouts and workmanship are sound. Marsha Phillips, his wife of 40 years and a former high school art teacher, vets his plans for aesthetics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He doesn't have to redo things often,'' said Robert McCaffety, a local master electrician who occasionally inspects Mr. Phillips's wiring. ''He does everything in a very neat and well thought-out manner.'' Describing Huntsville as a ''fairly conservative town,'' Mr. McCaffety said, ''There are people who think his houses are pretty whacked out but, by and large, people support what he does and think it's beneficial to the community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, city officials worked closely with Mr. Phillips in 2004 to set up a recycled building materials warehouse where builders, demolition crews and building product manufacturers can drop off items rather than throwing them in a landfill. There's no dumping fee and donations are tax deductible because the materials are used exclusively by charitable groups or for low-income housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been recycling all my life, and it never occurred to me to recycle a door,'' said Esther Herklotz, Huntsville's superintendent of solid waste. ''Dan has changed the way we do things around here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials in Houston also consulted with Mr. Phillips before opening a similar warehouse this summer, and other cities, including Bryan, Tex.; Denham Springs, La.; and Indianapolis have contacted him to inquire how to do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix Commotion employs five minimum-wage construction workers but Mr. Phillips also requires the labor of the home's eventual resident -- he tends to favor a poor, single mother because his own father walked out on him and his mother when he was 17, which left them in a tough financial situation. ''My only requirement is that they have good credit or no credit but not bad credit,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his houses belongs to Gloria Rivera, a cashier at a doughnut shop, who built the home with Mr. Phillips and her teenage son in 2004. Before then, she lived in a rented mobile home. Constructed almost entirely out of salvaged and donated materials, the 600-square-foot wooden house is painted royal blue with various squares of red, maroon and fuchsia tile glued to the mismatched gingerbread trim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside, there is imported Tuscan marble on the floor, though the tiles are not of uniform size, and bright yellow stucco walls that Ms. Rivera said she textured using her thumb. ''It's not perfect but it's mine,'' Ms. Rivera said, touching the stucco, which looks like very thick and very messy butter cream frosting. ''I call it my doll house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix Commotion homes lost to foreclosure have resold to middle-class buyers who appreciate not only their individuality but also their energy efficiency, which is also part of Mr. Phillips's construction philosophy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Lowery and Alfredo Cerda, who both work for the United States Department of Homeland Security, bought a Phoenix Commotion house after the intended low-income owner couldn't manage the mortgage. It has mosaics on the walls and counters made of shards of broken tile and cushy flooring made out of wine corks. ''My wife likes the house because it doesn't look like everyone else's, but, being a guy, what I like is that it has a galvanized metal roof that I'll never have to replace,'' Mr. Cerda said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Phillips said it bothered him when his low-income housing became ''gentrified.'' But if it leads to an acceptance of recycled building materials and a shift away from cookie-cutter standardized construction, he said, ''I'm O.K. with it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it has a social agenda, Phoenix Commotion is not a nonprofit. ''I want to show that you can make money doing this,'' Mr. Phillips said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he earned enough to live on but he was not getting rich. While he declined to be more specific, he allowed that the business has become more profitable as he has gained construction experience. It now takes six months to build a home rather than the 18 months it took when he started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Phillips said his biggest reward was giving less-fortunate people the opportunity to own a home and watching them develop a sense of satisfaction and self-determination in the course of building it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An example is Kristie Stevens, a single mother of two school-age sons who earned a college degree last spring while working part time as a restaurant and catering manager. She has spent the months since graduation hammering away on what will be her home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If something goes wrong with this house, I won't have to call someone to fix it because I know where all the wires and pipes are -- I can do it myself,'' she said. ''And if the walls are wonky, it will be my fault but also my pride.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- Residents began returning to their homes Wednesday in several neighborhoods that had been threatened by a large wildfire chewing through the foothills near Los Angeles as cooler temperatures and moister air allowed firefighters to begin gaining in their battle to control the blaze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authorities cautioned that the fire remains dangerous and largely out of control, but firefighters have gained enough of an upper hand to lift evacuation orders in parts of La Crescenta, La Canada-Flintridge and Altadena.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spot fires were still erupting, however, and many residents in other communities at the edge of the Angeles National Forest were told to be prepared to leave if the flames headed their way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said at a morning news conference in San Bernardino County that the largest of several fires in the Angeles National Forest was 22 percent contained. It has so far consumed 140,000 acres and destroyed 92 structures, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The crews are making excellent progress based on the improved weather conditions,'' Mike Dietrich, a commander for the United States Forest Service, said at the briefing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The governor also served breakfast to firefighters and thanked them for their efforts. Two firefighters were killed when their vehicle overturned Sunday as fire advanced on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm so proud to have the best, and the most courageous and the toughest firefighters in the world,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said, adding that he had served them ''spinach and protein so they get all pumped up for the fight out there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The governor said he had signed an executive order to waive fees and help recovery efforts for the victims of the wildfires in Los Angeles, Mariposa, Monterey, Placer, Santa Cruz and Yuba Counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said many people were being allowed to return to their homes as the fires were pushed back. Mandatory evacuation orders were lifted for residents of about 3,000 homes in San Bernardino County, as the weather cooler and humidity levels aided in efforts to contain the fires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fire officials said they had made significant progress putting out seven other fires burning in the state. For the first time in California, a 747 jet reconfigured as an air tanker capable of dumping 19,000 gallons of water was used on a blaze in San Bernardino County and later at a fire near Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That saved lives and kept property loss to a minimum,'' said Del Walters, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. He said the authorities would consider using the plane in other fires, depending on the terrain and other conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fire burning near Los Angeles, known as the Station Fire after its origin near a ranger station in the Angeles National Forest, is likely to be remembered not as the biggest nor worst to have raked the area, but one of the weirder blazes in Southern California in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fire at one point was spreading in five directions, even though the gale-force winds that normally whip Southern California fires into infernos and swallow whole neighborhoods, were absent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, an unusual mix of fuel, from chaparral and dry grass at lower elevations to pine at higher ones, coupled with record heat and slopes that are among the steepest of any mountain range in the country, posed some of the toughest challenges firefighters have seen in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This kind of fire spread is unprecedented without wind,'' said Stanton Florea, a spokesman for the Angeles National Forest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firefighters marveled at its intensity and its fickle, multipronged nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its spread in so many directions at once, said Mark Whaling, a Los Angeles County fire captain, was ''very rare'' and taxing for firefighters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dietrich, of the Forest Service, said the fire had turned from ''angry'' to ''cranky,'' a little more under control but still stubborn to put out because of its size and the terrain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of strong winds, however, has allowed the authorities to set more backfires near homes, fighting fire with fire. Firefighters also were digging trenches and clearing brush near communities that seemed in the path of flames.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott L. Stephens, an associate professor of fire science at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies wildfires, said the fire would provide a fresh reminder that topography and the makeup of dry brush could prove just as troublesome as wind-driven blazes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even without winds, with that fuel bed you could have extreme fire behavior,'' Dr. Stephens said. ''Fire is not always going to be linked to wind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Angeles National Forest, the mountainous wilderness 20 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, on average has more than 200 fires a year, though most are quickly extinguished. The cause of this fire is under investigation, but more than 90 percent of the fires there are caused by people, accidentally or intentionally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fire seemed sure to renew debates about building homes in close proximity to wilderness. While many homeowners take precautions like clearing brush from their property and leaving a fire area when told to do so, the police have reported that several people have chosen to stay put, endangering themselves and firefighters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early Tuesday, a group of residents in an area the authorities had ordered evacuated the day before watched as flames drew closer to their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anna Aragel, 50, a resident of the area, Big Tujunga Canyon, said through a mask that she and several neighborhoods stayed ''because we felt we had open outlets, we could get out easily if needed, and we wanted to stay with our homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, as the flames appeared to grow more intense, she prepared to leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stephens, the Berkeley fire scholar, said that vast expanses of brush in the state had yet to burn, and with a drought in the past several years, much of it is very dry. The Station Fire area had not burned in about four decades, which he said was about average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in places like Los Angeles, where many homes are in or close to the wilderness, such big fires ''continue to point to the challenges of learning to live with fire as part of the landscape,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How do we position houses?'' Dr. Stephens asked. ''How or do we rebuild them? It is a recurring theme.''</p>
<p>Randal C. Archibold and Rebecca Cathcart contributed reporting from Los Angeles, and Maria Newman from New York.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about distress in the commercial real estate sector incorrectly paraphrased a comment by Richard Parkus, a research analyst for Deutsche Bank, about recent market trends. He said that office vacancies are increasing and rents are decreasing, not the other way around. The article also misstated the dollar total of commercial mortgages that are due to expire by the end of next year and the total that had been due to expire this year but were extended. The amounts are $393 billion (not million) and $39 billion (not million), respectively. And the article referred incorrectly to Murray Hill Properties' mortgage payments on the building it owns at One Park Avenue. The mortgage is current; the company has not missed a payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Thu Sep 03 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the commercial real estate market heated up earlier in the decade and lenders competed feverishly to issue ever-riskier mortgages, hundreds of bankers, investors, lawyers, brokers, appraisers, accountants and analysts flocked to an investors' conference in Florida each January to celebrate their good fortune with lavish beach parties featuring bikini-clad models and popular entertainers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in what a <span class="companylink">Prudential Real Estate</span> Investors report described as ''a move of near-perfect symbolism,'' the conference sponsor, the Commercial Mortgage Securities Association, recently announced that next year's event would be relocated from South Beach to Washington, where the industry has been lobbying strenuously for federal assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, the people who buy and sell office buildings, shopping centers, warehouses, apartment buildings and hotels are hardly in a festive mood, despite some recent encouraging signs relating to the job and housing markets and a recent increase in sales of small office buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though industry lobbyists were able to persuade Congress to extend a loan program aimed at prodding the stalled securitization market back to life, several analysts said it was unlikely to head off a spate of defaults, foreclosures and bankruptcies that could surpass the devastating real estate crash of the early 1990s. ''It will prop up a few deals, but you can't stop the wave that's coming,'' said Peter Hauspurg, the chief executive of Eastern Consolidated, a New York brokerage firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The distress is still in its early stages, analysts said. ''We are between the first and second inning,'' said Richard Parkus, who directs research on commercial mortgage-backed securities for <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>. ''We're going to have to get through a very difficult period.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parkus said that vacancy declines and rent increases already mirrored what happened in the 1990s, and until new jobs were created, generating an increase in demand for commercial space and more retail spending, this was not likely to be reversed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building values have declined by as much as 50 percent around the country, and even more in Manhattan, where prices soared the highest. As many as 65 percent of commercial mortgages maturing over the next few years are unlikely to qualify for refinancing because of the drop in values and new stricter underwriting standards, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fitch Ratings recently reported that $36.1 billion in securitized loans -- mortgages pooled, sliced into different categories of risk and sold to investors -- have been transferred so far this year to a ''special servicer,'' an agency that handles troubled loans. Such a transfer is prompted by a bankruptcy, a 60-day delinquency or the prospect of an imminent default. In all, some 3,100 loans representing $49.1 billion, or 6.1 percent of the total, are currently in special servicing, an amount that could grow to nearly $100 billion by the end of the year, Fitch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the damage is expected to be even greater for banks, which are holding $1.3 trillion in commercial mortgages (including apartment buildings) and $535.8 billion in construction and development loans, said Sam Chandan, the president of Real Estate Economics, a New York research company. About $393 million worth of mortgages are scheduled to mature by the end of next year alone, and an estimated $39 million more were due to expire this year but have been extended, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By midyear, <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York research company, had identified $124 billion worth of distressed property. Less than 10 percent of the distress had been resolved through loan modifications or sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downturn in commercial real estate is already having repercussions for local governments. New York City's general fund, to cite an example, collected $2.1 billion from transfer and mortgage recording taxes at the peak of the market in the 2007 fiscal year, according to Frank Braconi, chief economist for the comptroller's office. This fiscal year, it is expected to receive only $767 million, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, with its concentration of tall office towers, commercial mortgage-backed securities play a bigger role than they do elsewhere. The brokerage firm <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> estimates that about half the transactions in recent years involved securitized financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mechanism set up to manage problems with the underlying mortgages is being put to the test for the first time. Some longtime real estate investors who profited from the ready access to mortgages made possible by securitization now complain that the system is impersonal and rigid. Instead of negotiating directly with a lender sitting across a table, Norman Sturner, a partner at <span class="companylink">Murray Hill Properties</span>, a New York real estate company, said he had been forced to deal by telephone with ''a third party sitting out in the Midwest'' who seemed indifferent to his problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the master servicer, which handles the routine servicing of the loan, has no authority to restructure it, the landlord has no way to tackle anticipated problems before it comes into the hands of a special servicer and is already in trouble. ''What's going to happen when billions of dollars can't be repaid?'' said Mr. Sturner, who owns and operates five million square feet of office and apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sturner, a 39-year industry veteran who bought aggressively during the real estate boom, would not comment on any specific loans. But a Manhattan real estate executive, who declined to be identified commenting on another's business dealings, said that Mr. Sturner recently stopped paying his mortgage on One Park Avenue, a 20-story Art Deco building between 32nd and 33rd Streets, which he bought for $550 million in 2007, so that he could have the loan transferred to a special servicer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, one tenant, the <span class="companylink">Segal Company</span>, a company specializing in employee benefits, said it would move at the end of this year to West 34th Street, leaving three floors at One Park Avenue vacant when new tenants are hard to come by and rents have fallen significantly. Fitch downgraded the securities backed by this loan in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising incidence of delinquencies and defaults has cast a spotlight on the special servicers, who are chosen by the investors who hold the riskiest bonds, and, in most cases, are part of the same firm. Six companies control 85 percent of the business, according to Fitch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One source of conflict is that pension funds, endowments and other institutional investors with the most protected securities are often eager to liquidate their positions as quickly as possible, and those with the riskier portions resist taking an immediate loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick C. Sargent, the president of the Commercial Mortgage Securities Association, said that despite an apparent conflict of interest, the servicers are accountable to all classes of bondholders and are required to maximize the proceeds for the investment as a whole. Falling short can lead to a lawsuit or a ratings downgrade. ''They are in a fishbowl,'' he said. ''They are going to be watched.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say the special servicers are overwhelmed by the current workload. ''The people we are dealing with are swamped beyond any measure,'' said Paul M. Fried, a managing director of Traxi, a New York consulting company, who is advising borrowers with securitized loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one executive at a special servicer whose employer would not allow his or his company's name to be used said that his firm had tripled its staff in the last two years, and that other companies were also hiring asset managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the criticism, Stephanie Petosa, a managing director at Fitch, which rates special servicers, said they were equipped to handle the workload. ''I think they are moving at a reasonable pace, given the current environment,'' she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY   </div><div>1037 words</div><div>2 September 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a rising number of half-finished and half-empty condo projects clutter the skyline, state and city officials have begun developing programs to turn hundreds of these apartments into moderate-income housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those efforts have proved far from easy. With budgets tighter than ever, there are few financial incentives to entice developers and lenders. And there are the practical challenges of selling apartments to buyers for far less than what their neighbors paid, not least among them possible complications for market-rent buyers, whose mortgages often depend on the building's financial status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As housing officials work through the early stages of devising the programs, questions abound in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, said that while empty buildings were not ideal, efforts to use them for moderate-income housing also presented problems. ''In the long run,'' he said, ''it would be reasonable to assume that there would be a negative impact on property values, separate and apart from change in market conditions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Priscilla Almodovar, chief executive of the New York State Housing Finance Agency, said that a plan now in its early stages would most likely include offering homebuyers state-financed mortgages for units in buildings where some have already been sold to market-rate buyers. In that case, developers would also cut the price of the apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another program would set aside $5 million for $40,000 grants to 125 homebuyers. For example, a single person or couple making $92,160 or less would qualify to buy a $380,000 apartment, using a $40,000 grant that the state provides the developer. A family of three or more making $107,520 would qualify to buy a $411,000 apartment. With these types of programs, the state typically requires buyers to hold on to the units for 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Almodovar stressed that the program would take some time to develop, because the state had no experience with turning half-finished buildings into moderately priced housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no playbook here,'' she said. ''We're trying to figure out how hard this is.'' So far, officials are seriously talking with one developer on a condo project in Fort Greene, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate move, Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries introduced legislation on Tuesday to help developers refinance troubled loans worth up to $150 million and make it easier to turn troubled condo and rental projects at all stages of construction into moderate-income rental units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To qualify for the program, the loans would have had to be secured during the building boom from 2004 to 2008. The refinanced loans, held by the state, would require developers to add moderately priced housing, which Mr. Jeffries said he hoped would make up 50 percent of these buildings' units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Jeffries's Brooklyn district -- which includes parts of Clinton Hill, Fort Greene, Prospect Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights -- there are 66 condo projects in some stage of development, including a handful in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those in foreclosure that Mr. Jeffries has identified are 118-120 Lexington Avenue and 525 Clinton Avenue. Calls to representatives of those buildings were not returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said there were also buildings that are probably in trouble that he did not know about yet. For example, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and the developer the Clarett Group recently handed back the Forte, at 230 Ashland Place, to the lender, Eurohypo Bank, before he even knew about the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jeffries said he had also been working with Representative Edolphus Towns, chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, to help pressure banks that received federal money to work with the state to release developers from troubled mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many of these institutions continue to receive TARP money,'' Mr. Jeffries said, referring to the Troubled Asset Relief Program. ''It is the right thing for these banks to recirculate these tax dollars into the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn introduced a separate $20 million program aimed at luxury rental and condo buildings that are empty, half-finished or have sold only a few units. That initiative will give preference to developers asking for subsidies of less than $50,000 per condo unit and less than $75,000 per unit for those they turn into rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mortgage brokers have already raised some practical questions about how these programs would work: What restrictions would the buyers face when they later try to sell? How will the programs affect local real estate values?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melissa Cohn, president of Manhattan Mortgage, which has arranged thousands of local mortgages, questions how market-rate buyers will be able to get mortgages in buildings where the makeup of the units have changed and may no longer meet lenders' requirements. Then there is paying for the management of the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very hard, in a building that is 30 percent sold and closed, to designate the balance of the building affordable housing,'' Ms. Cohn said. ''The costs of carrying a building doesn't change. Do you get rid of the doorman? Eliminate the gym? Close down the party room?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With one group of buyers paying lower prices, Keith Kantrowitz, the president of Power Express Mortgage Bankers in Lake Success, N.Y., questioned how these buildings would divide the costs of the amenities that condo developers adopted in the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Are they going to have a badge saying that they can't use the pool?'' he said. ''No one has done this yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, government officials say their modest efforts are far better than the alternative: letting buildings sit empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we just did nothing, everyone would lose. The neighborhoods lose,'' said Ms. Almodovar of the State Housing Finance Agency. ''Everyone benefits if we help bring in new buyers, stabilize the market, taking ownership of the community.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By JACK HEALY   </div><div>847 words</div><div>2 September 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 18 months of layoffs, plant shutdowns and other declines, the country's manufacturing sector grew in August, offering another piece of evidence that the economy was pulling out of recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management's survey of factories and industry had been edging higher this spring, as the blistering pace of economic declines began to level off. But last month, the group's manufacturing index turned positive, rising to 52.9, from 48.9 in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reading above 50 indicates expansion and growth; a number below 50 means economic contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama called the numbers ''a sign that we're on the path to economic recovery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies that make textiles, paper products, computers and electronics, appliances and chemicals were among 11 industry groups that said their business had grown in August. They said new orders were flowing in, production was ticking up and their prices were rising. ''It is a big deal,'' said John E. Silvia, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>. ''It does suggest that manufacturing is recovering.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bit by bit, the picture is improving for manufacturers like Allied PhotoChemical, a company in eastern Michigan that makes environmentally attuned ink, paint and coatings. Some 40 percent of its business disappeared last year as the economy swooned, but Allied's president, Mike Kelly, said the company had gone after new customers and resisted the reflex to slash its work force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelly said Allied was now running at about 65 percent capacity, compared with a low of 40 percent early this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You could hear the crickets chirping,'' he said. ''Our suppliers were calling us, giving us automatic price reductions. They were panicking. Now they're happy. They're even beginning to have some product shortages.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many factories slashed their output and idled assembly lines over the last year as demand for their products dried up and the turmoil of the housing market spilled into the broader economy. But now, after cutting their inventories to the quick, some businesses are starting to rebuild their stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Ford Motor Company</span> has said that it would increase production by 10,000 vehicles to meet the higher demand generated by the government's cash-for-clunkers program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're at a very early stage of the upturn, and I think it's going to gradually build steam,'' said David Huether, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, most industries were not hiring, an indication that the labor market remained weak. The manufacturing employment index contracted again in August, although at a slower pace than in past months. Four industry groups said their payrolls were growing while nine reported decreases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing jobs have been devastated by the recession, with some two million positions lost since the downturn's official beginning in December 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, economists believe the economy lost 225,000 jobs last month, and they are expecting the unemployment rate to rise to 9.5 percent when the government releases its monthly snapshot of the labor market on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many economists expect the economy to grow during the summer quarter as businesses stir back to life, they are worried that sluggish consumer spending will weigh down the economy in the year ahead. Consumer spending fell at a rate of 1 percent in the second quarter of the year, even as tax credits from the stimulus began filtering through the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's the sustainability going forward?'' Mr. Silvia of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> said. ''So much of that depends on the consumer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Tuesday, a report on home sales that are under contract showed that buyers were flocking back to the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales surged on a seasonally adjusted basis to its highest levels since 2001, when the group began tracking the numbers. It was the sixth consecutive month of increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The recovery is broad-based across many parts of the country. Housing affordability has been at record highs this year with the added stimulus of a first-time buyer tax credit,'' Lawrence Yun, the group's chief economist, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's tax credit of up to $8,000 has been helping to entice first-time homebuyers into the market, and mortgage rates are about 5.25 percent nationwide, compared with more than 6 percent last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even if buyers are buying again, few builders are building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the Commerce Department said that construction spending fell 0.2 percent in July from a month earlier, and was 10.5 percent lower than it had been in July 2008. Although residential construction spending edged up for the month of July, it was down nearly 27 percent from a year earlier, a sign of the problems still facing builders as they compete with floods of foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on office buildings, commercial projects and hotels all fell from June.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the recession unfolds, a growing number of budget-minded business travelers are shifting to lower-price hotels, whether by choice or because their bosses are telling them to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest beneficiaries of the shift, travel experts say, are the hotels that keep prices down by not offering amenities like restaurants or meeting rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Travel managers have told us within their companies they're moving travelers to lower-tier hotels, '' said Caleb Tiller, spokesman for the National Business Travel Association. ''It's definitely a trend we've seen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said companies were taking a varied approach to the switch. Some are requiring it, others strongly encouraging it and others trying to set an example by having even top executives book more modest accommodations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those now staying at more bare-bones properties, the downgrading has some discomforts. Alan Hawrylyshen, a technology applications director for a manufacturer of mobile and voice-over-Internet networks, said he had encountered a host of minor inconveniences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At full-service hotels where he once was a regular, Mr. Hawrylyshen said checking in was welcoming and efficient. ''There was never a line. They'd be expecting you, greet you by name.'' Hopscotching to different hotels in search of low rates now means staying at places where his information is not already in the computer system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Suddenly, checking in takes longer because they have to process your credit card and you have to fill out forms,'' said Mr. Hawrylyshen, who travels one to four times a month. ''It adds 10 minutes or more, sometimes up to half an hour'' to his already hectic schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately for travelers like Mr. Hawrylyshen, this trend show no signs of abating. According to Peter C. Yesawich, chairman and chief executive at <span class="companylink">Ypartnership</span>, a travel marketing and research company, a quarter of the nearly 800 business travelers surveyed this year indicated that they were booking less expensive hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trading down has been occurring on all levels: top executives who may have previously stayed at luxury hotels are staying at full-service hotels, while middle managers who used to stay at those properties are now switching to limited-service hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you used to stay in a full-service Sheraton, Marriott or Hilton, you may trade down to a Four Points, Courtyard by Marriott or Hilton Garden Inn,'' said Al Calhoun, managing director of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> Hotels, a real estate management and investment firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry analysts say the one sector that has fared better than others is what is known in the business as ''upscale'' or ''select-service'' hotels. While the terminology may not be familiar to travelers, the brand names are likely to be; Courtyard by Marriott, Hilton Garden Inn and Four Points by Sheraton, among them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These hotels are distinguished from their full-service sister brands by a lack of restaurants, lounge areas or meeting rooms. While some hotels may have one or more of these amenities, they vary by property. By contrast, their presence is a given at full-service hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Calhoun, revenue per available room, a crucial measure of a hotel's fiscal health, has not dropped as sharply for select-service properties as it has for other types of hotels. While room rates have softened in recent months, prices have been hit hardest at luxury and full-service chains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from Smith Travel Research shows that hotel room rates dropped by an average of 8.1 percent in the first four months of the year, compared with the same period in 2008, with rates at luxury hotels falling by 13.9 percent and rates at select-service hotels declining 8.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Select-service hotels are also holding their own in occupancy. Occupancy rates are expected to fall across all hotel levels in 2009 because of the recession's impact on business and leisure travel. However, Robert Mandelbaum, director of research information services at the consulting firm PKF Hospitality Research, said select-service hotels would end the year with less of a drop than most other brands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While overall occupancy is expected to drop by 5.6 percent and luxury hotel occupancy by 8.3 percent, select-service occupancy is projected to end the year with a much smaller 3.7 percent decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This relative robustness could prove to be a double-edged sword in the coming months, though. Hotel investors and developers are increasingly flocking to these types of properties because the select-service hotels are viewed as a relatively safe haven during a time of overall distress for the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're cheaper to build, they're cheaper to maintain and they're cheaper to operate,'' said David Loeb, a real estate analyst at <span class="companylink">Robert W. Baird &amp; Company</span>. He said new hotels were opening at a rapid rate and would most likely add to the problem of too many rooms and not enough travelers to fill them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The impact of all of this new supply is a really bloody market-share war,'' he said. ''The operators of these hotels are trying really hard to achieve or keep market share, and they're doing that by lowering prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this is bad news for hotel operators, it is a silver lining for road warriors and corporate travel managers trying to hold the line on lodging expenses in a tough economy.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article last Sunday about planned changes to the lobby of the Devonshire House, a 1928 building in Greenwich Village designed by Emery Roth, misstated the scope of landmark designations in New York. Interior spaces can indeed be granted landmark status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Sep 06 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Devonshire House, a 1928 Emery Roth building, was sold in 2008 to a group of developers, marking the end of decades as a prime Greenwich Village rental, residents knew change was afoot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction workers and machinery filled the hallways as the developers, including the real estate magnate (and partial Mets owner) Fred Wilpon, began the process of carving spacious modern condominiums out of the building's 131 modest one- and two-bedroom units. Leases for market-rate tenants were not renewed, leaving only a few dozen rent-stabilized stalwarts in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of the longtime residents who managed to stay, many assumed that the Devonshire's unique aesthetic -- a hodgepodge of English, Spanish and Gothic influences -- would be left alone. The building, perched on the southeast corner of East 10th Street and University Place, has an eclectic Old World charm and a name-brand architect to boot: Roth, the maestro of Central Park West's Deco skyline, is considered one of Manhattan's finest residential designers. Surely, such features would still prove marketable today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turns out that prewar appeal has its limits. A large-scale redesign has already ripped up part of Devonshire's distinctive lobby, a time-warped salmagundi of faux-wood walls, Gothic details and an imposing coffered ceiling that brings to mind the faded Oxford common rooms of ''Brideshead Revisited.'' Now tenants are anxious about the fate of what they consider the jewel of their meticulously designed home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's such a destruction of an architectural wonder,'' said Susan Bolotin, 59, the editor in chief of <span class="companylink">Workman Publishing</span> and a 30-year resident of the building. ''It's a sense of aesthetic outrage. We've been told they can do whatever they want.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longtime residents consider the lobby singular and charming, a homey but elaborate space that often impresses guests. Stained-glass windows, topped by gothic arches, allow a view of a sunny courtyard, guarded by a row of small Corinthian columns. Elevator doors are embossed with the Cavendish coat of arms, the seal of a family whose ancestral home in England shares a name with the Manhattan residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For as long as I owned the building,'' recalled William Felder, the former proprietor, ''people would come in off the street and just fawn over that lobby.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new owners, conscious of the real estate consumer's fickle taste, say they are looking to brighten a dingy space. ''We are trying to take a tired property and freshen it up,'' Susan Hewitt, the project's lead developer, said in a telephone interview. ''The general effect we are trying to do is make it seem slightly less sepulchral.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hewitt, who has done condominium conversions on other properties with historic significance, does not draw her adjectives from thin air. The lobby had a sense of shabby elegance: the ornate ceiling is dulled by a tobacco-stained hue, and the yellowish faux-wood floor, a rare feature in Manhattan buildings, is scuffed and scratched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renovations -- assigned to the designer Victoria Hagan -- call for the installation of a black-and-white checkerboard floor; a lighter shade of paint for the walls and an off-white hue for the ceiling. A concierge desk is also planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The starkest departure from the current look is the black-and-white floor, which some tenants worry will clash with the old-English atmosphere. Ms. Hewitt said the design had ''ample historical precedent'' in Manhattan prewar buildings, and Ms. Hagan said she was being ''very sensitive'' to the original.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's something I think I'm good at, understanding something that's old and giving it fresh life for a new time,'' Ms. Hagan said recently, while overseeing construction of a new apartment on the building's fourth floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would seem unthinkable to tinker with Roth's more famous works in the city, including the Beresford and San Remo apartments on the Upper West Side; both have landmark status. And wealthy buyers happily snap up 1920s co-ops on Fifth Avenue that contain the best (rock-solid walls, original moldings) and worst (ancient plumbing) qualities of prewar construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the success of 15 Central Park West, Robert A. M. Stern's homage to old-school New York living, may suggest that buyers want a more modern take on the classics: prewar with postwar perks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the tenants at Devonshire remain unimpressed. A few reached out to preservationist societies in hopes of halting the renovation, to no avail. Interior spaces cannot be declared landmarks in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The lobby, as it is, is quite beautiful,'' said David Mann, the president of MR Architecture and Decor, who has rented a penthouse studio in the building for nearly two decades. ''I am fearful about what they might do that may never be changed back. To rip out the floors, to me, is a crime.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bolotin sounded pained when discussing the changes. ''I remember moving in and learning about Emery Roth and the buildings he had done on Central Park West; there's a sense of--'' she paused, then sighed -- ''I guess this doesn't mean much, but there's a sense of neighborhood pride. I raised my children there. We've seen generations come and go. People love living there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former owner, Mr. Felder, said that the Devonshire's purchasers had every right to change the lobby. ''In their defense, I have to say, throughout the years, we've always had trouble maintaining that floor,'' he said. ''You can clean it, but it just always looks dirty.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Felder paused when told that a black-and-white checkerboard pattern was under consideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That could be fairly atrocious,'' he said, after some contemplation. ''If it was my decision and I had to replace the floor, I would replace it with some kind of stone.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD   </div><div>1253 words</div><div>26 August 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a convincing sign that the worst housing slump of modern times is coming to an end, prices are starting to rise in nearly all of the nation's large cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend, displayed in newly released data for June, is both pronounced and wide-ranging. It is affecting the high-priced coastal cities, with a 3.8 percent jump for the month in San Francisco and a 2.6 percent rise in Boston; the industrial Midwest, with Cleveland prices up 4.2 percent; and even the epicenter of the crash, the Sun Belt, with Phoenix homes up 1.1 percent. These numbers are not seasonally adjusted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighteen of the 20 cities tracked by <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller Home Price Index showed improvement in June, up from eight in May, four in April and only one in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I saw these numbers, I danced a jig,'' said Karl E. Case, a co-developer of the index and an economics professor at Wellesley College. ''It appears that the housing market is stabilizing quicker than people thought it would.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further confirmation that the market is recovering came in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's house price index, which was also released Tuesday. It rose 0.5 percent in June after a revised increase of 0.6 percent in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government index is based on price information from mortgages acquired by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government's housing finance arms, which means it has fewer high-priced houses than Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recently as six months ago, there was widespread expectation that housing prices, which were already down nearly a third from their peaks, would tumble another 10 percent. That decline would most likely have prompted another round of foreclosures, perhaps helping to delay a recovery in the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, said Mr. Case, it is likely such a grim event will be averted. ''Banks will stabilize their balance sheets more quickly. The toxic paper will get written off more quickly,'' he said. ''That's a big, big deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news comes on the heels of the National Association of Realtors' report on July sales volume, which showed a 5 percent rise above the pace in July 2008. It was the first year-over-year gain since the market peaked in November 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improving real estate market is a combination of many factors: federal and local government assistance for first-time buyers, receding fears that an economic depression is at hand, low interest rates and, above all, cheaper prices than have been seen in many cities for a long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jessi Havel, a library technician, and Ben Meyer, a university faculty assistant, love San Francisco but thought they were condemned to rent forever. Then friends pointed out that their $2,000 in rent would cover quite a bit of mortgage in a city where prices were back to where they were in mid-2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seemed like this was our one and only chance to buy here,'' said Ms. Havel, 30. So in June they did, paying $456,000 for a cottage in the up-and-coming neighborhood of Mission Terrace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Havel and Mr. Meyer benefited from a city loan program for first-time buyers. Ilse Cordoni, president of the San Francisco Association of Realtors, said such assistance, whether city, state or federal, was providing crucial support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, originally designed for the working poor, used to be practically unknown in San Francisco, Ms. Cordoni said. Now they are popular, since they require only a 3 percent down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Government help is really helping,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the improvement reflected in the new Case-Shiller report, housing prices are still down sharply in comparison to last year's figures. The increases reported on Tuesday show up when June's transaction prices are compared with those of the month before. But when this June is compared with June of 2008, the 20-city composite index is still down 15.4 percent -- an improvement from the 19.1 price decline of last winter. Average home prices are now at the level they were in early 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index, the most closely watched home price index, is usually reported without any seasonal adjustments. Since home-buying traditionally is strongest in the spring, that prompted criticism with last month's report that the long-awaited improvements were less hopeful than they seemed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even on a seasonally adjusted basis, the index was up 0.7 percent in June. It was the first such increase since May 2006. Instead of 18 cities increasing in June, on a seasonally adjusted basis only 15 did. The two best-performing cities, Cleveland and San Francisco, were up 3.3 percent and 3.1 percent respectively after adjusting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael T. Darda, chief economist of MKM Partners, called the June report ''highly encouraging.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The interaction between falling home prices with high household debt loads was the trigger point for the 2007-8 financial crisis, resulting in both the longest and deepest recession in postwar history,'' he wrote in a research note. ''Now, though, it would appear that the tide is turning.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S.&amp; P. also released on Tuesday the national Case-Shiller index, which covers a sample of homes across the country, including rural areas and smaller cities. That index increased 2.9 percent in the second quarter, indicating that the recovery extended beyond the urban centers. It was the first quarter-over-quarter increase in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 20-city index, the New York metro area ranked far back in the pack, increasing only 0.4 percent in June. The two cities that declined were Detroit and Las Vegas, among the most economically troubled places in the country. Las Vegas prices are now down 54.3 percent from their peak. Detroit has fallen 45.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the back-to-back increases in the 20-city composite for May and June, there is little doubt that the market has picked up. The debate is now shifting to whether the upturn can be sustained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts note that some sales are probably due to a rush to buy in advance of the December expiration of an $8,000 first-time buyers' tax credit. The National Association of Realtors is lobbying to have the credit extended or broadened, but neither is a sure thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The tax credit may be shifting sales forward,'' said Patrick Newport, United States economist for IHS Global Insight. ''There are also unintended effects that could hurt the market. It's stimulating construction, but we have too many homes already.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures are another big unknown. Prices were pushed down last year by an abundance of bank-owned properties hitting the market. This spring, fewer foreclosures have prompted bidding wars. But with unemployment nearing 10 percent, there are probably more foreclosures to come.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty months into a deep recession, the real estate market is battered and the print news media are doing even worse. What kind of time is this for a money-losing publisher to start a print publication about real estate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A perfect one, according to Jared Kushner, owner of The New York Observer, who is about to introduce The Commercial Observer, a weekly newspaper on the commercial real estate market in New York City. The first issue will be published Sept. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project combines two elements -- a niche topic and a local focus -- that analysts say have become central to success in a deeply troubled newspaper industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think now everyone's interested in the real estate market, and a product that covers it closely will have great value to advertisers,'' Mr. Kushner said in an interview. ''Right now, there are no building sales but there are a lot of leases. There are a lot of deals that happen that don't get picked up anywhere in the media. But people in real estate care.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commercial Observer, with 24 to 28 pages an issue, will be delivered free to 10,000 people in the city's real estate business. The new paper will sell subscriptions for $240 a year, and it may eventually charge industry insiders, as well, Mr. Kusher said, but ''what I care about most is that the right people are getting it.'' There will be no newsstand sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paper will have plenty of competition from publications like The Real Deal, a monthly magazine, and Real Estate Weekly, which both cover the region's commercial and residential real estate markets; and from more mainstream publications like Crain's New York Business, a weekly, and the city's daily newspapers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observer executives decided that they would fare best with a narrower subject area, commercial property, and avoid cannibalizing the gossipy, popular and Manhattan-centric residential real estate coverage The Observer is known for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With advertising slumping badly, The Observer recently laid off a large portion of its staff and shifted to relying more heavily on freelancers. But Mr. Kushner said that the paper had become more cost-efficient and that some other parts of the company, the Observer Media Group, including its PolitickerNY and PolitickerNJ Web sites, were thriving financially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the company, he said, ''we're going to lose less money this year than last year, and next year we're going to be close to break-even.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commercial Observer will share the salmon-colored paper, tabloid format and top editors of its parent paper. The company said the new paper would have some additional personnel, but it would not provide figures.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes surged in July as buyers stormed back to the market, taking advantage of falling prices, lower interest rates and a tax credit for first-time homeowners, an industry group reported on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of condos and single-family homes each rose for the month, and the overall number of existing home sales rose 7.2 percent in July from June, the National Association of Realtorsreported. It was the largest monthly gain since the group began tracking existing home sales in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, home sales last month were 5 percent higher than in July 2008. Homes were selling at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.2 million in July, up from a rate of 5 million last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the first year-over-year increase in home sales since November 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm a little bit flabbergasted,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight. ''These are really good numbers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 30 percent of the homes sold in July were distressed properties like short sales or foreclosures, but that is a lower percentage than in previous months, when nearly half of all existing-home sales were estimated to be foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, economists said, Friday's numbers offered another signal that the housing market was climbing out of the basement, even as foreclosures and delinquencies creep higher amid rising job losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales -- which make up the bulk of home sales -- have risen over the last four months after crashing to record-low levels during the collapse of the housing market last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes rose 11 percent in June from a month earlier and are up since the winter, even though they are sharply lower than in the peak years of the housing boom. And sale prices for single-family homes are starting to stabilize in some of the country's most distressed markets as bargain-hunters snap up distressed properties and cheap foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price of homes nationwide fell to $178,400, and more homes poured onto the market as foreclosures increased and sellers detected a hint of enthusiasm among buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the Realtors' association, cheered the latest numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing market has decisively turned for the better,'' he said in a statement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A map on Aug. 20 with an article about the preservation of historic houses in the Carriage Town neighborhood of Flint, Mich., gave incorrect boundaries for the area. They are Fifth Avenue on the north, North Saginaw Street on the east, the Flint River on the south, and Begole Street and Atwood Stadium on the west.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Thu Sep 10 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ERIN CAUDELL is house-hunting in Flint, Mich., a city with a rapidly shrinking population, thousands of vacant structures and a 28.6 percent unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Caudell, 31, a horticulturalist, has focused her search on Carriage Town, the neighborhood where she leases a blue two-story house with pink and purple trim that she shares with three friends, paying $300 a month for her rent and utilities. Ms. Caudell hopes to find a home that won't cost more than $50,000, including renovation expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She's drawn to the affordable prices, historic architecture and sense of community in Carriage Town, just across the river from the city's downtown. Ms. Caudell, who grew up in nearby Burton, also likes the easy commute to her job as an outreach program coordinator with the Ruth Mott Foundation, where she promotes urban gardening and local beautification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I love old houses,'' she said. ''I want the character and the history you can't get from a new cookie-cutter house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she has one concern that is surprising given Flint's well-documented economic malaise: she is worried that Carriage Town will become too gentrified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't want to live in an area that's like a suburb,'' Ms. Caudell said. ''I don't want Carriage Town to become the hip neighborhood. I like it the way it is now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a city that is synonymous with faded American industrial and automotive power, Carriage Town's success is both unexpected and inspiring. A persistent group of long-term urban homesteaders -- along with newer arrivals eager to live near a downtown showing signs of life -- has restored dozens of Victorian-era houses and buildings in the last 20 years. While many Flint neighborhoods feel all but abandoned, in Carriage Town home ownership has increased 10 percent over the last decade, according to Census data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a worldwide recession, development projects with more than $47 million in public and private financing are in progress or recently completed in the 30-square-block Carriage Town area, including the conversion of the derelict Berridge Hotel into lofts and the ongoing renovation of the long-vacant Durant Hotel into 93 apartments and commercial space. There are even plans for a neighborhood grocery store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's no denying that Carriage Town is a work in progress, and that those who call it home must deal with challenges like speculators, abandoned houses and lack of code enforcement by the cash-strapped city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it is racially and economically diverse, there are few African-American homeowners. Many empty houses sit beside pristinely restored homes. Residents also remember AutoWorld and other once-promising redevelopment failures immortalized two decades ago in Michael Moore's film ''Roger &amp; Me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken Van Wagoner owns two houses and runs the Good Beans Cafe, which has served as the primary gathering spot for Carriage Town residents since it opened in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm excited about all the new projects, but I'm also a little wary,'' he said. ''I can't help wondering if it will all last. In the same breath, I want Carriage Town to succeed more than anybody.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven years ago, Rebecca Fedewa and Nathan Murphy paid $90,000 for a property that takes up five city lots. Standing near the hot tub on the back deck of their two-story cornflower-blue house, the couple can take in their herb and vegetable garden, compost heap and the various fruit trees and berry bushes they planted in the yard, where their two dogs have plenty of room to run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I grew up in Lansing, and when I told people I was moving to Flint they were like, 'Are you kidding me?' '' said Ms. Fedewa, 36, the executive director of the Flint River Watershed Coalition. ''But we never had a lot of apprehension about moving here. When we lived in various suburbs, we were never engaged in our community at all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They decided to buy in part because she liked being able to walk to her office in downtown Flint. They haven't been disappointed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now we know everybody,'' she said. ''You have a hard time getting your yard work done because people stop by to talk. You really feel like you're part of something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Murphy, a 38-year-old environmental policy analyst with the Michigan Senate Democrats who commutes to Lansing, says he sometimes gets surprised reactions when he tells people he lives near downtown Flint. He likes to respond that he has a half-acre of land and can still walk to the Soggy Bottom Bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The entire time we've been here, the state has drifted through a recession year after year, yet things have slowly gotten better in Carriage Town,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''Now the rest of the country has caught our recession, but the big projects are starting to come through here and it seems like things are picking up faster than ever.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carriage Town was once a thriving residential and manufacturing area, home to the carriage-making industry. But by the 1980s, it had the highest crime rate in a city consistently ranked among the most dangerous in the country, as well as a decaying collection of historic structures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ill-fated AutoWorld theme park played an unexpected role in spurring Carriage Town's revival. Anticipating that the neighborhood could become a tourist attraction, the city helped restore Water Street, which had a few dilapidated carriage factories and a crumbling brick building considered the birthplace of the General Motors Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When AutoWorld closed soon after it opened in 1984, Carriage Town's recovery was largely left to residents committed to saving housing stock that included Queen Annes, Greek revivals and American foursquares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David White and Nick Hoffman were among them. The couple had been in their first Carriage Town home, a battered Queen Anne, for only a few days in 1983 when yelling woke them up. They watched several men hustle the manager of a nearby apartment building through the darkened street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They were literally dragging him along by his necktie,'' Mr. White said. ''They stuffed him into the trunk of a car and roared off around the corner. We had no idea what to do. We didn't even have phone service yet. I remember thinking, 'What have we gotten ourselves into?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the manager reappeared the next day, his arm in a sling, Mr. White drew on the ample reserves of optimism demanded of anyone trying to improve Flint at the time. ''Well, at least he didn't die,'' he thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and Mr. Hoffman quickly realized they needed to save more than their house, which was once owned by Charles W. Nash, a president of G.M. and the founder of Nash Motors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of a sudden, we became community activists,'' he said. ''We had a lot to fight: the prostitutes, the drug dealers, the petty thieves and the slumlords.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They helped create a neighborhood association, organized huge yearly cleanups and eventually rehabbed several different homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Freeman, who has lived in the neighborhood for 15 years, credits the two men with saving Carriage Town. ''David and Nick were very persuasive in convincing new people to buy in the neighborhood,'' he said. ''They laid the groundwork for everything that's happening now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Freeman was a 24-year-old AmeriCorps volunteer when he and his partner, Perry Compton, bought their first house in Carriage Town in 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their battle-scarred, 3,850-square-foot Carpenter Gothic home was just a block from the site of an old dairy once run by Mr. Freeman's family. The couple loved the architecture, the historical connection and the price -- $25,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We signed a purchase agreement two weeks after wespotted it,'' said Mr. Freeman, now a senior program officer at the local field office of L.I.S.C., a national nonprofit group that helps local residents transform distressed neighborhoods and has helped finance various Carriage Town projects. ''Fortunately, I was young and stupid. There's been some agony, but that's what wine is for, right?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their house -- a 12-room home built by a transplanted New York businessman in 1872 -- had been chopped up into five apartments. Mr. Freeman and Mr. Compton lived in one unit and rented out the rest to cover the mortgage, restoring parts of the home as tenants moved out. They connected with a third-generation plasterer who taught Mr. Compton the trade before he died. The pair became experts in everything from faux finishes to boiler repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, after $100,000 worth of restoration, the house has elaborate plaster work and a 1790 fireplace salvaged from a London hotel. The yard is lush; Mr. Freeman returned home one evening to find a deer nibbling at his lilac bushes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The neighborhood is so radically different now,'' he said. ''I have to laugh when I hear the things some of the newcomers complain about. They don't realize what it used to be like.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Locals point to the renovation of the Berridge Hotel as an important element in Carriage Town's upswing. When its 99 rooms were renting for $19 a night, the Berridge was well known as a haven for people plying the drug and sex trades, and as housing of last resort for some of Flint's poorest citizens, including recent parolees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The residents basically had the private-sector equivalent of a jail cell,'' said Dan Kildee, chairman of the Genesee County Land Bank and the county treasurer. ''They didn't have a bathroom, they didn't have a sink and they didn't have a kitchen. It was a living situation that forced them out onto the street and into the neighborhood on a daily basis. It wasn't good for the residents and it wasn't good for Carriage Town.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank cobbled together $6.2 million from 18 different sources to transform the Berridge into 17 apartments, now almost all rented, and to renovate the Tinlin House, a Craftsman-style four-unit apartment building next door. The project was completed last December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The new Berridge is a monumental change,'' said Mr. Hoffman, who is no longer living with Mr. White, although both remain involved with the neighborhood. Mr. Hoffman runs the Carriage Town Antiques Center and owns Hoffman's Deco Deli and Cafe with two sons from an early marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working behind the deli counter, Heath Hoffman, his son, added, ''We get everyone in here from college kids to church ladies now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all the changes, residents new and old display a fierce devotion to their neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're very passionate about Carriage Town, and we don't give up,'' said Leanne Barkus, 43, who moved from Ann Arbor in 2000 to buy a two-story house for $63,000, and later acquired a pair of adjacent lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I knew everyone within a month of moving in,'' Ms. Barkus said. ''If I need a jump for my car in the winter, I've got 20 people I can call. Four neighbors have my house keys. Whoever thought you could have that in Flint?''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Construction spending rose for the second time in three months in June as residential building increased, the latest indication that the housing sector might be recovering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said construction spending increased by a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.3 percent in June, defying analysts' estimates of a 0.5 percent drop. Still, construction spending of $965.7 billion is 10.2 percent below the year-ago level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction rose at a 0.5 percent rate after dropping 3.1 percent in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data follow reports earlier this month that new and existing home sales each rose in June, and new home construction increased by the largest amount in eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another economic report, a private sector index measuring the health of United States manufacturing declined last month at the slowest pace since August, as companies increase production to restock bare shelves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing executives, said its manufacturing index read 48.9, up from 44.8 in June. That's better than the 46.2 reading analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July was the 18th consecutive month of deterioration in manufacturing -- a reading below 50 indicates contraction. But the pace of decline has been slowing since the index hit a 28-year low of 32.9 in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moderating decline in American manufacturing mirrors improvements in the industrial sectors in China, Britain and Europe.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AMID the flurry of signs that much of the state home sales market began a recovery in June, there was pretty clear evidence that Hudson County, across the river from Manhattan, was undergoing no such thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominiums make up roughly 80 percent of Hudson's housing stock -- and across the price spectrum, they have sold poorly, according to the Otteau Valuation Group, which reports to the housing industry. Even for those priced under $400,000, Otteau reported an 11-month inventory build-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos priced at $1 million and up weren't selling at all; in June, there was not a single signed contract for a condo in that price range in Hudson County, although 86 were listed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had one sell for $961,000 in April at Crystal Point'' in Jersey City, said Adrienne Albert, the chief executive of the Marketing Directors Inc., the broker for the project. ''And we've had 13 sales in July, with an average sales price over $750,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, at Gull's Cove in Jersey City, the developer Dean S. Geibel of Metro Homes, said three contracts were close to being signed -- ''as in people measuring to see if their furniture would fit'' -- for penthouses priced around $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, the picture painted by Otteau's latest numbers does not present a penthouse-worthy view of the Jersey City market, or that in neighboring Hoboken, or Hudson County as a whole, even though the area is known as the ''Gold Coast.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Countywide in June, there were a total of 2,335 condos listed -- 89 fewer than in May. But there were only 191 sales, four fewer than in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing boom years in the early part of the decade, Hudson County's market was constantly the star in the monthly Otteau reports, and it did not begin to flame out until last year, about two years after the overall state market dimmed. In that trajectory it more closely resembled Manhattan's market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, in the downtown section of Jersey City -- a district proudly known as ''Wall Street West,'' until Wall Street had its meltdown last fall -- there were 404 homes on the market in June. Only 33 sold. ''That is a very low buyer-to-seller ratio,'' said Jeffrey Otteau, the president of the Otteau Group. ''Only eight buyers for each 100 homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoboken used to be the top performer in Hudson County when the county was the top performer in the state in the early 2000s. But the story in Hoboken was similar in June: 575 homes listed, 87 sales, which means demand was 15 percent of supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New listings continue to pour onto the county market, at a reported average rate of 499 condos per month, and 99 single-family houses per month, although Mr. Otteau said he believed those figures were somewhat inflated by the relisting of properties that had not sold at a higher price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Barry, a principal of Ironstate Development, a builder based in Hoboken, said that despite Hoboken's poor showing, the true ''perfect storm conditions'' were for the condo market in Jersey City. ''It's been a very pro-development city, where it was a lot easier to get projects approved than in Hoboken,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, a lot of inventory came on the market just as Wall Street was crashing -- at prices that no longer made sense to the consumer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sales will go up after prices are adjusted, but that takes some months to work out. When the market froze up, some developers got caught, and they've been sort of paralyzed while they figure out what pricing now is appropriate and workable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barry said his company decided to take a hiatus from building condos more than two years ago, although it has a large rental building under construction in Jersey City. That 15-story tower, 225 Grand, is being built in partnership with SK Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom, county condo prices rose rapidly and to unparalleled heights. A $1 million condo ceased being a bell-ringing rarity around the time Gov. Jon Corzine moved into his Hoboken condo in 2004. Early last year, the choicest units at several high-rise buildings were listed above $1.5 million, a few above $2 million -- and some even drew multiple bids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This June, the county still had four condos listed at $2.5 million and above, although five others had disappeared from the listings of the month before -- perhaps to be relisted for less, as Mr. Otteau suggested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the price range below that, $600,000 to $1 million, 27 condos sold and 343 listed units did not. This alone created a 12-month supply of unsold homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By far the largest number of condos for sale in Hudson County are priced below $600,000. In June, there were 1,902 units listed in that range. Only 164 of those sold; the result was an 11-month inventory build-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture was not much brighter in any other part of the county. A few statistical snapshots simply underscore the laggardly overall picture:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bayonne, where prices generally tend to be lower than in Hoboken and Jersey City, 15 homes sold in June, leaving a 10.8-month supply. So far this year, sales contracts have been signed for 48 condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Union City, a lower-priced alternative to adjacent Hoboken, 62 new condo listings were added in June alone; there were eight sales that month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Bergen had 47 new listings in June, but only nine sales.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a plunge lasting three years, houses have finally become cheap enough to lure buyers. That, in turn, is stabilizing prices, generating hope that the real estate market is beginning to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight cities, including Chicago, Cleveland, Denver and San Francisco, showed price increases in May, up from four in April and one in March, according to data released Tuesday. Two other cities, Charlotte, N.C., and New York, were flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time since early 2007, a composite index of 20 major cities was virtually flat, instead of down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've found the bottom,'' said Mark Fleming, chief economist for First American CoreLogic, a data firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The release of the surprisingly strong Case-Shiller Price Index, compiled by <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>, followed earlier reports that sales of existing homes rose last month for the third consecutive time, while sales of new homes rose in June by the largest percentage in eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these improvements are tentative, and come after a relentless decline that knocked more than half the value off houses in the worst-hit cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some skeptics say they believe the market is merely pausing before it resumes falling and that much of the life in the market is coming from speculators. Even the most enthusiastic analysts acknowledge that rising unemployment, another leap in foreclosures or a significant jump in interest rates could snuff out progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, hope is growing in some quarters that the worst has passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Recession is over, economy is recovering -- let's look forward and stop the backward-looking focus,'' John E. Silvia, the <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> chief economist, wrote Tuesday in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kirit Shah decided to look forward a few weeks ago. A retired forensic chemist for the New York Police Department, he closed on a house in Royal Palm Beach, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shah was not dissuaded when the salesman at K. Hovnanian Homes told him the five-bedroom place had been empty since it was finished three years ago. ''It was waiting for me,'' said Mr. Shah, 64. ''I'm on a lakefront. I never dreamed I would be on a lakefront. I'm within walking distance of a swimming pool.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the thing he likes best is this: he paid $260,000 for the five-bedroom house, half of what that model was fetching during the boom. ''An excellent deal,'' he said. ''Plus I got a good rate on my mortgage, under 5 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turning markets are full of uncertainty. If Mr. Shah was one reason new home sales were up 11 percent in June from May, it is unclear just how many others like him are out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Hunter, chief economist for Metrostudy, a research firm, said the new home numbers appeared to illustrate less a return of buyers like Mr. Shah and more a resurgence of investors and speculators. Metrostudy's own data showed that the number of buyers during the second quarter who actually moved into their new house declined 2.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Investors are turning right around and putting the houses on the market for sale or for rent,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''What appears to have been an absorption of excess inventory can be just a changing of ownership of that inventory.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news in the Case-Shiller index, the most widely watched source of price information about the housing market, is equally provisionary. Tracking only large urban areas, the monthly index does not represent the country as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller figures released Tuesday showed May prices were down 17.1 compared with May 2008. As bad as that may sound, it was the fourth consecutive month that price declines slowed -- a step in the right direction, but perhaps not cause for widespread celebration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More attention was focused on the news that, when May was compared with April, the price index for 20 major cities showed a half-percent gain. It was the first month-over-month increase in the index in 34 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is very possible that years from now we will say that April 2009 was the trough in home prices,'' said Maureen Maitland, vice president for index services at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the numbers were adjusted for seasonal factors, however -- the usual way housing figures are presented -- the slight gain disappeared and the index was essentially flat. Half of the cities showed continued declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason the market is perking up in some places, real estate agents say, is the encouragement offered by such measures as the first time buyer's tax credit of $8,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the more reason, said the National Association of Realtors, to not only extend the credit but expand it. The association is lobbying for the current credit, which expires in December, to be replaced with a $15,000 credit for all buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a relatively low-cost way to keep the housing market moving forward,'' said Paul Bishop, the association's managing director of research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason for the market's resurgence is the prevalence of foreclosures, which make up about a third of all existing home sales. In some troubled regions, agents say they cannot remember the last transaction that did not involve a bank disposing of a property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These communities are not yet showing any improvement in prices. Las Vegas was the worst-performing city in the May Case-Shiller index, falling 2.6 percent. Prices have fallen there by a third in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The mom and pop that work at the Hilton can now afford a home here again,'' said Justin Pechonis, a Las Vegas real estate agent. ''Las Vegas is a great place to buy now.'' But not from him. Sickened by seeing so many clients foreclosed on, he is getting out of the business. He now drives a taxi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this uncertainty breeds a hesitancy that seems to show up in nearly every sale, especially at the higher end of the market. When Margot and Pascal Lalonde decided in April to sell their two-bedroom condominium in the North End of Boston, they methodically quizzed six experienced agents about a good price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">List it for under $500,000 unless you want to be here for months, said one agent. Two others said they should demand $675,000. The other three were in between.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a market with so few sales, no one knows what to do,'' said Ms. Lalonde, a consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 80 days on the market and two small price reductions, the condo is now under contract for $550,000. The buyers examined the apartment six times. The Lalondes, who are moving to Short Hills, N.J., expect to be no less careful when they buy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHART: A Possible Trough: In some cities, like Cleveland, Boston and San Francisco, home prices increased slightly in May a possible signal that the market has bottomed.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes in the United States posted their largest monthly gain in nearly eight years in June, the government reported on Monday, a sign that the housing market is bottoming as buyers take advantage of lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that sales of new single-family homes rose 11 percent in June; economists' expected a 3 percent increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted rate of 384,000 a year, the highest level since November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the figures offered no sign that the housing market had returned to health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the monthly increase, sales of new homes were still down 21 percent from June 2008. The market is still swamped by a glut of for-sale houses. And new homes, facing competition from cheap foreclosures, are sitting on the market for close to a year before they sell, compared with a median time of six months on the market in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are still really bad numbers,'' an economist at IHS Global Insight, Patrick Newport, said. ''The market just couldn't have dropped much further.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with June 2008, sales of new homes fell 11 percent in the Northeast, were down 10 percent in the West and plunged more than a third in the South. New-home sales were up only in the Midwest, by 6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As sales rose in June, median prices of new homes continued to fall, slipping to $206,200, from $232,100 a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures were the latest evidence that a three-year slump in the country's housing market was leveling off as prices fell back and some builders and buyers began to step tentatively back into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, the government reported that housing starts rose 3.6 percent in June from a month earlier, and a trade group reported that sales of previously owned homes also rose for another month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sales are picking up a little,'' a senior economist at 4Cast, David Sloan, said. ''Whether it's going to pick up any momentum is really the key. I think we have to be doubtful about that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect prices to continue to slide, weighed down by heavy supplies, competition from distressed sellers and tepid demand from potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Prices will continue to edge lower at the bottom end of the market even as demand for these homes picks up a bit,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, wrote in a research note. ''And conditions remain brutal in the middle and upper ranges of the spectrum, with rising unemployment and prices that are still considerably too high in many markets being major impediments to gains in activity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, a closely watched measure of home prices will be released, offering some hints about whether the long plunge in housing values is abating. Economists are expecting a 17.9 percent year-over-year decline in prices in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller Home Price Index of 20 major metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although new-home sales have risen for three months, many economists worry that rising unemployment, stagnant wages and continued tightness in lending markets will weigh down the housing market for the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's still worries that the lack of employment growth and lack of wage growth is restraining consumer income, and that's going to ensure that the recovery is quite modest,'' Mr. Sloan said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction was started on more new homes in June than in any month since November, the Commerce Department said Friday, a signal that the housing market was improving despite a mixed outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts unexpectedly rose last month by 3.6 percent, to 582,000 units, a solid gain from 562,000 units in May and far more than the 532,000 figure that economists had forecast. The gains were concentrated in construction starts on single-family homes, which increased 14 percent for the biggest rise since December 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing permits in June, a measure of forward-looking builder confidence, posted an 8.7 percent increase, the largest gain in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said such a bounce was overdue after housing starts in April reached their lowest level in 17 years. Throughout the economy, inventories of commodities, retail goods and now housing appear to be reaching minimal levels where demand may start to exceed supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts said low mortgage rates during the spring and federal tax credits for homebuyers played a role in fueling the demand for new housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New home buyers have been helped into the market,'' said Celia Chen, a housing economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''I think they're building in advance of when that tax credit expires.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal program, which offers an $8,000 tax credit to first-time home buyers, is set to end on Dec. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the housing market faces considerable obstacles in its efforts to revive. Among them are foreclosures, which have been rising. ''Foreclosures are the one part of the economy that's getting worse right now,'' said Patrick Newport, United States economist at IHS Global Insight. ''Everywhere else the negative numbers are at least getting smaller every quarter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the housing difficulties, builders, especially of condominiums and apartments, are continuing to struggle to find financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that market all but frozen, Mr. Newport said, builders can no longer tap into what was once a source that provided a quarter of the construction financing for apartment complexes and condo units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, construction starts for multifamily units fell more than 25 percent last month, the Commerce Department said Friday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACON, Ga. -- H. Averett Walker used hot money to turn Security Bank from a sleepy Southern lender into a regional powerhouse. Darrell D. Pittard used hot money to jump-start his brand-new MagnetBank, allowing it to lend hundreds of millions of dollars even though it did not have a single drive-up window or even a customer with a checking account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a formula being replicated at banks across the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than simply wooing local customers, they have turned to out-of-state brokers who deliver billions of dollars in bulk deposits, widely known as ''hot money,'' from investors nationwide. In fast-growing regions like this one in central Georgia, the money produced record bank profits and financed whole new communities, built at a phenomenal rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the hot money also came with a high cost. To lure the money from brokers, banks typically had to offer unusually high rates. That, in turn, often led them to make ever riskier loans, leaving them vulnerable when the economy collapsed. Magnet failed early this year and Security Bank is barely hanging on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though few people have heard of it, hot money -- or brokered deposits, as it is also known in the industry -- is one of the primary factors in the accelerating wave of failures among small and regional banks nationwide. The estimated cost to the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> over the last 18 months is $7.7 billion, and growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hot money has bedeviled regulators for three decades and they are starting to fight back, albeit tentatively, devising new restrictions to keep the practice from taking more banks down. But in one of the hidden lobbying battles in Washington this year, the banks are pushing hard to keep the money flowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far the banks are winning, and the hot money continues to fuel bank growth. The industry has even invented variants to get around the few rules that have been put in place by regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks defend the use of brokered deposits as an important tool to bring in money to help communities grow. But even some industry executives acknowledge that certain banks became too dependent on the deposits, and that this abuse caused banks to fail. The consequences can be seen across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 79 banks that have failed in the United States over the last two years had an average load of brokered deposits four times the national norm, according to an analysis performed for The New York Times by Foresight Analytics, an industry research firm based in California. And a third of the failed banks, the analysis shows, had both an unusually high level of brokered deposits and an extremely high growth rate -- often a disastrous recipe for banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data also shows that the problem isn't likely to go away. The 371 still-operating banks on Foresight's ''watch list'' as of March held brokered deposits that, on average, were twice the norm. Even this year, in the depth of the recession, a number of struggling banks have been piling up hot money in a desperate effort to survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the same mix -- rapid increases in hot money and heavy lending for risky real estate development -- that brought down many of the savings and loans in the late 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warnings and Resistance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators now acknowledge that they saw the warning signs during the most recent boom, but failed to take aggressive action. ''We went through this golden age of banking and I just think that everybody lost their compass,'' said Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their indifference has been costly. Even brokered deposits are insured, up to $250,000 for each customer account. But once a bank fails, these deposits become an albatross to the F.D.I.C., which often looks for a healthy bank to take over the failed bank. Most new owners refuse to accept the brokered money -- it doesn't bring branches or real customers -- forcing the F.D.I.C. to repay it. The fight over brokered deposits, though far less public than other struggles over the nation's regulatory system, is one of many in Washington that will help determine the shape of industries ravaged by the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make their case, a delegation of nearly 50 Georgia bankers assembled at the F.D.I.C.'s headquarters in May to plead with regulators to ease restrictions on brokered deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a bullet to their head,'' Joe Brannen, president of the Georgia Bankers Association, recalled members of the group telling senior agency officials. ''This is insanity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokered deposits, industry players and regulators agree, are not inherently a bad thing. Many institutions have relied on brokered deposits for years without troubles. Without brokered deposits, small regional banks in fast-growing parts of the country would not have been able to keep up with the demand for construction loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brokers receive much of the money from investment firms like <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, which are looking to park high-interest certificates of deposits they have sold to clients. Merrill customers get two things out of the arrangement: high returns on their investments and a haven because the money is placed in a bank insured by the F.D.I.C. One brokerage firm, Finance 500, in Irvine, Calif., started a hot money program in 1997 with seven bank customers. A decade later, it delivered $14 billion to more than 1,500 banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the money is volatile. It can be easily shifted from one bank to another as brokers seek the highest interest rates. Thus the term hot money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some banks prosper by supplementing their accounts with these deposits, but try not to rely too much on them because the interest payments are high and the brokers can be fickle. ''It's simple, really,'' Michael Hobbs, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">First Commercial Bank</span> in Missouri wrote to the F.D.I.C. late last year, in defending the industry's practices. ''If brokered deposits are managed accordingly, they provide a safe alternative funding source.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But William M. Isaac, chairman of the F.D.I.C. from 1981 to 1985, said he became wary nearly three decades ago after watching the spectacular fall of Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City, which had grown astronomically by gorging on brokered deposits. Alarmed by the practice, Mr. Isaac moved to eliminate F.D.I.C. insurance for most brokered deposits -- a rule that provoked an industry revolt and was ultimately overturned. Congress later made a similar attempt, but it too was defeated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a lot of scars on my back,'' Mr. Isaac said in an interview, recalling the fight over the rules. ''I don't have any doubt that tens of billions were lost in the S.&amp; L. crisis because of brokered deposits. And we were on our way to shutting that practice down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 1991, Congress prohibited weak banks from obtaining brokered deposits unless they were adequately capitalized. But because approximately 97 percent of the banks in the United States are considered ''well capitalized,'' the limit has little impact. Three years later, the F.D.I.C. watered down that rule by repealing the requirement that banks looking to grow rapidly with brokered deposits seek special permission from the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Frenzy in Georgia</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risks and rewards of brokered deposits played out visibly here in Georgia, where a red-hot real estate market in metropolitan Atlanta drove a lending frenzy that was heavily financed by hot money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pittard built MagnetBank solely on brokered deposits, eschewing even traditional branches. ''It was very simple,'' he said. ''It was clean.'' And the F.D.I.C. approved it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank was chartered in Utah, but did much of its lending in Georgia. When the real estate market here turned in 2007, many borrowers fell behind and Magnet began to crumble. Its failure in January 2009 cost the F.D.I.C. an estimated $129 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Magnet is the extreme example: 100 percent of its deposits were brokered. The story of Security Bank is more typical of the risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years it stayed out of the brokered deposit trade. Mr. Walker, its president and chief, who was known to everyone here in Macon as Rett, bragged to the newspaper about how much he valued local customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The more accounts they have with you -- from a child's savings account to a safety deposit box -- the more loyal the customer is and less likely to leave,'' Mr. Walker said in 2001, the same year he dressed up in a tuxedo shirt and jacket, jeans and boots to cook up a quail dinner for employees at a branch that had met a sales goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as he spoke, suburban Atlanta was booming, and Security wanted to take advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It bought small banks to ramp up its lending. But that did not satisfy its ambitions, government records show. So, despite Mr. Walker's faith in small depositors, Security called the brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the start of the decade, Security held just $693,000 in brokered deposits. By last year it had $798 million, or 33 percent of its overall deposit base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It transformed the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To attract the wholesalers, Security had to offer interest rates that, as of 2007, averaged 5.28 percent, or 20 percent higher than what local banking customers got.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To generate the profits to pay such rates, Security began concentrating its lending in the riskiest corners of the market: acquisition of raw land and construction of housing developments. These loans can bring higher profits from fees and higher interest rates. In 1999, construction lending was 8 percent of Security's loan portfolio. By 2007, it peaked at 53 percent, including prominent projects like converting 230 acres of a former plantation into an upscale new neighborhood called the Highlands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a while, the hot money strategy seemed to be working; Security's profits soared, as did its stock price. Then the economy went sour. Now Mr. Walker has been forced out of his job, and the bank acknowledges it is struggling to survive. It built itself a sprawling new headquarters here in Macon, but it is no longer putting its name atop the tower. Instead, it is trying to find someone to lease the empty space. The Highlands project, like many others it financed, sits unfinished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas D. Woodbery, the bank's senior vice president, defended the strategy as a ''proven and reliable'' way to get more money for loans. But he said the bank was now reducing its allowance on brokered deposits -- under orders from the F.D.I.C., which only in April placed heavy restrictions on Security by issuing a cease-and-desist order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through this hot-money explosion, the regulators largely watched from the sidelines, offering warnings at times, but declining to intervene forcefully, officials in Washington now acknowledge. The F.D.I.C. allowed many banks that lost their ''well capitalized'' status to keep taking brokered deposits, approving waivers for about 65 percent of the applicants over the last five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Don't get in the way, don't take away the punch bowl,'' Ms. Bair said, describing the approach taken by regulators, including her own agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulation Battles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, part of the Treasury Department, bank examiners in 2005 found that ANB Financial of Arkansas relied heavily on brokered deposits to fuel rapid growth, an audit shows. Yet the regulators did not take ''forceful action'' for two more years, the audit says, just before ANB was shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Office of Thrift Supervision -- a Treasury agency that President Obama wants to eliminate -- regulators advised BankUnited of Coral Gables, Fla., to backdate financial records, allowing it to continue to lure brokered deposits, the department's inspector general reported in May 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, even some brokers became concerned about the dependence on hot money that certain banks had developed, said Paul T. Clark, an industry lawyer in Washington. They shared those concerns with regulators at the F.D.I.C. last year, hoping to head off a crackdown. ''We looked at this and we were very nervous,'' he said. ''We are going to get blamed because these banks failed. It is not our fault. Where were the regulators?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking back on the reluctance to slow the growth, Timothy W. Long, chief national bank examiner in the comptroller's office, asked: ''When do you tap on the brakes versus slamming on the brakes? It is a hard thing to do sometimes, particularly when management is pushing back hard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year, the F.D.I.C. proposed a new rule. Banks that rely too heavily on brokered deposits to accelerate their growth will have to pay a higher insurance premium to help cover losses if they fail. The proposed limit was 10 percent brokered deposits and a growth rate of 20 percent over four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as it did in the early 1980s, industry opposition emerged almost overnight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Brokered' is not a 4-letter word!'' Dennis M. King, chief credit officer of North County Bank in Washington State, wrote in one of hundreds of letters the agency received condemning Ms. Bair's plan. ''They are especially important to community banks in our present economic environment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks won important concessions. The regulator relaxed the part of the rule that required higher premiums if banks grew too fast with brokered deposits, allowing a growth rate of up to 40 percent over four years. And it left open a loophole that lets banks -- even those considered unsound -- turn to a ''listing service,'' a source of hot money by another name. Instead of paying a broker, banks pay to subscribe to an electronic bulletin board of credit unions with money to park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One listing service, QwickRate, based in Marietta, Ga., has just 18 employees crammed into a tiny second-floor office. But it delivered $1.6 billion in hot money to banks in May, up from $450 million last May. The growth is coming partly because banks on the edge of failure are coming to the service for a lifeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank regulators are just learning how popular these unregulated services have suddenly become -- and are already worried that they will be the next source of hot money abuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bair said she planned to ask Congress for greater powers to limit the role of hot money in banking -- be it brokered deposits, listing services or simply Internet sales by banks offering unusually high interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have seen the error of our ways,'' she said.</p>
