<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) -- Buyers bought the fewest new homes last year in records going back 47 years, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales for all of 2010 were 321,000, a drop of 14.4 percent from the 375,000 homes sold in 2009, the department said. It was the fifth consecutive year that sales declined after reaching record highs for the five previous years, when the housing market was booming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year ended on a stronger note. Buyers purchased new homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 329,000 units in December, a 17.5 percent increase from the rate in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists say it could be years before sales rise to a healthy rate of 600,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The percentage rise in sales looks impressive,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist at <span class="companylink">High Frequency Economics</span>, but even a large percentage ''of next to nothing is still next to nothing.'' He added, ''New-home sales are bouncing around the bottom, and we see no clear upward trend in the data yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders of new homes are struggling to compete in markets saturated with foreclosures. High unemployment and uncertainty over home prices have kept many potential buyers from making purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices fell in November in 19 of 20 major cities measured by the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index, according to a report released Tuesday, and nine of those cities fell to their lowest point since the housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect prices to keep falling through the first six months of this year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MICHAEL MOSHAN bought his first condo in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 2003. A few years later he persuaded his girlfriend, Shana Liebman, to move there from the West Village. She was skeptical -- she didn't want to be surrounded by 20-somethings just out of school. But over the years the neighborhood, with its restaurants, bars and galleries, grew on her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were married in October 2006, the same month they closed on a condo on Roebling and North Seventh Streets for $725,000. To their surprise, they found a building filled with families. Now they can't imagine raising their 15-month-old son, Nate, anywhere else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you look at child-friendly parts of Brooklyn -- Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn Heights, Park Slope -- those neighborhoods are beautiful and safe and the schools are great and that is good for our kids,'' Mr. Moshan said. ''But is that good for us? We thought, if Williamsburg could mature into a neighborhood where kids can grow, then you've won.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families are discovering that Williamsburg is much more than a playground for the postcollege, skinny-jeans set. The neighborhood has a few private preschools; several indoor play spaces; art, movement and music classes; and a number of children's stores, some of which were started by neighborhood parents. Many of the condo buildings rising all over the neighborhood feature playrooms, pools and other family-friendly amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moshan, 41, a lawyer and a partner in Gold Scollar Moshan, and Ms. Liebman, 36, a freelance writer, are among the converts. Ms. Liebman has found plenty to do with Nate. There's Play, an indoor play center that opened this fall, with its movement and art classes for kids. Nate also loves the children's shows on weekend mornings at the Knitting Factory, the concert hall. Ms. Liebman has met other parents through the Brooklyn Bambino e-mail group. They get together for play dates, coffee, even happy hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Moshans, their building has been the most surprising resource. The five multifamily town houses in the development run side by side for most of a block. In the Moshans' town house, three of the four apartments are occupied by families. They share a nanny and watch one another's children if someone has to run an errand. In the summertime the kids have the run of the sidewalk. And Ms. Liebman has come to know many families in the other town houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can go out in the neighborhood on a Friday night and feel sexy and single-ish,'' Ms. Liebman says with a laugh. ''And then wake up next morning with the kid and take him to the farmers' market and the play center.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many younger single people have been priced out of the neighborhood. The new condo buildings rising on block after block of Williamsburg's north side are a steal compared with Manhattan real estate, but hardly cheap. According to the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, condos in Williamsburg and neighboring Greenpoint sell for an average of $600 a square foot, half the going price of condos in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some of the neighborhood's most expensive buildings, like the Edge, developers are getting as much as $1,000 a square foot for some units. Despite all of the new inventory hitting the market, there is still plenty of demand, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Larger units were developed here as an alternative to higher-priced Manhattan,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Now that the smoke has settled, people can obtain larger living spaces for off-peak prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often those spaces appeal most to families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Lamblin and Jenni Sohn used to live on the Lower East Side in a cramped apartment above a sign shop. It was dark, the kitchen was tiny, and the rooms were often filled with fumes when workers were cutting plastic signs below. With a daughter on the way, they wanted more space, more light, a decent kitchen and fewer toxic fumes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sohn, a multimedia producer for The Associated Press, followed a friend to an open house at Warehouse 11, a development on Roebling and North 11th Streets. She was taken instantly by the corner unit's views of McCarren Park. ''I was so sunlight-deprived, I couldn't believe it when I walked in here and saw floor-to-ceiling windows,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband, an engineer at <span class="companylink">Google</span>, closed on June 28, and their daughter, Sophie, was born the next day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple have already met several parents in the building and noticed a few pregnant neighbors. To accommodate these families, the developer plans to wall off part of the oversized lobby to make a playroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Signer, 47, the director of client services at Harkess-Ord, a brand implementation firm, and his wife, Ayumi Konishi, 45, the owner of Beige Creative, a design and video production studio, were also looking for more space to raise their twins, Miu and Teo. Then living in the financial district, they considered Park Slope, but Mr. Signer was turned off by the brownstone-lined streets and child-friendly restaurants. ''Williamsburg is more industrial, it's closer to Manhattan and we knew people here,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August they moved into a $980,000 three-bedroom at 80 Metropolitan. Through his living-room window, Mr. Signer can see the Domino Sugar factory and the Williamsburg Bridge, partly obscured by the steel beams of new construction -- just the industrial feel he wanted. Miu and Teo share a bedroom and have a separate playroom. Mr. Signer and the twins have met a number of the families at the building's indoor pool. There is talk of starting a swim class for children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are adjusting to these changing demographics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Steiner, the developer of 80 Metropolitan, has already combined several apartments to make six three-bedroom units for buyers, and he can create another seven if need be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change should not be surprising, said David Maundrell, the president of aptsandlofts.com, which is marketing Warehouse 11. Developers first sought singles and couples in their late 20s and early 30s. Many of those people, he says, will eventually have children, and developers are responding with amenities to appeal to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high-end rental building at 184 Kent Avenue has a playroom, as do its high-rise neighbors Northside Piers and the Edge. Mr. Maundrell says that interest in two- and three-bedroom apartments is increasing. Buildings are staging events for parents. For example, 80 Metropolitan is planning a seminar on baby-proofing your home and a talk by Joyce Szuflita, a Brooklyn school consultant. She's finding plenty of business in Williamsburg these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The influx of families can be seen in the growth of Williamsburg Northside Preschool, which opened as a day care center in 1999. By 2002 there were eight classrooms of children. In 2009 it added two classrooms for children 3 months to 2 years old. Now they've expanded to five daycare classes and have a wait list. The school, which now goes through the first grade, plans to expand through the fifth grade and to grow into a third building by 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I never thought that we'd be able to inhabit two buildings and be full and have a wait list,'' said Amy Warden, the school's director. These days, she says, the parents of her students are more affluent than they were. Years ago, nearly all the preschool's graduates went on to local public schools. Now, nearly half go on to private school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Szuflita says that neighborhoods like Park Slope and Carroll Gardens have had good public schools for decades, and that Williamsburg's schools are improving, in part because parents are becoming increasingly involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Park Slope, at the highly regarded Public School 321 in the school year ending in 2009, 92 percent of the fourth graders tested met standards in English and 95 percent in math. At P.S. 132 in Williamsburg, 85 percent met standards in both English and math. At P.S. 34 in Greenpoint, 86 percent met standards in English and 97 percent in math. These numbers compare with statewide averages of 77 percent in English and 87 percent in math.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eve and Rich Kessner left the West Village for Park Slope with their daughter, Avi, last March. But after six months, they found themselves looking for a new place to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It felt really suburban to me,'' said Ms. Kessner, 29, a jewelry designer and blogger. ''Park Slope has puppets and guitar strumming for kids. In Williamsburg, it is like rock 'n' roll for kids.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple bought a two-bedroom corner unit in the Edge, two towers on Williamsburg's waterfront, and moved in at the end of December. They have already become accustomed to the building's long list of amenities for adults and children: a full-size indoor basketball court where Avi likes to kick balls around with Ms. Kessner; a swimming pool and a separate shallow pool for children (another of Avi's favorites); a screening room; a gym; and a large playroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent morning at the Kessners' new place, two workers were busy moving the couch and side tables into place while Avi brushed ink on a piece of paper and, almost instantly, onto the rug. A barge could be seen from the window, making its way up the East River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We really felt like this was the right spot, with all the bars and restaurants,'' said Mr. Kessner, 29, the owner of New York Floorman and New York Paintman, home improvement companies. ''We love it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That mix works for many parents. Ms. Sohn says that galleries have welcomed her and baby Sophie. Mr. Signer says that he is glad not every restaurant is child-oriented. He goes out to eat for the quality of the food, he said, not to take a census of how many highchairs a restaurant owns. For Ms. Liebman, the constant stream of good new restaurants has been an important part of what makes the neighborhood work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are so many restaurants and bars,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''Every time you open Time Out we're like, really? Another restaurant?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there is a flip side. Not every restaurant has room for strollers and highchairs. The area's bars and clubs can rock into the wee hours. Mr. Moshan says that the residents of his building are not happy with a bar that plays loud music in the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that a place like Williamsburg shuts down for the winter. Late one recent night, Mr. Moshan heard the sound of people shoveling snow in the yard of a row house behind his building. They were clearing a space so that they could go outside to drink and smoke. Mr. Moshan worried that they would wake his sleeping son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm staring at them,'' he said, ''thinking how can I get them to stop? Then I think, what the hell happened to me? Am I that guy that wants the kids to get off his lawn?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A little noise now and then is the price you have to pay, Mr. Moshan said. ''That's the neighborhood. It's not Park Slope.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Richard H. Rothman moved into his two-bedroom condominium at the Centurion, a high-rise on West 56th Street designed by Pei Partnership Architects, he discovered to his dismay that the walls had been primed but not painted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $3.5 million, he said, he had expected a condo with fully painted walls. But he learned he didn't have a legal leg to stand on. The developer had stated in the offering plan that nothing beyond primer would be applied to the walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was stuck having to hire a painter to paint a brand-new 1,300-square-foot apartment,'' said Dr. Rothman, a surgeon and professor from Philadelphia. ''The apartment wasn't cheap, and the painter wasn't cheap.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Might he have avoided the situation before the purchase by skimming the hundreds of pages in the condo's offering plan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think anybody in the United States reads that document,'' Dr. Rothman said, ''and I don't think the lawyers read it either. Quite frankly, nobody had pointed it out to me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A title insurance company is now starting to make such plans more accessible -- if not shorter -- by digitizing them and making them available free online. The simplest option for owners or prospective buyers wishing to see plans is to request them through the building's sponsor or managing agent. It can take several days to make a copy, and cost hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, TitleVest Agency Inc., began the service in October and has more than 2,000 offering plans and amendments for condos and co-ops, most of them in New York City. The online library continues to grow daily, said Brian D. Tormey, an executive vice president of TitleVest. Mr. Tormey said he expected another 2,000 to be added soon. He built the library collaboratively with Bill Baron, TitleVest's president, and other TitleVest employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tormey said he had at first thought TitleVest would have to buy the offering plans. But it turned out that law firms, managing agents, real estate brokers and others were only too thrilled to hand over the bulky plans for digitization, since they can end up filling entire storage rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The offering plan for the Centurion is not yet available, but TitleVest is offering to pay $50 toward the purchase of any plan, which it would then digitize. The digitized versions are searchable by keyword. ''Our functionality allows the review and the finding of key terms, in a stack of paper that's a foot high, happen like that,'' Mr. Tormey said, snapping his fingers. ''It's nearly instantaneous, and it really speeds up things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, a lawyer, a property owner or a potential buyer can use the term ''kilowatt-hour'' to find the estimated power bill for an apartment, or ''tax abatement'' to confirm a building has a certain tax break promised by a real estate agent, Mr. Tormey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said having the plans at your fingertips would be especially empowering if the New York City real estate market heated up and buyers felt pressure to speed up due diligence before a competing buyer closed the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Rather than holding up the contract signing with issues of acquiring the plan,'' he said, ''now within an hour of saying, 'I need the offering plan,' you have the offering plan in hand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, however, that recent amendments might make it take longer for TitleVest to deliver an offering plan. With each request, TitleVest checks with the managing agent to see if there have been any amendments, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TitleVest charges $150, shipping included, for a hard copy of an offering plan and its amendments, but the digital version is currently free. This provides a bit of a deal for apartment sellers, who often bear the $180-to-$300 cost of distributing an offering plan to potential buyers, Mr. Tormey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that while TitleVest hopes to make money on the service, the primary motivations were industry good will and brand recognition. A handful of sponsors have asked TitleVest to handle the entire distribution of a development's offering plan, which is usually the job of the building's managing agent, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil B. Garfinkel, a partner in the law firm Abrams Garfinkel Margolis Bergson who is residential counsel to the Real Estate Board of New York, said he had donated almost eight full boxes of offering plans to TitleVest for its library.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's a pretty cool idea,'' said Mr. Garfinkel, who is planning a presentation on TitleVest for the real estate board. ''I had offering plans all over the place, and I was happy to send them, especially with the opportunity that if you ever needed to find something, it's searchable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York state attorney general's office, which maintains repositories of offering plans, has been encouraging development of the online library service, Mr. Tormey said. The office did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michele Conte, a senior vice president and associate broker with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said that TitleVest's online library sounded beneficial for the real estate industry, but that buyers should not jettison their real estate lawyers to save money and take on tasks like due diligence by themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Very few laymen are going to be able to understand what's written in an offering plan,'' Ms. Conte said. ''It's written in legalese.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She suggested instead that buyers provide their lawyer with a list of issues they are most concerned about, so the lawyer has some guidance when reading the offering plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Too many people hire a professional and then just leave it all up them,'' Ms. Conte said, ''and the professional gets blamed when something gets missed.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes things that happen in the world of New York City real estate, even in just one building, are so bizarre that one might wonder: Is this a hallucination?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A meeting between developers of one of the most expensive and contentious condominium conversions in city history grew so heated that one partner hurled a metal ice bucket at the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer hit by the bucket once hired a marching band, with trumpets and tubas drowning out renters who were protesting eviction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bucket-thrower sued the band-hirer, accusing him of using $50 million in condo construction funds for personal and other pursuits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to the Sheffield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in truth, today's Sheffield is not the Sheffield of the ice-bucket-throwing-and-marching-band days of a few years ago. Then called the Sheffield57, the project was plagued by lawsuits, a mountain of debt, defaulted loans, liens on apartments, leaky pipes, unpaid vendors refusing to complete renovations, electrical and elevator problems, and, at one point, the possibility that no oil would be delivered because the heating bills were unpaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a tumultuous history that began in 2005, when three developers riding the wave of the real estate boom bought it for $418 million, one of the highest prices ever paid for a Manhattan residential building, the Sheffield this month marked a milestone that once seemed unthinkable to many: slightly more than 50 percent of its 597 apartments have sold. (Of the 597, 85 are rent-regulated.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both sales and average sale prices picked up sharply in 2010 in the 58-story building, at 322 West 57th Street near Eighth Avenue, after a dismal 2009 in which only 11 units sold. One reason for that was a sales freeze ordered by Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo in May 2009, because the condo offering plan had expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartments went back on the market last March, and between then and the end of 2010, 78 units sold. Prices in the last quarter averaged $1.57 million, close to or surpassing average prices of the precrash days, according to Jacqueline Urgo, the president of the Marketing Directors, which took over sales and marketing of the building last March. So far in January, 8 units have sold, Ms. Urgo said; that brings the total to 357 since the apartments were first listed in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sheffield was one of the best-selling condos of last year as measured by the volume of closings, according to StreetEasy.com, and The Real Deal magazine called it the ''best back-from-the-dead residential project'' of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average prices range from $700,000, for studios, to $7.5 million for four-bedroom apartments; the new marketing team reduced asking prices by as much as 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team has also added a new amenity, matching buyers with stylists from <span class="companylink">Saks Fifth Avenue</span>, who can conduct couture and closet consultations, catalog shoes and ''develop lifelong relationships'' with residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of sales in 2010 was much slower than before the fall of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, according to data from StreetEasy, which showed 81 sales in the first quarter of 2008 alone. But to people like Larry Wagner, who bought a two-bedroom in 2007 - drawn to the building because the two top floors were to contain many amenities, including a gym and spas for both people and pets - it is stunning that the Sheffield's odyssey now looks anything like a resurrection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a complete disaster,'' said Mr. Wagner, a financial consultant. ''It could have really gone south.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sheffield was certainly not alone in its troubles in the wake of the housing crisis. A raft of new developments and conversions faced major financing troubles and slack - or halted - sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sheffield's developers, including Kent M. Swig, a scion of the San Francisco real estate family (and the target of the ice bucket) and Yair Levy (who pleaded guilty in the ice-bucket attack and served two days of community service) had unveiled ambitious plans in 2005 to convert the 853-unit rental building, built in 1978, into luxury condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(A third developer, Serge Hoyda, later joined Mr. Levy in suing Mr. Swig over the $50 million in construction funds.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the spring of 2009 Mr. Swig defaulted on the project's $400 million mortgage and on an additional $240 million in mezzanine debt. A few months later the <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group</span>, the only bidder on the building at a foreclosure auction, took control of the Sheffield. ''The relationship with Fortress could not be any more different than it was with Swig,'' said Robert J. Braverman, a lawyer for the condominium association. ''Fortress has worked with the unit owners to address the problems left behind - huge, multimillion-dollar shortfalls in the reserve fund, an entirely inadequate plan to build out the amenity space, millions in debt owed to condo owners and really shoddy management.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the bills and debts are paid, Mr. Braverman said, and construction is to begin soon on the spa and gym.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Swig, whose real estate empire has been in jeopardy, negotiated a revenue-sharing arrangement with Fortress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortress declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a written statement, Mr. Swig's company, Swig Equities, said: ''We take great pride that the market continues to positively respond to Swig Equities' original vision for the property and to the superb design and construction of the Sheffield residences. With over $500 million of apartments sales completed, $400 million of which were completed under Swig Equities' efforts, we look forward to sharing in the financial success of the Sheffield with Fortress.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Groundbreaking on new homes fell more than expected in December to its lowest in over a year, suggesting the battered housing sector remained a roadblock to a recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in the United States dropped to an annual rate of 529,000 units, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday, down from November's 553,000 and well below forecasts of about 550,000 in a Reuters poll. At current levels, starts account for less than a quarter of their boom-time peaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, building permits soared, a hint of optimism about demand. Permits jumped 16.7 percent to 635,000, far above a median forecast of 560,000 and the biggest jump since June 2008. Changes to state building codes that took effect in January in California, Pennsylvania and New York may have caused builders to rush to seek permits in December, the report said. For example, permits surged 80.6 percent in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, called the housing report ''very disappointing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders went ahead with projects in December to beat the change in building codes, Ms. Lee said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look for a big retracement in January permits,'' she said ''which in turn, is not good news for starts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing was at the epicenter of the worst financial crisis in generations, which began when banks started to take a hit from rising defaults in the mortgage sector in the summer of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevada, Arizona and Florida are among the hardest-hit states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You still have this nagging worry that if housing remains in this kind of uncomfortable equilibrium, it could drag down the consumer and the economy,'' Cary Leahey, economist at Decision Economics in New York, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What little rebound has occurred in housing thus far has been erratic. Applications for home mortgages increased last week as interest rates dipped to their lowest level in a month, an industry group said on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity rose 5 percent in the week ended Jan. 14.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JULIE SATOW </div><div>1054 words</div><div>19 January 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial real estate market is being hobbled by billions of dollars in distressed debt, and some experts are pointing to a provision in many loans -- a so-called bad-boy guarantee -- that they say is to blame for a large part of the backlog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In previous down cycles, when the market was readjusting after a boom, real estate companies would declare bankruptcy to extricate themselves from troubled deals. This time around, many commercial mortgages included provisions that held developers personally liable for the loan if their companies filed for bankruptcy. As a result, foreclosures, in which the competing interests of many parties often play out in lengthy court battles, are now typical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because of the bad-boy guarantees, we have unquestionably had far fewer bankruptcies then we would have had, and than we saw in the 1990s,'' said David M. Neff, a co-chairman of the hotels and leisure practice at the law firm <span class="companylink">Perkins Coie</span>, who is based in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad-boy guarantees, also known as springing guarantees, began appearing in the 1980s, but it was not until the early 1990s that they became conspicuous. ''In the last down cycle in the 1990s, lenders would go to foreclose on a property, and the day before, the borrower would suddenly file for Chapter 11,'' said Raymond N. Hannigan, a partner in the New York law firm Herrick, Feinstein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders began insisting on the provisions to prevent Chapter 11 filings, which they disliked for, among other reasons, the protections they afforded borrowers, the costly litigation involved and the fact that decisions were often up to the whims of a judge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while foreclosures -- in which the developer typically hands over a property's keys and walks away -- have been considered preferable to bankruptcies, many borrowers and even some lenders are now having second thoughts. This is because many commercial loans that originated in the recent boom involved a multitude of lenders with competing interests. Getting these parties to agree in a foreclosure process has been difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a bankruptcy, on the other hand, distressed properties can be sold without the lenders agreeing unanimously. ''Thus you avoid the holdout problem and individual creditors engaging in brinkmanship trying to get the best deal for themselves,'' said Gregg L. Weiner, a partner in the law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson who represents many borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, $61.5 billion in commercial mortgage bonds were delinquent, the highest amount ever recorded, according to the research firm Trepp. With billions of dollars in troubled loans that must be resolved through restructurings, bankruptcies or foreclosure actions, some commercial real estate experts say that borrowers are likely to mount pressure to overturn bad-boy guarantees to pave the way for additional Chapter 11 filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If lenders are logical and would rather resolve issues instead of litigate, then they will consider ways to modify the constraints that their borrowers may have originally agreed to,'' said Michael Pomeranc, a developer and a partner in the Thompson Hotel Group, who has signed several loan documents that included bad-boy guarantees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the market crash, some lenders have engaged in a game of ''extend and pretend'' with troubled developers, where they extend their loan agreements past the maturity dates to keep them from defaulting in the hope that the economy will improve and the loans will be repaid. As a consequence, the loans are not recorded as distressed though they may be in fact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting this year, many extensions will expire and ''lenders are going to have to finally work out these loans and as a result, bad-boy guarantees are going to come under much more scrutiny,'' said William M. O'Connor, a partner in the law firm <span class="companylink">Crowell &amp; Moring</span>, who represents borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of the guarantees say lenders have handcuffed borrowers by expanding the provisions beyond their original intent. ''While the bad-boy guarantees were originally intended to focus on truly bad-boy acts, over time lenders couldn't help themselves,'' Mr. Weiner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one recent case, ING Real Estate Finance and Swedbank sued the developers of a stalled Midtown hotel and condominium project over a $145 million loan. The developers, Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs, whose RFR Holding owns Lever House and the Seagram Building, took out the loan with their partners in 2007 to build a 64-story <span class="companylink">Shangri-La Hotel</span> at 610 Lexington Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2009, the hotel project had stalled and they were late paying a $278 million real estate tax bill. They paid the lien 19 days later, but the lenders asserted that the delay had activated the bad-boy guarantee and that they had to pay millions of dollars in penalties from their personal accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The judge, who expressed incredulity at the terms of the guarantee, dismissed the claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the vast majority of cases involving guarantees, the judges have ruled that they can be enforced. Perhaps the most visible case involved the Blue Hills Office Park in Canton, Mass. The developer was accused of transferring $2 million into an account and failing to notify the lender of the funds. The lender successfully sued the company's principals for $10.77 million under the bad-boy guarantee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These court cases are nothing more than ''borrowers trying to change the rules of the game in midstream,'' said Mark Weibel, a partner in the law firm <span class="companylink">Thompson &amp; Knight</span> who is based in Dallas and represents lenders. ''It is borrowers who are not complying with their loan documents -- this is what is causing the mire.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a growing number of market players say that something must be done to allow bankruptcies to go forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These guarantees can be an impediment to getting a sensible restructuring of commercial real estate loans,'' said Andrew A. Lance, a partner in the law firm <span class="companylink">Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher</span> who represents both borrowers and lenders. ''We either need an alternative way to properly incentivize borrowers or get clarity that servicers can waive guarantees without risk of being sued.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HILLSBORO, Ore. -- Intel was never one of those technology companies where employees had beanbag chairs, designer desks and pinball machines. Its offices were known for their endless rows of gray cubicles, low ceilings and fluorescent lighting. For decades it resisted any changes to its office environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last two years, however, Intel has quietly been trying to inject a little more fun into its offices and make them places where employees can be more collaborative. The company has remade one million square feet of office space thus far in a sweeping redesign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its campus here outside of Portland, where it designs computer chips, gray walls have been repainted yellow, purple and white, cubicle walls are lower so employees can be seen, and lounges have been outfitted with flat-screen TVs, armchairs and sleek kitchens that would not look out of place in a design magazine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes are being made for more than cosmetic reasons. To promote innovation, Intel wanted to create plenty of space where people could work in groups, rather than be isolated at their desks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Tunmore, the director of corporate services at Intel, who oversees the company's 30 million square feet of office space, said, ''We realized that we were inefficient and not as collaborative as we would have liked.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As employees become more mobile and less tied to their desks, the average amount of space per employee nationwide, in all industries, has dropped to 250 square feet from 400 square feet in 1985, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, a commercial brokerage and property manager. Within 10 years, that is expected to drop further, to 150 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The office status symbol seems not to be as important. People are living for more flexibility in their lives,'' said Peter Miscovich, a managing director for corporate solutions at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By allotting less space per person, companies can squeeze more employees -- sometimes double or triple as many -- onto a floor. One newly redesigned floor of Intel's campus can now accommodate 1,000 people, up from 600. In some departments where employees are often on the road, two people may be assigned to a desk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, sometimes the downsizing in office space is not voluntary. Companies that went through rounds of layoffs are renegotiating leases, moving into smaller offices and mothballing large real estate projects to save money. In the last three years, companies have given up 137.8 million square feet nationwide, according to the real estate research firm Reis, and would most likely put more on the market if they could. Other companies are reducing their real estate expenses, which are generally the second-largest cost after employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many companies are redesigning the workplaces that remain, opening them up to make them flexible for multiple uses. Even tradition-bound firms in accounting and banking are embracing open-plan offices and other changes. They have shut sections of floors to save money on utilities, squeezed remaining employees closer together, torn down walls and downsized cubicles or gotten rid of them entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Companies that were dragging their feet changed their minds with the bottom line,'' said Richard Kadzis, a spokesman for CoreNet Global, an association of real estate executives in Atlanta. ''Now that we're on the other side of the recession, companies are asking themselves, 'How do we be smarter?' Cost has driven traditional companies to free the reins.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accounting and consulting company Deloitte is trimming real estate costs at its San Francisco offices. Deloitte terminated a lease there five years early even though it carried a $12 million penalty and required a move. Its new landlord is paying part of the fee, according to the CoStar Group, a commercial real estate firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its new San Francisco office, at 555 Mission Street, which opens this year, employees have less personal space and there are more community areas where accountants can meet clients. At nearly 182,000 square feet, the office is about 100,000 square feet smaller than the previous one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saving money, though, is not the only reason to downsize. Opening up an office makes people interact more and, the thinking goes, be more productive. It also makes it possible to eliminate some seldom-used desks or turn them into shared work spaces. Around 60 percent of a company's desks are vacant at one time, according to CoreNet Global, because workers are either on the road or in meetings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're getting the Swiss cheese out of spaces,'' said Keith Perske, the president of Group 5 Consulting, a workplace consulting company in Austin, Tex. ''It makes you feel more loyal to a company if there's some energy or buzz'' in the work space. <span class="companylink">Sabre Holdings</span>, a travel services firm that owns Travelocity.com, redid its headquarters in Southlake, Tex., near Dallas, four years ago. It consolidated 2,800 people into two buildings from five, eliminated its offices and desktop computers and added ''jump-in'' rooms for private conversations and phone calls. Everyone, including the chief executive, now works out of shared cubicles with laptops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renovations will save the company about $10 million per year, and Sabre is now introducing the changes at its offices around the world. At its 30,000-square-foot location in Buenos Aires, for example, it used many of the lessons it learned from its headquarters move. Realizing that the company would outgrow its space there before its lease expired -- and not wanting to lease a second building at an estimated $200,000 a year -- managers imposed the same changes as at the Texas offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a radical break can disorient employees, experts say. ''You need to give people three months to adjust, '' said Chris Fernandez, director of facilities at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, who helped oversee Sabre's changes. ''You get a lot of complaining but once they get accustomed to that environment, some of that noise starts to die off.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intel has also run into some resistance. When the real estate executives wanted to get rid of the ''gray on gray on gray'' color scheme, engineers complained. Light colors, they said, would show dirt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I told them the dirt was already there, we'd now see it and clean more often,'' said Russ Heinsen, Intel's general manager in corporate services, programs and training in Hillsboro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last two years, <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> has been trimming excess space as leases expire, and introducing a telecommuting policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This June, <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> opened its first tPlace, a flexible workspace with on-demand desks and videoconferencing, for its employees who live north of Dallas. The 4,000-square-foot space allows people to work closer to their homes and saves the company money: up to 25 percent of its employees did not have to move downtown to its new offices. It plans to open as many as five tPlaces in the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For every square foot we shed, we save a few dollars,'' said Mark Schleyer, senior vice president for corporate real estate at <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office furniture makers have seized on the workplace changes and have been offering products that can be reconfigured for individuals or groups. In June, <span class="companylink">Steelcase</span> introduced several products, including an electronic room-scheduling device, flexible walls and a long desk where people can sit and work side by side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of thinking about the office has changed. The work setting was a reflection of your status,'' said Jim Keane, the president of <span class="companylink">Steelcase</span>. ''A job focuses more on collaboration than on the individual now.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a gala dinner next month, the developers Peter L. and Anthony E. Malkin are the leading contender for a Pinnacle Award, the real estate equivalent of a Golden Globe, for their $81 million renovation of a building across West 34th Street from <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But their moment of glorious anticipation is being undercut by a lawsuit brought by another developer, Charles Cohen, whose company happens to own the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cohen said the Malkins, who lease the building, had no right to affix a new glass facade to the 26-story building, at 112 West 34th, and to try to glamorize the narrow entrance with marble and an undulating 30-foot-high ceiling. The Malkins' W&amp;H Properties, according to the lawsuit in State Supreme Court, had failed to get Mr. Cohen's permission for those structural changes, as required by a lease dating to 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cohen wants the ancient lease terminated and the Malkins out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In concept, this dispute is not all that different from when a landlord tries to evict a tenant for unauthorized alterations, like painting the walls black or installing a washing machine. But in scale, this dispute is much greater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Malkins, a father and son best known for controlling one of the city's architectural symbols, the Empire State Building, have said in court that Mr. Cohen's charges are nonsense, merely a ploy to break the lease. It is easy to see why they want to preserve the lease: It was signed in 1963, lasts until 2077 and sets the current rent at $840,000 a year, a small fraction of what the Malkins receive from the office and retail tenants they have filled the building with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By their actions, it is clear that they believe that they own the building and they can do whatever they want without getting permission from the landlord,'' Steven M. Cherniak, chief operating officer for Cohen Brothers Realty Corporation, said of the Malkins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are a sophisticated tenant, and they have a lease by which they must abide.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extremely long leases are not uncommon in commercial real estate; for example, what gives Larry A. Silverstein the right to build skyscrapers at ground zero is the 99-year lease on the World Trade Center that he signed shortly before the 9/11 attack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But few could have imagined the phenomenal increase in Manhattan property values that would take place in the 47 years after the 34th Street lease was signed. The agreement is so old that neither the Malkins nor the Cohens were involved in signing it, inheriting their positions as tenant and owner through deals their families made in the ensuing years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erected 57 years ago, 112 West 34th was originally known as the Childrenswear Building, with businesses and showrooms in the garment industry. Today, it still has clothing-related tenants, like the corporate headquarters of Aeropostale, but it also has a mix of other businesses, like travel agencies, and nonprofit groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One real estate broker, who requested anonymity for fear of becoming embroiled in the battle, said that if the lease could be renegotiated today, Mr. Cohen could easily get $9.5 million a year, which is more than 10 times what he is getting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In court papers, the Malkins argue that the lease requires them to maintain the building properly, which included replacing a leaky facade wall. Further, they say that they pay all expenses and taxes in connection with the operation of the building, while Mr. Cohen ''does little more than receive the annual rent.'' That may be, but Mr. Cohen's suit contends that the lease specifically states that no structural change or alteration exceeding $100,000 can take place without ''prior written approval.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cohen's lawyer, Warren A. Estis, said he marveled at the Malkins' ''arrogance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the Malkins do not own the building, in news releases in recent years their company said the property was owned by ''a partnership led by'' the Malkins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Malkins weathered a storm of criticism last year for what was portrayed as their high-handed refusal to illuminate the Empire State Building in honor of Mother Teresa's 100th birthday because she was a religious figure -- unlike the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Mariah Carey and others who had been honored in that way. Meanwhile, the Malkins tried unsuccessfully to block another developer from winning city approval to erect a bulky skyscraper on 34th Street that might challenge the Empire State Building's spot on the New York skyline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The adversaries are nothing if not tenacious, and the Malkins have been in this position before, with their signature property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in 1994, Donald J. Trump, as a partner with the family of a shadowy Japanese tycoon, Hideki Yokoi, in owning the Empire State Building, tried to snatch full control of it from the people who had the below-market lease -- the Malkins and their partners, who included Harry B. and Leona Helmsley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump sued to void the lease and oust the Malkins, claiming that in violation of the lease terms, the Empire State Building was overrun with rats and was being poorly managed. Then the Malkins sued, saying Mr. Trump and his partners were engaged in an extortion scheme intended to squeeze money out of the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of litigation, Mr. Trump lost and the Malkins eventually bought the entire property.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first sign that something was amiss with Garfield Gillings's house on Strauss Street in Brownsville, Brooklyn, came in the fall of 2003, when Mr. Gillings called a collection agency to negotiate a payment of outstanding tax and water bills. He was told that the debt had already been paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Who paid it?'' Mr. Gillings remembered asking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You did,'' he was told.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Gillings had not paid the bill, which also removed a city tax lien. A few days later, he performed a title search and discovered that the old brick house, which he had been using as an art studio and storage spot, was no longer his.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somebody had forged his name on a bogus deed, signed the property over to a holding company, then filed papers with the city register. A woman from Long Island was eventually charged with stealing Mr. Gillings's house, along with more than 30 other properties; she is now in prison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the seven years since the house, at 2206 Strauss Street, was stolen, it has been the scene of a fire and a murder, and has gone through various owners. But Mr. Gillings, 53, has not been one of them, having failed to prove his rightful ownership in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like I'm in a perfect storm of corruption,'' he said recently. ''I feel like I'm being buried. Every time I try to get my rights acknowledged, I'm getting pushed back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gillings, a sculptor and painter who earned a modest living buying and selling old records, bought the two-story brick house on Strauss Street from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the early 1980s for $2,500. It was a fixer-upper. There were holes in the roof. There was a kitchen but no sink. And the unfinished basement lacked a boiler. In the winter, Mr. Gillings said, he painted inside the house wearing gloves and a wool hat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He fell behind on real estate taxes and on bills from the New York City Water Board. Eventually, he said, the city turned over an outstanding lien of several thousand dollars to a collection agency, J.E.R. Revenue Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what prosecutors suspect drew the attention of predators who paid the lien and, posing as owners, unlawfully sold the house to an entity they controlled, with the odd name of Beef Patty Breath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That company and others, with names like Boo Boo Realty and G.M.I. Inc., were used by a group of people who, the Brooklyn district attorney's office says, stole more than 30 homes over three years. Maria Leyna Albertina, who prosecutors said was the leader of the group, was indicted in late 2004 on 224 counts of grand larceny, falsifying business records and related charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the spoils, officials said, Ms. Albertina had apparently built a $2 million mansion on Long Island and bought a 34-foot yacht called Miei Tre Bambinis, which was on display outside the news conference announcing her indictment. There, Mr. Gillings told reporters that he was heartbroken because the only house he had ever owned had been stolen from him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Albertina, who was represented by the well-known lawyer Benjamin Brafman, was released on $1 million bail. Eighteen months later she was back in court, charged again with stealing houses in Brooklyn. She pleaded guilty to grand larceny in 2006, but the start of her sentence was delayed with the understanding that she would pay restitution of $2 million. Prosecutors said, however, that she then participated in a $100 million mortgage fraud scheme, in Manhattan. In January 2009, a judge called Ms. Albertina's conduct ''extreme and egregious'' and sentenced her to 5 to 15 years in prison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deed theft and mortgage fraud schemes are notoriously difficult and costly to unravel. The United States attorney's office in Brooklyn and the Brooklyn district attorney's office have created units to deal specifically with fraudulent real estate schemes. But as the house on Strauss Street shows, even a successful prosecution does not guarantee that a victim can go home again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Securing the return of stolen real property is one of the more difficult things to do,'' said Richard Farrell, the head of the real estate fraud unit at the Brooklyn district attorney's office. ''The book is not closed on this office helping Mr. Gillings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Ms. Albertina traveled through the court system, the brick house on Strauss Street became blighted. Warped plywood replaced windowpanes, and an unlocked metal gate covered the broken front door. Thieves plundered the premises, Mr. Gillings said, and workers hired by fraudulent owners threw out many of the artworks that he had kept there. They also removed interior walls, he said, further weakening an already fragile frame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point a heap of rubbish outside the facade ignited, singeing the siding. In 2007, a 22-year-old man was fatally shot in the head while sitting on the stoop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Mr. Gillings was trying to untangle the web of transactions that began when his house was stolen on Sept. 11, 2003. About three weeks later, according to Department of Finance records, the new owners, Beef Patty Breath, sold it for $150,000 to a man named Kamran Badkobeh. Eleven days later, Mr. Badkobeh sold the property for $220,000 to 2206 Realty N.Y. Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a telephone interview, Isaac Katz, who has been identified in court papers as the president of 2206 Realty N.Y., said that when he bought 2206 Strauss Street in 2003 he had no idea the property had been stolen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were victims of this thing, too,'' Mr. Katz said. ''We paid $220,000 and we had to fight our insurance company to get paid back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, Mr. Katz settled a lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general's office that accused 11 people with deceiving members of minority communities in Brooklyn into buying decrepit properties at inflated prices; the house at 2206 Strauss Street was not part of the lawsuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months ago, Mr. Katz said he had turned that house over to Mr. Gillings, although New York City property records indicate that 2206 Realty N.Y. Inc. is still the owner, and city Finance Department records show that the company paid $10,000 in taxes on 2206 Strauss Street in 2010. Mr. Katz said those records were inaccurate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lynn Armentrout, director of the Foreclosure Project at the City Bar Justice Center, said recovering a stolen home was often arduous. Even when there was a criminal trial, owners often must present evidence of the theft in court. They also must sue all purported owners of the stolen property, Ms. Armentrout said, asking the court to eliminate competing claims and restore the deed to the original owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first to sue over 2206 Strauss Street was Mr. Katz, who filed a complaint in 2004 contesting Mr. Gillings's claim of ownership. Mr. Gillings filed a response, asserting that the sale of the property to Mr. Katz had been illegal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No further filings are included in the records of the case maintained at the State Supreme Court building in Brooklyn. Colleen Kerwick, a lawyer who had represented Mr. Gillings pro bono, said Mr. Gillings regained ownership of his house in September 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''His title was restored at that time and he was made aware of this,'' Ms. Kerwick wrote in an e-mail. ''The fraudulent deed was set aside when Albertina was convicted.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Farrell, from the district attorney's office, said that because Ms. Albertina did not acknowledge stealing 2206 Strauss Street by means of a forged deed when she pleaded guilty to other charges in 2006, there was insufficient evidence to automatically restore title to Mr. Gillings as part of the prosecution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Without statement by the defendant or finding by trial jury that the document is a forgery, you've got litigation on your hands,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Mr. Gillings lodged a complaint against Ms. Kerwick with the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court, but the disciplinary committee said she was not at fault. Mr. Gillings said he then grew depressed, and more or less gave up hope of regaining his house. But he recently began looking for a new lawyer to see if he can try again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One recent afternoon, Mr. Gillings pulled up the steel roll-down gate that covered the entrance to 2206 Strauss Street and walked inside for the first time in more than year. Crates of records stood in a hallway, and some of Mr. Gillings's paintings leaned against walls. Layers of plaster, brick and masonry covered the floors, and broken joists rested haphazardly atop mounds of rubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the roof had caved in, and beams of sunlight shone through the gap. A feral cat scurried across debris that covered the staircase to the second floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After gazing for a few minutes at the dilapidated interior Mr. Gillings went back outside and greeted a few old neighbors . He stood on the building's stoop, pained at the wreckage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This was more than a building -- it was a temple where I came to do my work,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A part of my life has been lost. And the people who did it don't care one bit.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT the height of the real estate boom in Manhattan, it seemed a new glass-walled apartment tower was unveiled every week and sold out before the next one even got its Web site up. Now, as the market plods along in a slow but steady recovery, brokers and developers are saying the city will soon face a shortage of new development projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics might be forgiven for snickering at the suggestion that this shortage will spur demand and -- what else? -- drive prices up. But a look at one indicator, the number of building permits filed for new residential units in recent years, might give the doubters pause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, through November, the city issued permits for only 10 new residential buildings, for a total of 505 new units. That's 95 percent fewer apartments, either condo or rental, than for the same period in 2008, when permits were filed for 9,448 units in 147 buildings, according to census data. (The number of units had dropped to 1,203 in 31 buildings in 2009.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We tend to go through these cycles where, when you finally come out of a recession, there's a shortage of inventory,'' said Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens. ''You usually expect the slowdown to come over a couple years, but this was like slamming on the brakes. So to start up again may take awhile.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers, developers and market watchers say that barring any significant economic hiccups, real estate values in Manhattan will continue to grow at a measured rate through 2011. But starting in 2012, after most or all the new projects that were stalled or delayed have finally sold out, the supply of new apartments will take a decided dip, and prices for all apartments could start to rise significantly again. ''Once we work through the existing inventory and there's nothing new coming on line,'' said Kelly Mack, the president of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, ''there's going to be a major shift in the market. Prices may start going up significantly in 2012, in anticipation of the shift in inventory.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heym said that since a permit doesn't always translate into bricks and mortar, many permits from 2008, and even earlier, have yet to turn into buildings that can be sold and occupied. ''There's also the question of how many buildings that were stalled during the downturn are still out there and when they will hit the market,'' he said. ''So there are a lot of unknowns.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Barnett, the president of Extell Development and one of the few developers who continued building through the downturn, said the lack of inventory was more pronounced now than in previous recessions. ''In the early 1990s,'' he said, ''there was a big overhang of things that had been built in the late '80s, but when things stopped this time, it just fell off a cliff.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of building permits ''didn't go from 10,000 to 6,000,'' he added, ''it went from 10,000 to nothing. So we don't have the overhang and no big inventory to work through. That's why the market recovered much more quickly than people expected.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers and developers agreed that the reason for the sudden falloff in building permits was the lack of construction financing. Apartment hunters have had a hard time in the last two years getting a mortgage, but developers have had an even tougher haul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you look at all the traditional players in the condo market, very few have anything under construction because there's just no financing available,'' said Bruce A. Beal Jr., an executive vice president of the Related Companies, which this year is completing a 60-story tower at 42nd Street and 10th Avenue that will have both rentals and condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Mr. Beal and Mr. Barnett acknowledged that a few big projects would open this year but said they could not think of any major developments set to open in 2012. Projects that get under way this year will not be ready for sale until 2013 at the earliest, after inventory has been depleted and just as prices have begun to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Extell started a hotel/condo project on West 57th Street near Carnegie Hall with 136 condo units, which Mr. Barnett said would come to market in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related is planning its mixed-use project at Hudson Yards, and could also start building on a West 30th Street site on the edge of the yards, but Mr. Beal said neither location was likely to produce new apartments until 2013 or 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth S. Horn, the president of Alchemy Properties, which primarily builds condos with fewer than 100 apartments, said that he felt lucky both to have closed on a site in late 2010 and to have obtained a construction loan. ''I've been saying for the last 18 months that now is the time to buy and build,'' he said, ''but the financing just wasn't there. The only reason we could get this loan was through relationships that we had built up over the years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project will be a 23-story tower on 15th Street and Fifth Avenue that will have a school on its lower floors and 57 apartments above. Alchemy will start construction this year and hopes to start selling units in late 2013. ''Who knows if prices will go up in 2013,'' Mr. Horn said, ''but it does stand to reason, on pure supply-and-demand basis. If I can deliver product in 2013, I'll be ahead of the curve. And I would have done more projects if I had been able to convince my other financial partners.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Beal said that although construction financing had been hard to obtain for both rental buildings and condos, he knew of as many as 3,000 planned rental units that could start construction in 2011. ''There are a couple of deals here or there that people have heard about,'' he said, ''but not much in a market that once was producing as many as 10,000 units a year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andy Gerringer, the managing director of the Marketing Directors, said that developers and investors had just recently started buying land again. ''Sites have been trading,'' he said, ''and we've been talking to people who are dusting off plans that have been on the back burner for the last two years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many projects conceived before the downturn are getting a second life, said Howard Lorber, the chairman of Prudential Douglas Elliman. Most have been taken over by new owners and are likely to start construction within the next six months, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have 10 different projects that we're working on,'' he added, ''and none of them have started yet. Let's say only seven of them eventually get done, that's still probably 1,000 units'' that could come to market by 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The handful of buildings that start selling apartments in 2011 are expected to do well, especially in neighborhoods that have little new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, when buyers were signing contracts based solely on floor plans and glossy brochures, more than 8,500 new units hit the market in Manhattan, not including Upper Manhattan neighborhoods, according to data compiled by the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. That number dropped to just 553 units in 2009, when the presale market shriveled up because buyers were loath to invest in properties they could not see or touch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for new developments also peaked in 2009, with a median price of $1.215 million, according to streeteasy.com. Prices continued to rise during the downturn -- even as resale prices dropped -- because many contracts signed before the financial crisis did not close until late 2009. By 2010, the number of new development units had climbed back up to 1,767, but the median price had dropped 13 percent, to $1.059 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mack said she expected only about 600 to 700 new condo units in about a dozen buildings to hit the market this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two big projects include the Aldyn on Riverside Boulevard, a 40-story tower built by Extell and being marketed by Corcoran Sunshine, and Related's 42nd Street tower. At the Aldyn, which is to have 286 rental and condo units, rents will start at $2,695, for a studio, and condo prices will range from $775,000, for a one-bedroom, to $15.9 million for a six-bedroom. The 42nd Street building will start leasing 500 apartments in March, but sales on its 150 condos will not start until later in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity on the rental side will probably be greater, with about 2,500 new rental units expected to open in 2011, said Gary Malin, the president of Citi Habitats, ''but we're not talking about massive construction coming on line.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2011 number includes 900 apartments at 8 Spruce Street, the 76-story tower designed by Frank Gehry; 250 units at Clinton Park, a Two Trees Management project at 53rd Street and 11th Avenue that will eventually have 900 apartments; and 338 units at the Continental, a 53-story tower at Avenue of the Americas and 32nd Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of what's going to come on line this year has been planned for a long time,'' Mr. Malin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durst Fetner Residential recently closed on a failed condo site that will now become a rental building. It plans to break ground in early 2012 on a 40-story rental tower at 855 Sixth Avenue, at 30th Street. The building would have either retail space or a hotel on the lower floors and several hundred apartments above. It would not be completed until 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in the buildings that open this year will most likely start to rise in some areas before others. Emerging neighborhoods like Harlem, the financial district and Downtown Brooklyn still have substantial inventory, and prices will stay stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But about 80 percent of New York City has very little product in it right now,'' Mr. Gerringer said. That doesn't mean a new building can expect to sell 50 units a month, as they used to in 2007 and 2008, ''but those levels weren't real, and a level market is more like 5 to 10 units a month, which is what we've been seeing lately.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several new buildings that have opened downtown, for example, have fared well in recent months. Ms. Mack cited 123 Third Avenue, a 19-story tower at 14th Street that started selling last fall. It sold 70 percent of its 47 apartments in four months, she said, adding that the projects with healthy sales are the ones priced well for their neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gramercy 19 on Third Avenue, a 16-unit condo that Halstead Property started selling last November, sold 12 units in 10 days, said Stephen G. Kliegerman, the executive director of development marketing at Halstead. Four of those sales had bidding wars and sold for about 5 percent above initial asking prices. The range at Gramercy 19 starts at $440,000, for a one-bedroom, and reaches $2.65 million for a three-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That kind of thing isn't happening everywhere and there are always going to be bright spots and lower spots,'' Mr. Kliegerman said. ''But generally, we are seeing good demand almost everywhere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Upper West Side, an area that has historically had little new development, Brown Harris Stevens began sales in December for the Laureate, a 20-story building with 76 apartments. Made up mainly of large apartments with three to seven bedrooms, the building is not yet finished, but interest has been so keen that as of Jan. 1, 600 people had signed a waiting list to see units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kliegerman said that fewer new apartments entering the market ''can be a good thing for the market,'' adding, ''It gives the market time to catch up to itself.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS the high end of the Westchester market shows tentative signs of rallying and the inventory of houses for sale is finally being absorbed, a handful of ''spec'' builders are re-entering the field -- though more cautiously than during the real estate boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the past, I would have built four spec houses at a shot,'' said Joe Simone, the owner of Simone Development in New Rochelle, who in boom times built multimillion-dollar mansions snapped up by sports figures and others with deep pockets. ''Today, maybe I'll do two, and not as elaborate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things aren't as high-flying as they once were,'' he added. ''I got out during the meltdown, and now I'm coming back in a different economy and with a different approach.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A developer of residential and commercial properties, he expects to break ground this spring on two houses in Purchase, one on 1.51 acres, the other on 3.8, each selling for about $3.8 million. By contrast, in 2005 Mr. Simone built estate-style houses on speculation in Bedford, each on four to five acres, that started at $3 million and went as high as $7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the caution stems from the difficulty in securing financing. With banks risk-averse, hedge-fund types and other private investors have begun to fill the void, said David Turner, a sales agent for Houlihan Lawrence in Bedford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The downturn in the market eliminated some of the builders who didn't belong in it in the first place, who weren't experienced enough,'' Mr. Turner said. ''And it is now influencing how the newest group of new spec builders are getting financed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Crowe, the chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, a trade group in Washington, described spec builders as ''generally the little guys who don't build very many homes a year.'' Especially for them, he said, ''financing is no small issue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We see some of those builders coming back now,'' he said, ''but usually only in areas where the housing market has begun to improve.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a two-acre lot in Chappaqua, Estate Services, a two-man development company based in Port Chester, is building a five-bedroom brick house with five baths and two half baths that it plans to list for $3.145 million. In the words of Charles Reis, one of the partners in the 14-year-old company, ''If getting financing for a spec house was difficult before, it's impossible now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his partner, Gilbert Araujo, both from Minas Gerais, Brazil, have taken another route. They have teamed with Barry Delman, an investment banker who owns a house on Heathcote Drive that Estate Services built about nine years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a business venture not related to his job, Mr. Delman was granted approval to subdivide his five-acre property and hired Estate Services to build a house on the newly created lot. The business agreement is that Mr. Delman covers the costs, the developers provide the labor, and all share the profits when the house is sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Briarcliff Manor, Mr. Turner, the real estate agent for Houlihan Lawrence who has the listing for the 65-acre estate of the late philanthropist Brooke Astor, said a number of potential buyers had expressed an interest in developing the property with spec houses. In Bedford Hills, Camille C. Branca, an agent for Ginnel Real Estate, reported that a five-bedroom five-bath house on 11.5 acres, offered at $8.9 million, is also being considered by investors who may buy now with an eye to subdividing later and building spec homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But the market is still slow,'' Ms. Branca said. ''So they're willing to invest in the land, but they are holding off on actual construction. At least in Bedford, we aren't seeing a lot of spec building yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Rye, the spec market has continued mostly unaffected by what is happening elsewhere, reported Nancy Neuman, the manager of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage</span>. The city is a special case, she said, with ''tired older houses on good lots,'' making the area ripe for teardowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in Rye's relatively strong market for spec houses, however, builders still struggle for capital, turning first to private investors or their own savings, said Susan Cappelli, a Rye developer who is putting the finishing touches on a five-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath cedar shake and stone house that is in contract for $2.9 million. Ms. Cappelli's brother is Louis R. Cappelli, who has been active in the redevelopment of downtown White Plains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only time I can go to a bank is when the house is already in contract like this one,'' she said. ''Before then, lending institutions just don't want to take a risk. The economy may be showing signs of improving, but it remains a tricky housing market, no matter where you're working.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Chandan, 37, is the global chief economist for <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a market research firm in Manhattan that tracks commercial real estate sales and trends worldwide. He joined the company about a year ago, after his firm, Real Estate Econometrics, was acquired by Real Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Chandan was also the chief economist for the real estate research company Reis for nearly six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How was your first year at Real Capital?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Fantastic. My entire team came out; I brought six people with me. Real Estate Econometrics provided the perfect complement to the existing expertise of R.C.A., which historically focused on capital markets broadly but specifically on transaction activity. Our team's focus was on how those deals are being financed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q And the commercial property market in New York in 2010?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A The New York office market, in particular, recovered a significant measure of its previous robustness, and the apartment sector performed exceptionally well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of that relates to significant competition on the part of investors. Interest has been largely focused on office because of the visibility -- the tradeability -- of those assets, and on the apartment sector, because of its stronger fundamentals and the availability of credit through government sponsored enterprises like <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Let's get to your preliminary numbers as of last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We had $54.6 billion in transaction activity nationwide in 2009, and that more than doubled over the course of 2010, to $117 billion. New York City was at the leading edge of that balance, with $16.9 billion in transactions last year, up from $6.5 billion in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, office transactions totaled $8.4 billion in 2010, compared with $2.9 billion; apartments totaled $4.3 billion, versus $1.4 billion. Hotel was $1.6 billion, up from $522.3 million; retail, $1.6 billion, up from $946.6 million; and industrial, $1.1 billion, up from $726.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What was the biggest transaction in 2010?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I'll give you a hint: it's an office building. The largest transaction has been the closed sale in December of 111 Eighth Avenue to <span class="companylink">Google</span> as its New York headquarters. The property transacted for $1.8 billion, or $621 a square foot. The next-largest transaction, the McGraw Hill headquarters at 1221 Sixth Avenue, a slightly smaller property, traded at $1.28 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers have played a very significant role. In the case of 1221 Sixth Avenue, the buyer was the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>. For foreigners it's a combination of the attractiveness of the New York market and pressures to diversify outside home markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Foreigners seem to be involved in more than buying properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Take, for example, the Bank of China, which has been providing some significant financing in the New York City area over the last couple of months. There's an argument to be made that new constraints being introduced by the government of mainland China on development activity -- the ability of lenders to finance transactions out of concern that property prices are rising too rapidly in both residential and commercial sectors -- has ultimately meant that large, established lenders in those markets have had to explore opportunities elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q So credit has loosened up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Absolutely. And because credit markets are improving we have the capacity to trade larger and more visible properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What's your outlook for 2011?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We'll continue to see strong momentum in pricing metrics -- whether it be lower cap rates or higher prices per square foot. We'll continue to see that a diversity of lenders in the market will support investors in their eagerness to acquire properties in the apartment and office sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge for us is the potential for interest rates to rise. They have risen over the course of the last couple of months, from their lows in October, in a way that we've been able to absorb. But if they rise in a more significant way, because of geopolitical factors or a change in the monetary policy or investors' tolerance for risk, that has the potential to ultimately drive cap rates in the other direction. Then borrowing costs could rise in the way that would be problematic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q You also teach at the Wharton School, where you received a Ph.D. in applied economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I'm teaching real estate finance and investment analysis -- one semester a year, twice a week. I've taught there for over a decade, so it's nice to be able to follow your students' careers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Are you seeing more or less interest in commercial real estate from your students?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Interest has actually picked up. The evidence of a recovery in the last year has drawn students in.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE'S SOMETHING peculiarly apt about the fact that the current European crisis began in Greece. For Europe's woes have all the aspects of a classical Greek tragedy, in which a man of noble character is undone by the fatal flaw of hubris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long ago Europeans could, with considerable justification, say that the current economic crisis was actually demonstrating the advantages of their economic and social model. Like the United States, Europe suffered a severe slump in the wake of the global financial meltdown; but the human costs of that slump seemed far less in Europe than in America. In much of Europe, rules governing worker firing helped limit job loss, while strong social-welfare programs ensured that even the jobless retained their health care and received a basic income. Europe's gross domestic product might have fallen as much as ours, but the Europeans weren't suffering anything like the same amount of misery. And the truth is that they still aren't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Europe is in deep crisis -- because its proudest achievement, the single currency adopted by most European nations, is now in danger. More than that, it's looking increasingly like a trap. Ireland, hailed as the Celtic Tiger not so long ago, is now struggling to avoid bankruptcy. Spain, a booming economy until recent years, now has 20 percent unemployment and faces the prospect of years of painful, grinding deflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tragedy of the Euromess is that the creation of the euro was supposed to be the finest moment in a grand and noble undertaking: the generations-long effort to bring peace, democracy and shared prosperity to a once and frequently war-torn continent. But the architects of the euro, caught up in their project's sweep and romance, chose to ignore the mundane difficulties a shared currency would predictably encounter -- to ignore warnings, which were issued right from the beginning, that Europe lacked the institutions needed to make a common currency workable. Instead, they engaged in magical thinking, acting as if the nobility of their mission transcended such concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is a tragedy not only for Europe but also for the world, for which Europe is a crucial role model. The Europeans have shown us that peace and unity can be brought to a region with a history of violence, and in the process they have created perhaps the most decent societies in human history, combining democracy and human rights with a level of individual economic security that America comes nowhere close to matching. These achievements are now in the process of being tarnished, as the European dream turns into a nightmare for all too many people. How did that happen?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ROAD TO THE EURO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all began with coal and steel. On May 9, 1950 -- a date whose anniversary is now celebrated as Europe Day -- Robert Schuman, the French foreign minister, proposed that his nation and West Germany pool their coal and steel production. That may sound prosaic, but Schuman declared that it was much more than just a business deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one thing, the new Coal and Steel Community would make any future war between Germany and France ''not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible.'' And it would be a first step on the road to a ''federation of Europe,'' to be achieved step by step via ''concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.'' That is, economic measures would both serve mundane ends and promote political unity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Coal and Steel Community eventually evolved into a customs union within which all goods were freely traded. Then, as democracy spread within Europe, so did Europe's unifying economic institutions. Greece, Spain and Portugal were brought in after the fall of their dictatorships; Eastern Europe after the fall of Communism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1980s and '90s this ''widening'' was accompanied by ''deepening,'' as Europe set about removing many of the remaining obstacles to full economic integration. (Eurospeak is a distinctive dialect, sometimes hard to understand without subtitles.) Borders were opened; freedom of personal movement was guaranteed; and product, safety and food regulations were harmonized, a process immortalized by the Eurosausage episode of the TV show ''Yes Minister,'' in which the minister in question is told that under new European rules, the traditional British sausage no longer qualifies as a sausage and must be renamed the Emulsified High-Fat Offal Tube. (Just to be clear, this happened only on TV.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The creation of the euro was proclaimed the logical next step in this process. Once again, economic growth would be fostered with actions that also reinforced European unity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advantages of a single European currency were obvious. No more need to change money when you arrived in another country; no more uncertainty on the part of importers about what a contract would actually end up costing or on the part of exporters about what promised payment would actually be worth. Meanwhile, the shared currency would strengthen the sense of European unity. What could go wrong?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer, unfortunately, was that currency unions have costs as well as benefits. And the case for a single European currency was much weaker than the case for a single European market -- a fact that European leaders chose to ignore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE (UNEASY) CASE FOR MONETARY UNION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International monetary economics is, not surprisingly, an area of frequent disputes. As it happens, however, these disputes don't line up across the usual ideological divide. The hard right often favors hard money -- preferably a gold standard -- but left-leaning European politicians have been enthusiastic proponents of the euro. Liberal American economists, myself included, tend to favor freely floating national currencies that leave more scope for activist economic policies -- in particular, cutting interest rates and increasing the money supply to fight recessions. Yet the classic argument for flexible exchange rates was made by none other than Milton Friedman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case for a transnational currency is, as we've already seen, obvious: it makes doing business easier. Before the euro was introduced, it was really anybody's guess how much this ultimately mattered: there were relatively few examples of countries using other nations' currencies. For what it was worth, statistical analysis suggested that adopting a common currency had big effects on trade, which suggested in turn large economic gains. Unfortunately, this optimistic assessment hasn't held up very well since the euro was created: the best estimates now indicate that trade among euro nations is only 10 or 15 percent larger than it would have been otherwise. That's not a trivial number, but neither is it transformative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are obviously benefits from a currency union. It's just that there's a downside, too: by giving up its own currency, a country also gives up economic flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine that you're a country that, like Spain today, recently saw wages and prices driven up by a housing boom, which then went bust. Now you need to get those costs back down. But getting wages and prices to fall is tough: nobody wants to be the first to take a pay cut, especially without some assurance that prices will come down, too. Two years of intense suffering have brought Irish wages down to some extent, although Spain and Greece have barely begun the process. It's a nasty affair, and as we'll see later, cutting wages when you're awash in debt creates new problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you still have your own currency, however, you wouldn't have to go through the protracted pain of cutting wages: you could just devalue your currency -- reduce its value in terms of other currencies -- and you would effect a de facto wage cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Won't workers reject de facto wage cuts via devaluation just as much as explicit cuts in their paychecks? Historical experience says no. In the current crisis, it took Ireland two years of severe unemployment to achieve about a 5 percent reduction in average wages. But in 1993 a devaluation of the Irish punt brought an instant 10 percent reduction in Irish wages measured in German currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why the difference? Back in 1953, Milton Friedman offered an analogy: daylight saving time. It makes a lot of sense for businesses to open later during the winter months, yet it's hard for any individual business to change its hours: if you operate from 10 to 6 when everyone else is operating 9 to 5, you'll be out of sync. By requiring that everyone shift clocks back in the fall and forward in the spring, daylight saving time obviates this coordination problem. Similarly, Friedman argued, adjusting your currency's value solves the coordination problem when wages and prices are out of line, sidestepping the unwillingness of workers to be the first to take pay cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So while there are benefits of a common currency, there are also important potential advantages to keeping your own currency. And the terms of this trade-off depend on underlying conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one side, the benefits of a shared currency depend on how much business would be affected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think of this as the Iceland-Brooklyn issue. Iceland, with only 320,000 people, has its own currency -- and that fact has given it valuable room for maneuver. So why isn't Brooklyn, with roughly eight times Iceland's population, an even better candidate for an independent currency? The answer is that Brooklyn, located as it is in the middle of metro New York rather than in the middle of the Atlantic, has an economy deeply enmeshed with those of neighboring boroughs. And Brooklyn residents would pay a large price if they had to change currencies every time they did business in Manhattan or Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So countries that do a lot of business with one another may have a lot to gain from a currency union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, as Friedman pointed out, forming a currency union means sacrificing flexibility. How serious is this loss? That depends. Let's consider what may at first seem like an odd comparison between two small, troubled economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate, scenery and history aside, the nation of Ireland and the state of Nevada have much in common. Both are small economies of a few million people highly dependent on selling goods and services to their neighbors. (Nevada's neighbors are other U.S. states, Ireland's other European nations, but the economic implications are much the same.) Both were boom economies for most of the past decade. Both had huge housing bubbles, which burst painfully. Both are now suffering roughly 14 percent unemployment. And both are members of larger currency unions: Ireland is part of the euro zone, Nevada part of the dollar zone, otherwise known as the United States of America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Nevada's situation is much less desperate than Ireland's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First of all, the fiscal side of the crisis is less serious in Nevada. It's true that budgets in both Ireland and Nevada have been hit extremely hard by the slump. But much of the spending Nevada residents depend on comes from federal, not state, programs. In particular, retirees who moved to Nevada for the sunshine don't have to worry that the state's reduced tax take will endanger their Social Security checks or their Medicare coverage. In Ireland, by contrast, both pensions and health spending are on the cutting block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, Nevada, unlike Ireland, doesn't have to worry about the cost of bank bailouts, not because the state has avoided large loan losses but because those losses, for the most part, aren't Nevada's problem. Thus Nevada accounts for a disproportionate share of the losses incurred by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-sponsored mortgage companies -- losses that, like Social Security and Medicare payments, will be covered by Washington, not Carson City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there's one more advantage to being a U.S. state: it's likely that Nevada's unemployment problem will be greatly alleviated over the next few years by out-migration, so that even if the lost jobs don't come back, there will be fewer workers chasing the jobs that remain. Ireland will, to some extent, avail itself of the same safety valve, as Irish citizens leave in search of work elsewhere and workers who came to Ireland during the boom years depart. But Americans are extremely mobile; if historical patterns are any guide, emigration will bring Nevada's unemployment rate back in line with the U.S. average within a few years, even if job growth in Nevada continues to lag behind growth in the nation as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, then, even as both Ireland and Nevada have been especially hard-luck cases within their respective currency zones, Nevada's medium-term prospects look much better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does this have to do with the case for or against the euro? Well, when the single European currency was first proposed, an obvious question was whether it would work as well as the dollar does here in America. And the answer, clearly, was no -- for exactly the reasons the Ireland-Nevada comparison illustrates. Europe isn't fiscally integrated: German taxpayers don't automatically pick up part of the tab for Greek pensions or Irish bank bailouts. And while Europeans have the legal right to move freely in search of jobs, in practice imperfect cultural integration -- above all, the lack of a common language -- makes workers less geographically mobile than their American counterparts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now you see why many American (and some British) economists have always been skeptical about the euro project. U.S.-based economists had long emphasized the importance of certain preconditions for currency union -- most famously, Robert Mundell of Columbia stressed the importance of labor mobility, while Peter Kenen, my colleague at Princeton, emphasized the importance of fiscal integration. America, we know, has a currency union that works, and we know why it works: because it coincides with a nation -- a nation with a big central government, a common language and a shared culture. Europe has none of these things, which from the beginning made the prospects of a single currency dubious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These observations aren't new: everything I've just said was well known by 1992, when the Maastricht Treaty set the euro project in motion. So why did the project proceed? Because the idea of the euro had gripped the imagination of European elites. Except in Britain, where Gordon Brown persuaded Tony Blair not to join, political leaders throughout Europe were caught up in the romance of the project, to such an extent that anyone who expressed skepticism was considered outside the mainstream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the '90s, people who were present told me that staff members at the European Commission were initially instructed to prepare reports on the costs and benefits of a single currency -- but that after their superiors got a look at some preliminary work, those instructions were altered: they were told to prepare reports just on the benefits. To be fair, when I've told that story to others who were senior officials at the time, they've disputed that -- but whoever's version is right, the fact that some people were making such a claim captures the spirit of the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro, then, would proceed. And for a while, everything seemed to go well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EUROPHORIA, EUROCRISIS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro officially came into existence on Jan. 1, 1999. At first it was a virtual currency: bank accounts and electronic transfers were denominated in euros, but people still had francs, marks and lira (now considered denominations of the euro) in their wallets. Three years later, the final transition was made, and the euro became Europe's money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transition was smooth: A.T.M.'s and cash registers were converted swiftly and with few glitches. The euro quickly became a major international currency: the euro bond market soon came to rival the dollar bond market; euro bank notes began circulating around the world. And the creation of the euro instilled a new sense of confidence, especially in those European countries that had historically been considered investment risks. Only later did it become apparent that this surge of confidence was bait for a dangerous trap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greece, with its long history of debt defaults and bouts of high inflation, was the most striking example. Until the late 1990s, Greece's fiscal history was reflected in its bond yields: investors would buy bonds issued by the Greek government only if they paid much higher interest than bonds issued by governments perceived as safe bets, like those by Germany. As the euro's debut approached, however, the risk premium on Greek bonds melted away. After all, the thinking went, Greek debt would soon be immune from the dangers of inflation: the European Central Bank would see to that. And it wasn't possible to imagine any member of the newly minted monetary union going bankrupt, was it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, by the middle of the 2000s just about all fear of country-specific fiscal woes had vanished from the European scene. Greek bonds, Irish bonds, Spanish bonds, Portuguese bonds -- they all traded as if they were as safe as German bonds. The aura of confidence extended even to countries that weren't on the euro yet but were expected to join in the near future: by 2005, Latvia, which at that point hoped to adopt the euro by 2008, was able to borrow almost as cheaply as Ireland. (Latvia's switch to the euro has been put off for now, although neighboring Estonia joined on Jan. 1.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As interest rates converged across Europe, the formerly high-interest-rate countries went, predictably, on a borrowing spree. (This borrowing spree was, it's worth noting, largely financed by banks in Germany and other traditionally low-interest-rate countries; that's why the current debt problems of the European periphery are also a big problem for the European banking system as a whole.) In Greece it was largely the government that ran up big debts. But elsewhere, private players were the big borrowers. Ireland, as I've already noted, had a huge real estate boom: home prices rose 180 percent from 1998, just before the euro was introduced, to 2007. Prices in Spain rose almost as much. There were booms in those not-yet-euro nations, too: money flooded into Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a heady time, and not only for the borrowers. In the late 1990s, Germany's economy was depressed as a result of low demand from domestic consumers. But it recovered in the decade that followed, thanks to an export boom driven by its European neighbors' spending sprees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything, in short, seemed to be going swimmingly: the euro was pronounced a great success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the bubble burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You still hear people talking about the global economic crisis of 2008 as if it were something made in America. But Europe deserves equal billing. This was, if you like, a North Atlantic crisis, with not much to choose between the messes of the Old World and the New. We had our subprime borrowers, who either chose to take on or were misled into taking on mortgages too big for their incomes; they had their peripheral economies, which similarly borrowed much more than they could really afford to pay back. In both cases, real estate bubbles temporarily masked the underlying unsustainability of the borrowing: as long as housing prices kept rising, borrowers could always pay back previous loans with more money borrowed against their properties. Sooner or later, however, the music would stop. Both sides of the Atlantic were accidents waiting to happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, the first round of damage came from the collapse of those real estate bubbles, which devastated employment in the peripheral economies. In 2007, construction accounted for 13 percent of total employment in both Spain and Ireland, more than twice as much as in the United States. So when the building booms came to a screeching halt, employment crashed. Overall employment fell 10 percent in Spain and 14 percent in Ireland; the Irish situation would be the equivalent of losing almost 20 million jobs here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was only the beginning. In late 2009, as much of the world was emerging from financial crisis, the European crisis entered a new phase. First Greece, then Ireland, then Spain and Portugal suffered drastic losses in investor confidence and hence a significant rise in borrowing costs. Why?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Greece the story is straightforward: the government behaved irresponsibly, lied about it and got caught. During the years of easy borrowing, Greece's conservative government ran up a lot of debt -- more than it admitted. When the government changed hands in 2009, the accounting fictions came to light; suddenly it was revealed that Greece had both a much bigger deficit and substantially more debt than anyone had realized. Investors, understandably, took flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Greece is actually an unrepresentative case. Just a few years ago Spain, by far the largest of the crisis economies, was a model European citizen, with a balanced budget and public debt only about half as large, as a percentage of G.D.P., as that of Germany. The same was true for Ireland. So what went wrong?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, there was a large direct fiscal hit from the slump. Revenue plunged in both Spain and Ireland, in part because tax receipts depended heavily on real estate transactions. Meanwhile, as unemployment soared, so did the cost of unemployment benefits -- remember, these are European welfare states, which have much more extensive programs to shield their citizens from misfortune than we do. As a result, both Spain and Ireland went from budget surpluses on the eve of the crisis to huge budget deficits by 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there were the costs of financial clean-up. These have been especially crippling in Ireland, where banks ran wild in the boom years (and were allowed to do so thanks to close personal and financial ties with government officials). When the bubble burst, the solvency of Irish banks was immediately suspect. In an attempt to avert a massive run on the financial system, Ireland's government guaranteed all bank debts -- saddling the government itself with those debts, bringing its own solvency into question. Big Spanish banks were well regulated by comparison, but there was and is a great deal of nervousness about the status of smaller savings banks and concern about how much the Spanish government will have to spend to keep these banks from collapsing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this helps explain why lenders have lost faith in peripheral European economies. Still, there are other nations -- in particular, both the United States and Britain -- that have been running deficits that, as a percentage of G.D.P., are comparable to the deficits in Spain and Ireland. Yet they haven't suffered a comparable loss of lender confidence. What is different about the euro countries?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possible answer is ''nothing'': maybe one of these days we'll wake up and find that the markets are shunning America, just as they're shunning Greece. But the real answer is probably more systemic: it's the euro itself that makes Spain and Ireland so vulnerable. For membership in the euro means that these countries have to deflate their way back to competitiveness, with all the pain that implies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble with deflation isn't just the coordination problem Milton Friedman highlighted, in which it's hard to get wages and prices down when everyone wants someone else to move first. Even when countries successfully drive down wages, which is now happening in all the euro-crisis countries, they run into another problem: incomes are falling, but debt is not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the American economist Irving Fisher pointed out almost 80 years ago, the collision between deflating incomes and unchanged debt can greatly worsen economic downturns. Suppose the economy slumps, for whatever reason: spending falls and so do prices and wages. But debts do not, so debtors have to meet the same obligations with a smaller income; to do this, they have to cut spending even more, further depressing the economy. The way to avoid this vicious circle, Fisher said, was monetary expansion that heads off deflation. And in America and Britain, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, respectively, are trying to do just that. But Greece, Spain and Ireland don't have that option -- they don't even have their own monies, and in any case they need deflation to get their costs in line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so there's a crisis. Over the course of the past year or so, first Greece, then Ireland, became caught up in a vicious financial circle: as potential lenders lost confidence, the interest rates that they had to pay on the debt rose, undermining future prospects, leading to a further loss of confidence and even higher interest rates. Stronger European nations averted an immediate implosion only by providing Greece and Ireland with emergency credit lines, letting them bypass private markets for the time being. But how is this all going to work out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOUR EUROPEAN PLOTLINES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists, myself included, look at Europe's woes and have the feeling that we've seen this movie before, a decade ago on another continent -- specifically, in Argentina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike Spain or Greece, Argentina never gave up its own currency, but in 1991 it did the next best thing: it rigidly pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar, establishing a ''currency board'' in which each peso in circulation was backed by a dollar in reserves. This was supposed to prevent any return to Argentina's old habit of covering its deficits by printing money. And for much of the 1990s, Argentina was rewarded with much lower interest rates and large inflows of foreign capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, however, Argentina slid into a persistent recession and lost investor confidence. Argentina's government tried to restore that confidence through rigorous fiscal orthodoxy, slashing spending and raising taxes. To buy time for austerity to have a positive effect, Argentina sought and received large loans from the International Monetary Fund -- in much the same way that Greece and Ireland have sought emergency loans from their neighbors. But the persistent decline of the Argentine economy, combined with deflation, frustrated the government's efforts, even as high unemployment led to growing unrest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By early 2002, after angry demonstrations and a run on the banks, it had all fallen apart. The link between the peso and the dollar collapsed, with the peso plunging; meanwhile, Argentina defaulted on its debts, eventually paying only about 35 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to avoid the suspicion that something similar may be in the cards for one or more of Europe's problem economies. After all, the policies now being undertaken by the crisis countries are, qualitatively at least, very similar to those Argentina tried in its desperate effort to save the peso-dollar link: harsh fiscal austerity in an effort to regain the market's confidence, backed in Greece and Ireland by official loans intended to buy time until private lenders regain confidence. And if an Argentine-style outcome is the end of the line, it will be a terrible blow to the euro project. Is that what's going to happen?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not necessarily. As I see it, there are four ways the European crisis could play out (and it may play out differently in different countries). Call them toughing it out; debt restructuring; full Argentina; and revived Europeanism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toughing it out: Troubled European economies could, conceivably, reassure creditors by showing sufficient willingness to endure pain and thereby avoid either default or devaluation. The role models here are the Baltic nations: Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. These countries are small and poor by European standards; they want very badly to gain the long-term advantages they believe will accrue from joining the euro and becoming part of a greater Europe. And so they have been willing to endure very harsh fiscal austerity while wages gradually come down in the hope of restoring competitiveness -- a process known in Eurospeak as ''internal devaluation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have these policies been successful? It depends on how you define ''success.'' The Baltic nations have, to some extent, succeeded in reassuring markets, which now consider them less risky than Ireland, let alone Greece. Meanwhile, wages have come down, declining 15 percent in Latvia and more than 10 percent in Lithuania and Estonia. All of this has, however, come at immense cost: the Baltics have experienced Depression-level declines in output and employment. It's true that they're now growing again, but all indications are that it will be many years before they make up the lost ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It says something about the current state of Europe that many officials regard the Baltics as a success story. I find myself quoting Tacitus: ''They make a desert and call it peace'' -- or, in this case, adjustment. Still, this is one way the euro zone could survive intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debt restructuring: At the time of writing, Irish 10-year bonds were yielding about 9 percent, while Greek 10-years were yielding 121/2 percent. At the same time, German 10-years -- which, like Irish and Greek bonds, are denominated in euros -- were yielding less than 3 percent. The message from the markets was clear: investors don't expect Greece and Ireland to pay their debts in full. They are, in other words, expecting some kind of debt restructuring, like the restructuring that reduced Argentina's debt by two-thirds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a debt restructuring would by no means end a troubled economy's pain. Take Greece: even if the government were to repudiate all its debt, it would still have to slash spending and raise taxes to balance its budget, and it would still have to suffer the pain of deflation. But a debt restructuring could bring the vicious circle of falling confidence and rising interest costs to an end, potentially making internal devaluation a workable if brutal strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frankly, I find it hard to see how Greece can avoid a debt restructuring, and Ireland isn't much better. The real question is whether such restructurings will spread to Spain and -- the truly frightening prospect -- to Belgium and Italy, which are heavily indebted but have so far managed to avoid a serious crisis of confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Full Argentina: Argentina didn't simply default on its foreign debt; it also abandoned its link to the dollar, allowing the peso's value to fall by more than two-thirds. And this devaluation worked: from 2003 onward, Argentina experienced a rapid export-led economic rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European country that has come closest to doing an Argentina is Iceland, whose bankers had run up foreign debts that were many times its national income. Unlike Ireland, which tried to salvage its banks by guaranteeing their debts, the Icelandic government forced its banks' foreign creditors to take losses, thereby limiting its debt burden. And by letting its banks default, the country took a lot of foreign debt off its national books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Iceland took advantage of the fact that it had not joined the euro and still had its own currency. It soon became more competitive by letting its currency drop sharply against other currencies, including the euro. Iceland's wages and prices quickly fell about 40 percent relative to those of its trading partners, sparking a rise in exports and fall in imports that helped offset the blow from the banking collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of default and devaluation has helped Iceland limit the damage from its banking disaster. In fact, in terms of employment and output, Iceland has done somewhat better than Ireland and much better than the Baltic nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So will one or more troubled European nations go down the same path? To do so, they would have to overcome a big obstacle: the fact that, unlike Iceland, they no longer have their own currencies. As Barry Eichengreen of Berkeley pointed out in an influential 2007 analysis, any euro-zone country that even hinted at leaving the currency would trigger a devastating run on its banks, as depositors rushed to move their funds to safer locales. And Eichengreen concluded that this ''procedural'' obstacle to exit made the euro irreversible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Argentina's peg to the dollar was also supposed to be irreversible, and for much the same reason. What made devaluation possible, in the end, was the fact that there was a run on the banks despite the government's insistence that one peso would always be worth one dollar. This run forced the Argentine government to limit withdrawals, and once these limits were in place, it was possible to change the peso's value without setting off a second run. Nothing like that has happened in Europe -- yet. But it's certainly within the realm of possibility, especially as the pain of austerity and internal devaluation drags on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revived Europeanism: The preceding three scenarios were grim. Is there any hope of an outcome less grim? To the extent that there is, it would have to involve taking further major steps toward that ''European federation'' Robert Schuman wanted 60 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early December, Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg, and Giulio Tremonti, Italy's finance minister, created a storm with a proposal to create ''E-bonds,'' which would be issued by a European debt agency at the behest of individual European countries. Since these bonds would be guaranteed by the European Union as a whole, they would offer a way for troubled economies to avoid vicious circles of falling confidence and rising borrowing costs. On the other hand, they would potentially put governments on the hook for one another's debts -- a point that furious German officials were quick to make. The Germans are adamant that Europe must not become a ''transfer union,'' in which stronger governments and nations routinely provide aid to weaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet as the earlier Ireland-Nevada comparison shows, the United States works as a currency union in large part precisely because it is also a transfer union, in which states that haven't gone bust support those that have. And it's hard to see how the euro can work unless Europe finds a way to accomplish something similar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody is yet proposing that Europe move to anything resembling U.S. fiscal integration; the Juncker-Tremonti plan would be at best a small step in that direction. But Europe doesn't seem ready to take even that modest step.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OUT OF MANY, ONE?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the plan in Europe is to have everyone tough it out -- in effect, for Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain to emulate Latvia and Estonia. That was the clear verdict of the most recent meeting of the European Council, at which Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, essentially got everything she wanted. Governments that can't borrow on the private market will receive loans from the rest of Europe -- but only on stiff terms: people talk about Ireland getting a ''bailout,'' but it has to pay almost 6 percent interest on that emergency loan. There will be no E-bonds; there will be no transfer union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if this eventually works in the sense that internal devaluation has worked in the Baltics -- that is, in the narrow sense that Europe's troubled economies avoid default and devaluation -- it will be an ugly process, leaving much of Europe deeply depressed for years to come. There will be political repercussions too, as the European public sees the continent's institutions as being -- depending on where they sit -- either in the business of bailing out deadbeats or acting as agents of heartless bill collectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor can the rest of the world look on smugly at Europe's woes. Taken as a whole, the European Union, not the United States, is the world's largest economy; the European Union is fully coequal with America in the running of the global trading system; Europe is the world's most important source of foreign aid; and Europe is, whatever some Americans may think, a crucial partner in the fight against terrorism. A troubled Europe is bad for everyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any case, the odds are that the current tough-it-out strategy won't work even in the narrow sense of avoiding default and devaluation -- and the fact that it won't work will become obvious sooner rather than later. At that point, Europe's stronger nations will have to make a choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been 60 years since the Schuman declaration started Europe on the road to greater unity. Until now the journey along that road, however slow, has always been in the right direction. But that will no longer be true if the euro project fails. A failed euro wouldn't send Europe back to the days of minefields and barbed wire -- but it would represent a possibly irreversible blow to hopes of true European federation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So will Europe's strong nations let that happen? Or will they accept the responsibility, and possibly the cost, of being their neighbors' keepers? The whole world is waiting for the answer.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former site of the Honda Proving Center of California, Honda of America's 4,255-acre testing center located about 120 miles north of Los Angeles in the Mojave Desert, is being offered for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No purchase price has been set, but offers of between $10 million and $25 million "are within the range of what we are considering," said Jeff Andrew, a spokesman for <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, a commercial real estate broker, in a telephone interview. He said a "call for offers" would be conducted within 30 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to decommission H.P.C.C. and consolidate the automaker's North American testing activities in Marysville, Ohio, was made about a year ago. The property, most of it a former ranch and alfalfa farm, was purchased by American Honda about 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They've put about $40 million into the facility," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property, which was actually put up for sale in late November, could have a range of uses -- and each would affect what the land's value might be to a perspective buyer, Mr. Andrew noted. For farming or ranching, the value might be closer to $1,000 an acre; areas with access to well water might be worth $2,000 to $4,000 an acre, he added, "and for a solar farm, it might be worth $5,000 to $10,000 an acre."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A noncontiguous, unused portion totaling 457 acres is being offered at $6,000 an acre, the property listing noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be a turn-key operation for an automaker who needed a similar facility, at a great cost saving," Mr. Andrew said. "Hyundai just built a similar facility nearby a while back, and ran into some extra costs over environmental issues, and would have loved to have been able to buy something like this." That said, the brokerage contacted all the major automakers prior to making the property listing public this week, and found no immediate interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There may be an automaker, however, that submits a bid when we have our call for offers," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property is located in a mostly desolate, unincorporated area of Kern County, seven miles north of California City, near Cantil. The main site, according to the listing description, "is comprised of about 3,797 acres improved with a 7.5 mile oval track and 4.5 mile winding road, modeled after common North American public roads, dirt roads, gravel roads, MX/SX race tracks and natural desert terrain." Honda used it for testing automobiles, as well as motorcycles and A.T.V's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main site meets mitigation requirements for habitats where threatened desert tortoises live, Mr. Andrew said, which would allow developers to "fast-track" potential uses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 4,000 acres lie behind a perimeter of high-security fencing, similar to a correctional or military facility. The property is accessed by a private, 1.5-mile road that leads to a security office, and includes more than 30,000 square feet of office and warehouse buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We attempted to research any recent sales by any other automaker of such a testing facility, to be better able to determine a potential price," Mr. Andrew said. "But we couldn't find anything similar to this than anyone else has sold. It's a rare opportunity."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALBANY -- Democratic leaders in the State Assembly are signaling that they are ready to embrace a cap on local property taxes, which could clear the way for its passage this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cap, popular with voters in New York's suburbs, who pay some of the highest property taxes in the nation, is one of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's top priorities and already has support from the Republican-led State Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in what will very likely be one of the defining legislative battles of the year, Assembly leaders are indicating they want something else for their mostly urban constituents: stricter rent regulations for New York City, a measure strongly opposed by Republicans and the real estate interests that helped Mr. Cuomo capture the governor's office in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a day and age when we're talking about giving people the ability to live in their homes and not be priced out of their homes, we should not forget people who have rent protections,'' the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said, adding, ''I just think the philosophy behind the tax cap is the same as the philosophy behind rent regulation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, played down the idea that he was seeking to link the two proposals directly. But Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez of Brooklyn, chairman of the Committee on Housing and an ally of Mr. Silver, made clear they were connected. ''The Republicans want property-tax breaks, and we want that, too,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''But if it's tied to rent regulations that impact a million people, to me that's a very logical option, and I believe the overwhelming number of people in our conference would support that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Mr. Lopez and other senior Assembly Democrats are already paving the way for a kind of bargain, which could include extending an expired tax break, known as 421-A, avidly sought by New York real estate developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed linking of the two issues in the Assembly was first reported on Sunday in The Daily News.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The position taken by Mr. Silver and other Assembly leaders is significant, because the Assembly has in recent years been the place in Albany where proposals to cap property taxes meet a quiet death. His Democratic caucus is dominated by New York City lawmakers whose constituents often do not own homes, and Mr. Silver is tightly allied with public employees' unions worried over the cuts to local government spending that caps would require.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Assembly is also a bastion of support for expanded rent regulations and has passed a package of such legislation several times in recent years -- proposals that have gone nowhere in the Senate, even during the last two years, when it was controlled by Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lopez said his committee was moving fast on an ambitious package of rent legislation, including a bill to abolish vacancy decontrol, a procedure that has allowed owners of rent-regulated apartments to move hundreds of thousands of units out of the rent-stabilization system, according to estimates by tenant advocates. He also said he hoped to pass a temporary extension of the tax break that would expire on the same day in June as the existing rent regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those three issues have to be looked at and somehow thought of in an interrelated way,'' Mr. Lopez said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About one million apartments in the city's five boroughs, roughly half of all rental units, are covered by the existing laws, which sharply limit landlords' ability to raise rents and keep many apartments, particularly in Manhattan, renting at well below market value. Currently, apartments become deregulated when the rent reaches $2,000 and total household income of the tenants is at least $175,000 annually for two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silver said he would like not only to preserve those protections, but also to expand them, by raising the income and rent thresholds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You want to preserve people making $210,000, $225,000 a year, living where they're living,'' Mr. Silver said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One model could be a bill that has passed the Assembly twice in recent years: It would raise the thresholds for so-called high-income decontrol to $2,700 in monthly rent and $240,000 in annual income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cuomo has so far avoided taking a clear stand on the issue. The governor's 273-page ''Urban Agenda'' extensively discussed affordable housing but did not mention rent regulation, effectively New York's largest program of housing subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Josh Vlasto, a Cuomo spokesman, said, ''Our policy on rent control has always promoted and must continue to promote the dual goals of providing stability in the rental housing market while also offering necessary protections to the millions of New Yorkers who live in rent-regulated apartments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the notion of a three-issue deal was quickly criticized by real estate leaders, who argued that property-tax caps and rent regulation should be considered separately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's unacceptable to us; the cap on property taxes doesn't apply to people in New York City,'' said Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York. ''The game of the Legislature is to negotiate and to make connections, and that's traditionally what Albany and Washington have done. We saw nothing happen in Washington because of that policy, and I'm not sure anything gets accomplished in New York.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, declined to comment on the Assembly's proposed rent regulation package, though Republicans have tended to oppose such measures. But he joined Mr. Spinola in arguing that a property tax cap should in no way be linked to rent regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The property-tax cap should stand on its own,'' Mr. Reif said. ''It was a centerpiece of the new governor's agenda. There are many members on both sides of the aisle who ran in support of a property-tax cap. So we should get a result.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much could turn on whether Assembly Democrats are able to split apart the real estate lobby, one of the most powerful and well financed in New York. While the city's large real estate developers, represented by Mr. Spinola, have generally worked closely in Albany with owners of rent-regulated apartments, they may put a higher priority on continuing the 421-A tax break than on paring back rent regulations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Weber writes a column for The Bay Citizen</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial property market is an interesting economic indicator, shedding light on the overall strength of a metro economy -- which segments are doing the best, and what is valued the most by job-creating businesses. The signals are mixed in the Bay Area, but they do suggest that a rebound is under way and that at least for this economic cycle, the perennial concerns that the region might be losing its edge in high-tech are unfounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the South of Market district in San Francisco, the office rental market has tightened dramatically in the last six months, according to local real estate professionals, as fast-growing social media and Internet software companies snap up ''creative'' spaces. For all the talk about how technology enables people to work anywhere, many of these companies clearly find value in being within a few blocks of one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are pockets right now where you can't get any space,'' said Steven Ring, city leader for client solutions at Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Rents in the heart of SoMa are up about 8 percent since early last year, according to Meade Boutwell, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, though they're still well below the peak reached in early 2008, before the global recession hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far, that strength has not bled over into traditional ''Class A'' high-rise space in the financial district, where rents and vacancy rates remain flat. Even brick-and-timber spaces in nearby neighborhoods like Jackson Square have yet to see much of a lift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the new Internet boom retains its momentum, however, service firms like law, accounting and human resources should begin absorbing some of that space. The overall vacancy rate in the city was down just a hair in the fourth quarter of 2010 from earlier in the year, to 15.5 percent, but lease rates were up for the third straight quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market watchers also point to <span class="companylink">Salesforce.com</span>'s recent purchase of 14 acres in the new Mission Bay development, south of SoMa and <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> Park, as a sign of confidence. The software company plans to build a 2 million square foot headquarters campus there. Mr. Boutwell noted that tech companies now account for 30 percent of all tenant demand in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Silicon Valley, some similar dynamics are at play. Over all, the market for office space in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties has been in worse shape than the market in San Francisco. The vacancy rate in downtown San Jose, for example, is over 20 percent, and there is a glut of large vacant research and development facilities across the Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are also hot spots. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> is reported to be acquiring the former <span class="companylink">Sun Microsystems</span> campus in Menlo Park to accommodate its dramatic expansion. Apple has bought another old <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> facility in Cupertino. In Palo Alto, considered the most attractive office location in the Valley, vacancy rates are also dropping, thanks largely to the Internet business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has been a turn this year in the commercial market,'' said Doug Henton, chief executive of Collaborative Economics in San Mateo. He attributes it to the continued growth of giants like <span class="companylink">Google</span> and Apple on the one hand, and a growing class of ''microenterprises'' on the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The East Bay is not benefiting from any tech-driven pockets of strength, according to Edward Del Beccaro, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis</span>, and in fact is suffering from the contraction of some government entities. Nonetheless, he said his firm was hiring in anticipation of a recovery in the second half of this year -- driven largely by a general economic resurgence and accompanying growth in employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judging by the commercial real estate market, the biggest risk to the Bay Area economy is not that high-tech companies will move to cheaper locations; while some manufacturing activities may continue to migrate, in the Internet business, there is a huge incentive to follow the software talent and to be in close proximity to business partners and financiers. Rather, the question for the moment is whether the regional economy is too much of a one-legged stool, and vulnerable to any ebb in the social media and mobile computing tide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the technology business remains strong, the recovery in commercial real estate -- and the economy in general -- should continue apace.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ROB WALKER   </div><div>8243 words</div><div>9 January 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>30</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppose that just after you finish reading this article, you keel over, dead. Perhaps you're ready for such an eventuality, in that you have prepared a will or made some sort of arrangement for the fate of the worldly goods you leave behind: financial assets, personal effects, belongings likely to have sentimental value to others and artifacts of your life like photographs, journals, letters. Even if you haven't made such arrangements, all of this will get sorted one way or another, maybe in line with what you would have wanted, and maybe not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many of us, in these worst of circumstances, would also leave behind things that exist outside of those familiar categories. Suppose you blogged or tweeted about this article, or dashed off a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> status update, or uploaded a few snapshots from your iPhone to Flickr, and then logged off this mortal coil. It's now taken for granted that the things we do online are reflections of who we are or announcements of who we wish to be. So what happens to this version of you that you've built with bits? Who will have access to which parts of it, and for how long?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not many people have given serious thought to these questions. Maybe that's partly because what we do online still feels somehow novel and ephemeral, although it really shouldn't anymore. Or maybe it's because pondering mortality is simply a downer. (Only about a third of Americans even have a will.) By and large, the major companies that enable our Web-articulated selves have vague policies about the fate of our digital afterlives, or no policies at all. Estate law has only begun to consider the topic. Leading thinkers on technology and culture are understandably far more focused on exciting potential futures, not on the most grim of inevitabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless: people die. For most of us, the fate of tweets and status updates and the like may seem trivial (who cares -- I'll be dead!). But increasingly we're not leaving a record of life by culling and stowing away physical journals or shoeboxes of letters and photographs for heirs or the future. Instead, we are, collectively, busy producing fresh masses of life-affirming digital stuff: five billion images and counting on Flickr; hundreds of thousands of <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> videos uploaded every day; oceans of content from 20 million bloggers and 500 million <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> members; two billion tweets a month. Sites and services warehouse our musical and visual creations, personal data, shared opinions and taste declarations in the form of reviews and lists and ratings, even virtual scrapbook pages. Avatars left behind in World of Warcraft or Second Life can have financial or intellectual-property holdings in those alternate realities. We pile up digital possessions and expressions, and we tend to leave them piled up, like virtual hoarders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some point, these hoards will intersect with the banal inevitability of human mortality. One estimate pegs the number of U.S. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> users who die annually at something like 375,000. Academics have begun to explore the subject (how does this change the way we remember and grieve?), social-media consultants have begun to talk about it (what are the legal implications?) and entrepreneurs are trying to build whole new businesses around digital-afterlife management (is there a profit opportunity here?). Evan Carroll and John Romano, interaction-design experts in Raleigh, N.C., who run a site called TheDigitalBeyond.com, have just published a tips-and-planning book, ''Your Digital Afterlife,'' with advice about such matters as appointing a ''digital executor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adele McAlear, a social-media and marketing consultant, became interested in this subject a few years ago, when one of her regular Twitter contacts died. A Web enthusiast who has created ''Lord knows how many profiles'' for herself in the course of road-testing various new services, she is an ''advocate of creating content and putting it online.'' And yet, she continues, it ''hadn't dawned on me, what happens to all of this stuff that you put out there, this digital litter that sort of accumulates.'' That may be particularly true for people like McAlear, who have thoroughly integrated their Web expressions into their identity. (Indeed, she explores her new interest on a blog, DeathandDigitalLegacy.com.) But you don't have to be a social-media consultant to live that way. More and more people do, as a matter of course. Millions of us are ''sharing'' our thoughts and tastes; our opinions and observations about WikiLeaks and ''Glee'' and the Tea Party and some weird dude on the subway this morning; and photographs of newborns and weddings and parties and -- why not? -- that weird dude on the subway. Maybe the momentous and the momentarily amusing add up to a pleasing means of real-time connection, but what do they add up to when we're gone? The legacy of a life you hope your survivors will remember? Or a jumble of ''digital litter'' for them to sort through?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON OCT. 18, 2009, Mac Tonnies updated his blog, sent out some public tweets and private messages via Twitter, went to bed and died of cardiac arrhythmia. While he had experienced some symptoms that indicated potential heart problems, his sudden death came as a shock even to those who knew him well. He was 34.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tonnies lived in Kansas City, Mo. He was single and childless, owned two cats and paid his bills through workaday jobs, behind the counter at <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> or doing phone work for a small marketing agency. He was also a writer (he had just finished a draft of his third book) with an adventurous intellect. His audience was small, but devoted. Tonnies, who started his blog, Posthuman Blues, in 2003, was an extremely active user of online media and forged many friendships with people he never met in the physical world. Many of his interests were distinctly future-oriented, including speculative or fringe topics that sound to most people like science fiction. Often this was the common ground of those online relationships: a freewheeling consideration of the very nature of humanity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rita J. King, an expert on online identity and persona who is an ''innovator in residence'' for I.B.M., was introduced to Tonnies via e-mail in 2004, and they kept in frequent touch. ''He is the one I had all my conversations with, early on, about technology and consciousness,'' she says. Possibly a typical venti latte buyer in Kansas City would have found that puzzling and dismissed some of Tonnies's other interests (U.F.O.'s, life on Mars, the paranormal) as flat-out weird. But online, he wasn't some guy with a lot of strange ideas. He was himself. And he attracted an eclectic group of similarly minded friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last entry on Posthuman Blues was titled ''Tritptych #15,'' a set of three images with no text. The first comment to this post came from an anonymous reader, wondering why Tonnies had not updated the blog or tweeted for two days. Some similar comments followed, and then this: ''Mac Tonnies passed away earlier in the week. Our condolences are with his family and friends in this time of grief.'' The author of that comment was also anonymous. After a rapid back-and-forth about whether this startling news was true and some details of the circumstances, that post's comment section transformed into a remarkable mix of tributes, grieving and commiseration. You can still read all this today, in a thread that runs to more than 250 comments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a very strange feeling,'' Dana Tonnies, Mac's mother, told me, describing how she and her husband became aware of the swirl of activity attaching to her son's online self. ''I had no control over what was being said about him, almost immediately.'' Dana and Bob Tonnies were close to their only son -- in fact they had coffee with him, in a regular Sunday ritual, the morning before he died -- but they had little contact with his digital self. Sometimes he would show them his online writing, but he had to do so by literally putting his laptop in front of them. The Tonnies did not read blogs. In fact they did not own a computer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the months after their son's death, Dana and Bob went about the difficult business of organizing his papers (letters, e-mail printouts, story drafts) and deciding which of his belongings to keep (like his thousand or so books) or to give to his friends (his leather jacket, his three watches). This painful process took awhile, and they were not really focused on his blog or Flickr account and the like. They also inherited their son's computer and have since learned how to navigate it and the Internet. But by then, their son's online circle had already taken action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I spoke to a half dozen people Mac Tonnies met online and in some cases never encountered in the physical world. Each expressed a genuine sense of loss; a few sounded grief-stricken even more than a year later. Mark Plattner, who lives in St. Louis and met Tonnies a dozen years ago through the comments section of another blog, decided that Posthuman Blues needed to survive. He used software called Sitesucker to put a backup of the entire thing -- pictures, videos, links included -- on a hard drive. In all, Plattner has about 10 gigabytes of material, offering a sense of Tonnies's ''personality and who he was,'' Plattner says. ''That's what we want to remember.'' He intends to store this material through his own hosting account, just as soon as he finds time to organize it all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plattner was one of several online friends who got involved in memorializing Tonnies and his work. Dia Sobin, an artist who lives in Connecticut, met Tonnies online around 2006; they communicated often by e-mail and phone, but never met in person. She created art for Tonnies's site and for the cover of what turned out to be his final book. Less than two weeks after he died, she started a blog called Post-Mac Blues. For more than a year, she filled it with posts highlighting passages of his writing, reminiscences, links to interviews he gave to podcasters and bloggers, even his Blip.fm profile (which dutifully records that he listened to a song from ''Everything That Happens Will Happen Today,'' by David Byrne and Brian Eno, at 4:16 p.m. on the last day he lived). Her site is ''a map to Mac Tonnies,'' Sobin says. ''And a memorial.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I only ever knew him over Twitter,'' Sarah Cashmore , a graduate student in Toronto, told me. She shared his enthusiasm for design and technology and learned of his death from Twitter contacts. ''I was actually devastated,'' she says. A few months later, she teamed up with several other members of Tonnies's Twitter circle to start a second Tonnies-focused blog, Mac-Bots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This outpouring of digital grief, memorial-making, documentation and self-expression is unusual, maybe unique, for now, because of the kind of person Tonnies was and the kinds of friends he made online. But maybe, his friend Rita King suggests, his story is also a kind of early signal of one way that digital afterlives might play out. And she doesn't just mean this in an abstract, scholarly way. ''I find solace,'' she told me, ''in going to Mac's Twitter feed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding solace in a Twitter feed may sound odd, but the idea that Tonnies's friends would revisit and preserve such digital artifacts isn't so different from keeping postcards or other physical ephemera of a deceased friend or loved one. In both instances, the value doesn't come from the material itself but rather from those who extract meaning from, and give meaning to, all we leave behind: our survivors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most remarkable set of connections to emerge from Tonnies's digital afterlife isn't among his online friends -- it is between those friends and his parents, the previously computer-shunning Dana and Bob Tonnies. Dana, who told me that her husband now teases her about how much time she spends sending and answering e-mail (a good bit of it coming from her son's online social circle), is presently going through Posthuman Blues, in order, from the beginning. ''I still have a year to go,'' she says. Reading it has been ''amazing,'' she continues -- funny posts, personal posts, poetic posts, angry posts about the state of the world. I ask her if what she is reading seems like a different, or specifically narrow, version of her son. ''Oh, no, it's him,'' she says. ''I can hear him when I read it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mac Tonnies's digital afterlife stands as a kind of best-case scenario for preserving something of an online life, but even his case hasn't worked out perfectly. His ''Pro'' account on the photo-sharing service Flickr allowed him to upload many -- possibly thousands -- of images. But since that account has lapsed, the vast majority can no longer be viewed. Some were likely gathered in Plattner's backup of Tonnies's blog; others may exist somewhere on his laptop, though Dana Tonnies still isn't sure where to look for them. All could be restored if Tonnies's ''Pro'' account were renewed. But there's no way to do that -- or to delete the account, for that matter: no one has the password Tonnies used with Flickr, which is owned by <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>. He used Blogspot for Posthuman Blues; that's a free <span class="companylink">Google</span> product, and there are no fees to keep it updated or any immediate danger of it disappearing. On the other hand, there's no guarantee of how long it will remain. Updating, altering or maintaining it would require Tonnies's password, which he didn't leave behind. Obtaining that password from <span class="companylink">Google</span> would require providing the company with proof of death. As lovely and moving as the tributes and communal mourning that appeared in the comments to his final post are, it's jarring to see the thread gradually infiltrated by spam-bots -- pidgin-English comments followed by long lists for links for ''cheap Ugg boots'' and such. It's like finding a flier for a dry cleaner stuck among flowers on a grave, except that it's much harder to remove.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unlikely the material Tonnies left online would have fared as well had it not been for his savvy and generous circle of Web friends. For most survivors, coping with the physical possessions and conventional assets of the departed can be overwhelming enough, but at least there are parameters and precedents. Even if a houseful of objects is liquidated through an estate sale or simply junked, mechanisms exist to ensure some sort of definitive outcome, even in the absence of a will. And there's no way of ignoring or forgetting it: eventually the stuff will have to be dealt with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bit-based personal effects are different. Survivors may not be aware of the deceased's full digital hoard, or they may not have the passwords to access the caches they do know about. They may be uncertain to the point of inaction about how to approach the problem at all. Any given e-mail account, for instance, can include communication as trivial as an ''I'm running late'' phone call or as thoughtful as a written letter -- all jumbled together, by the hundreds or thousands. Similarly, let's just say not all of us are discriminating curators in uploading pictures to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, for instance, flinging more images from one weekend onto the Web than an earlier generation would have saved from a weeks-long vacation. When you inherit a physical scrapbook or even a diary, some choices have already been made -- either by culling or by constraints of space -- but accessing and then assessing the digital effects of a dead loved one entail a thicket of choices and challenges that many would simply rather avoid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has inspired a variety of entrepreneurs to place bets that, eventually, people will want control over the afterlife of their digital selves. Several promise to manage the details of your digital death -- storing your passwords and your wishes for who gets access to what and integrating your content-related instructions into a kind of adjunct to a traditional will. Legacy Locker claims ''around 10,000'' people have signed up for its digital-estate-management service. Its rivals include DataInherit, a service of DSwiss, ''the Swiss bank for information assets'' (you can even update your digital-legacy data via its iPhone app), and Entrustet, of Madison, Wis. Last May these three firms sponsored Digital Death Day, an event tacked on to an annual online-identity conference near San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The founders of Entrustet are surprisingly young. Jesse Davis , who is 23, was still a student at the University of Wisconsin when he wrote the original business plan in 2008. He came up with the idea after reading what has become one of the best-known stories on the complexities of digital assets and one of the few that has found its way into the courts. Justin Ellsworth, a Marine killed in Iraq in 2004, did not leave behind the password to his <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> e-mail account, and when the company refused to give his parents access to it, they sued. Eventually, under orders from a probate judge, <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> gave them a CD it said contained Ellsworth's e-mail. Ellsworth's story convinced Davis and his business partner, Nathan Lustig, 25, that there was a market for ''digital estate planning'' services. In the case of Entrustet, this means an automated system for storing passwords and instructions for all your digital assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such businesses rest on a simple idea: Web, mobile and social-media use keeps exploding; everyone still dies. Meanwhile, much of the archiving of basic family life is becoming digital. It has become routine to have an online ''presence'' even as an infant, by way of a picture posted on a parent's social-networking profile. Lustig pointed me to a recent corporate study that identified ''chief memory officer'' as a kind of unofficial role taken on by someone (often mom) in many families -- the person who is paying attention to the idea that there may be no physical scrapbook or set of journals to hand down to future generations and that bits-and-bytes memory objects need to be preserved somehow. Trendwatching.com has predicted a ''burgeoning market'' for products and services that protect the digital content that is ''the nucleus of one's personal brand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I spoke to a couple of Entrustet users, who said they particularly wanted to protect photos stored online, along with hosting and domain-registration information for personal and business sites. Entrustet also offers an ''account incinerator,'' to obliterate content its users would prefer not to have linger on after them, and one person I spoke to mentioned having tagged a personal Twitter account for deletion -- ''it's just inside jokes, personal ranting and raving'' -- along with a Gmail account. ''I don't need people judging the personal e-mails that I sent to my friends,'' he explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the degree to which the most popular online platforms involve promoting a quasi-public persona -- the ''you'' who declares fandom of Bob Dylan and Flannery O'Connor, but not the ''you'' who binges on ''Jersey Shore'' reruns and TMZ.com -- this instinct seems logical. If we try to control the way we are perceived in life, why not in death, too? It's not wholly unusual to do this with physical artifacts: letters to be opened only after death, or even to be destroyed. If you don't want your heirs figuring out that you had a secret Tumblog clogged with pictures of Natalie Portman, maybe you should just arrange for it to be ''incinerated.'' If nothing else, those Entrustet users figure they are leaving behind some guidelines about which bits of their online lives matter, and which don't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people do not leave such directives, making the fate of their digital lives uncertain. One of the better-known instances of a disappeared digital legacy involves Leslie Harpold, a Web pioneer who died unexpectedly in 2006, at age 40. Her writing and other online projects connected her with friends and admirers who were helping create the Internet's self-expression tool kit back in the mid-1990s. In early 2010, after her sites Harpold.com and Smug.com quietly disappeared, some of those friends lobbied Harpold's family to let them preserve her work. ''Her work is her legacy,'' one admirer, Rogers Cadenhead, wrote to Harpold's niece, Melissa Krauskopf, an attorney who served as the personal representative of Harpold's estate. ''I have corresponded with several of Leslie's friends about her sites all disappearing from the Web. For what it is worth, all of us believe that she would not have wanted that to happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This offer was declined. Harpold's niece replied that Harpold's legacy isn't in her online work but rather ''is with every person who knew her and loved her.'' I spoke to Krauskopf briefly, and while she was cordial, she had little to add. Had her aunt left directives about her online work, they would of course have been honored, she said. But in their absence, the domains were part of the estate that went to Harpold's mother, and while Krauskopf appreciates the perspective of her aunt's Web friends, it was a family decision that doesn't require public explanation. ''People need to appreciate that she was a real person,'' Krauskopf says, and the family prefers to ''remember her as she was.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might think that stories like that would inspire at least the most cutting-edge true believers in the importance of online expression to stampede digital-afterlife-management companies. But Entrustet and its rivals acknowledge facing a variety of challenges, from an estate-planning community that isn't particularly tech-forward to convincing potential customers that the start-up meant to deal with their digital afterlife will still be a going enterprise by the time they die. I tried out Entrustet myself. It seems to ease the unwieldy process of sorting out what to do with lots of online accounts with different passwords and so on, but I would add another challenge to the list: it's depressing. I made my wife my ''digital executor,'' which meant that she received an e-mail about her responsibilities that she found jarring and a little chilling, even though I'd warned her. The idea of updating this thing every time I change a password or try out a new social Web tool that I may or may not keep using seemed even less enticing than cleaning out the attic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps as a way around this problem, Entrustet is testing the waters on making deals with social-networking services. Its first partner in that approach is <span class="companylink">Broadjam</span>, a service where musicians store and share their work. The idea is that Entrustet will function as a quietly integrated feature built into something you are happily using rather than being the go-to brand for everything you would rather not think about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR NOW, THE DIGITAL identities of people whose Web contacts aren't sophisticated techie types are simply languishing, or quietly fading away, with no hubbub, controlled not by friends or family but by the defaults of the services that enable their creation. And maybe that's as it should be: what difference does it make what happens to the mundane accumulated detritus that makes up so much of what we do online? Once the people who cared about our status updates are gone, who cares if the updates persist?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One answer to that question is future historians. They surely won't be poring over as many physical documents as today's historians do, and surely the granular documentation of life in the 21st century, in digital form, is unprecedented. Fragile digital selves, then, represent a potential loss to the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This point of view has been most convincingly articulated by Dave Winer, the software developer whose Scripting News site is regarded as one of the first examples of what would come to be called blogs. He has been writing about the issue of online content preservation -- he calls it ''future-safing'' -- for several years. His views are a surprise to anybody who assumes that expression preserved in bits is somehow more durable than expression preserved in atoms; in fact he has drawn the opposite conclusion, repeatedly pointing out that digital technologies can be surprisingly unstable or can change rapidly in ways that leave a trail of obsolete material in their wake or both. He has written about his own efforts to preserve the original specs and code for some of his most significant technological creations on a suitably reliable server that future historians and others will be able to access. In thinking about how to do the same for his (and others') online writing, he sounds pessimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point he suggested a big company like Amazon or <span class="companylink">Google</span> might be a suitable repository -- maybe charging a flat fee to host content in perpetuity. But lately he has leaned more toward solutions involving institutions like universities or maybe the government. ''What's needed,'' he wrote in early 2010, ''is an endowment, a foundation with a long-term charter, that can take over the administration of a Web presence as a trust -- before the author dies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, the companies that have created the most popular places and tools for online expression don't exactly encourage users to stop and think about these subjects. Specific policies vary -- details, buried in terms of service agreements, often involve a fair bit of effort, like providing a death certificate -- and newer social-media services often have no particular policy at all. (Twitter established its guidelines only in August 2010.) The most prominent place this issue has come up, not surprisingly, is <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. For some time now, it has offered an option to request that a profile be switched to ''memorial'' mode when an individual dies. A post on the company blog explained that the issue first arose internally back in 2005, when one of its employees -- there were only 40 at the time -- died in a bike accident. (''When someone leaves us, they don't leave our memories or our social network,'' the post said.) Someone must put in a request for a profile to be memorialized, which deactivates certain features and resets various privacy controls, converting its function to a place where friends can leave remembrances. The process doesn't give much direct control to any heir or executor or similar figure, and as some have complained, it can mean wiping out meaningful material and replacing it with ''a thousand 'sorry this happened' '' messages, as one user put it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Winer, however, the issue goes beyond how a person is remembered by those he or she knew. And he's right that Web sites come and go -- often vanishing in months, depending on the whims and intentions and attention span of their creators. One estimate from the late 1990s suggested that almost half the sites created disappear within one year. The Library of Congress has a program that saves slices of the Web and announced last year that it would archive all tweets. But in general its mission is less a comprehensive record than a representative one, built around themes and events, like Sept. 11. Efforts like Internet Archive's WaybackMachine are, while impressive, not intended to be complete. Richard Oram, associate director of the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, recently discussed on NPR the problems of tending archival material stored on old floppy discs. Similarly, saving census data that was once stored on Univac computers was a costly effort, and images recorded by early space missions and stored in now-obsolete formats have simply been lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a huge gap in the Web we're building today,'' Winer has written. ''Eventually it's going to catch up with us when we lose a huge amount of stuff we thought we couldn't lose.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cameron Hunt is one of the few people I encountered who is actively trying to preserve his digital identity. A 38-year-old Tampa resident who works in the military-contracting industry, Hunt attended Digital Death Day last year. Many of those who attended had some professional interest in the subject -- academics, consultants, entrepreneurs. Hunt's interest is more personal. He wants to leave a definitive, and stable, digital legacy behind -- ''a master repository of me,'' as he puts it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His motivations aren't obvious: he is in good health; he's divorced and has no children; and unlike Tonnies he is not engaged in traditional acts of creative expression, like writing books. Raised a Mormon, he never really connected to that church's penchant for genealogy, which always struck him as a bunch of dry lists of names and dates. Then, a couple of years ago, his grandmother died, and he was given a copy of various family stories she had written. ''Reading them as an adult, I was able to read between the lines,'' he says, ''to understand things in a rich way, and see how the stories and the experiences had influenced down through multiple generations.'' Something else happened at the same time: the family realized that a big batch of slides in his grandmother's possession had faded beyond recognition. Hunt was stunned. ''Memories that were precious to me -- not just living them, but after that going back and revisiting them -- and now it's gone,'' he recalls. ''I thought: I really need to do something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hunt uses Twitter and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>; in fact, he has no privacy restrictions on his <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> account, which lists his address and cellphone number. ''I do that as part of my persona,'' he told me when I suggested that it was a bad idea. ''My friends know -- if there's an image that maybe I've cultivated, it's 'Cam's crazy, he won't be afraid to do it.' Therefore opportunities come to me or people confide in me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any case, while he's also a user of Flickr, LinkedIn, Foursquare and various other online services, the core of his digital legacy is a collection of e-mail dating back to 1994. He has come to realize that achieving his goal is going to take serious effort. ''I want to fund a bank account,'' he says, ''so that when I die, a curator can be paid to digitize anything that may not have been digitized, manage the collection, maybe do some research, help people find stuff if they're looking for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You know,'' he adds with a chuckle, ''all these ego-driven things of not being a famous man yet treating my digital afterlife as if I were famous.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admittedly, Hunt's thinking sounds over the top. But part of the reason it seems so audacious is that there is so much to preserve, compared with, say, the physical material his grandmother left behind. A side effect of digital life is that the border between the real-time self-expressive object and the durable memory object has become porous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider Gordon Bell, a famous computer engineer whose innovations date back to the 1960s. More recently he undertook a project under the auspices of Microsoft Research called MyLifeBits, which included not only the totality of his e-mail correspondence but also digital records of Web pages visited, scanned versions of paper notes, recordings of routine conversations and tens of thousands of snapshots taken every 30 seconds by a digital camera that dangles from his neck. Bell suggests that this in fact is ultimately what digital technology is for: ''to capture one's entire life.'' As he once told ComputerWorld magazine, the point is not to share it all in real time but to give the individual a tool to ''leave a personal legacy -- a record of your life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viktor Mayer-Schonberger, in his book ''Delete: The Virtue of Forgetting in the Digital Age,'' notes Bell as an extreme example of a general cultural drift. It is only relatively recently, he argues, that our tools for recording what we see, experience and think have become so easy to use, inexpensive and effective that it is easier to let information accumulate in our ''digital external memories'' than it is to bother deleting it. ''Forgetting has become costly and difficult, while remembering is inexpensive and easy,'' he writes. This is so even though a great deal of our digital expression is simple communication about the present, ''intentionally ephemeral.'' But because it's more trouble to delete old blog posts, digital pictures and tweets than it is to make new ones, ''society's ability to forget has become suspended, replaced by perfect memory.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayer-Schonberger is only glancingly concerned with the notion of legacy; he is mostly making a point about privacy and personal information, not about what happens after life ends. So in the long run, his contention that the digital memory is ''perfect'' is doubtful. And as he notes, even in real time, digital memory can be flawed and misleading: it often merely seems perfect but can be incomplete or even altered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stacey Pitsillides, now finishing a graduate degree in design at Goldsmiths, University of London, has been researching digital afterlife issues for a few years now, drawn specifically to the question of what the piles of identity that we're building up online will ultimately amount to. ''We just see it as this infinity,'' she says, but it isn't. ''There are certain costs, financial costs, physical and social costs, to keeping this amount of data. One of the social costs is that we kind of lose the ability to begin to choose and arrange what we want to say about ourselves, and instead get lost in this wash of information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If every object you've ever owned was a memory object,'' she continues, ''and we gave that to a family member and said, 'You have to remember this person by all of these objects,' then what position would we be in, and how would we ever remember everyone?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is possible that technology will answer this question with new ways for organizing, sifting and coping with masses of preserved personal data. Richard Banks, an interaction designer for Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England, has made some ''technology heirloom'' prototypes that collect, say, tweets or Flickr pictures in new physical devices that would automatically organize them (chronologically or thematically) for heirs or others. And a few nascent businesses have lately floated services that aspire to something closer to Cameron Hunt's ''master repository of me'' or Gordon Bell's vision of total memory forever. Something called Lifenaut.com has a product called a MindFile, ''a database of personal reflections captured in video, image, audio and documents about yourself that can be saved, searched, downloaded and shared with friends.'' This information is meant to be filtered through an ''interactive avatar,'' modeled on you, ''that becomes more intelligent as you add more information.'' The site welcomes you with a sweeping, ominous tone; the company's tag line is ''Eternalize.'' VirtualEternity.com, from a company called Intellitar, also claims to convert the personal data you provide into an avatar -- sort of like one of those chatbots that some online companies use for automated but more humanish customer service. ''We want to give users the gift of immortality,'' an Intellitar founder has said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, to put it mildly, is a hard claim to take seriously. For now, the less pie-in-the-sky issue is whether most people scattering digital objects across the Web have strong feelings about their persistence, or whether, as Mayer-Schonberger suggests, it simply isn't worth the time to dispose of them. To Hunt, his own project is perfectly consistent with any effort to preserve analog mementos of life, just as his family (and many others) have for many years. ''I'm just part of another generation,'' he says. ''I really don't think it's different in instinct or desire from what other people have done -- except that so much of that information is quasi-public already.'' He has a point there: even if we aren't obsessing about the persistence of online expression and memory materials, we sure are cranking it out. What's really surprising is how few Cameron Hunts there are, actively working out which of the digital self-traces they want to preserve, and how to go about it. All he is really trying to do is have some say in how he's remembered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My favorite digital-mortality business, DeathSwitch.com, gives the idea of speaking from beyond the grave a Web-era update. DeathSwitch was founded in 2006 by the neuroscientist and writer David Eagleman to coincide with a short story he wrote for Nature, titled ''A Brief History of Death Switches.'' The story imagines an automated service that allowed its users to send messages after they die. People use it to reveal secret bank accounts to heirs, confess to sins or settle scores from beyond the grave. Over time, uses for this fictional death switch become so elaborate that it is hard to tell that the sender of the message is deceased. That last part hasn't happened yet, but otherwise the service offered by DeathSwitch.com, in real life, is basically the same as the fictional one: some final words from you, to whomever, after you've gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DeathSwitch.com has enough subscribers to cover costs, according to Eagleman. It keeps tabs on users by sending a periodic e-mail to make sure they are still alive. I suggested to Eagleman that I would find this regular reminder of my own mortality pretty unnerving, and he seemed perplexed. ''If you allow the fact that you are going to pass away,'' he replied, ''and there are smart things you can do before you pass away to keep everybody in your family happy and well, then it's as useful as a will, or a do-not-resuscitate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eagleman is an interesting character. He is an assistant professor of neuroscience and psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, and ''Death Switch'' is among the short stories collected in a slim, pleasing book he wrote in his spare time, ''Sum: Forty Tales From the Afterlives.'' As the title suggests, each story imagines some fictional variation on what might come after this life. It's often quite funny and, as Eagleman points out, can be read as fundamentally hopeful in its willingness to wonder openly and imaginatively about life's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His speculative afterlives end up offering provocative takes on what mortality and legacy really mean. One story posits that there are three deaths, the last coming when your name is spoken for the final time. In another, there is a hell in which you see yourself as others saw you; and in yet another, we sit in the afterlife looking back at life for evidence of our influence, as long as it lingers. ''Death Switch,'' the story, suggests that there is no afterlife as we think of it but that ''a version of us'' lives on in the endlessly sophisticated last notes we each send out, creating a strange network of ''transactions with no one to read them.'' The afterlife isn't some other place or state of being. ''Instead an afterlife occurs for that which exists between us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MAC TONNIES'S MANY eclectic intellectual pursuits included at least a passing interest in the notion of cyberimmortality. The idea of the self escaping bodily death by transforming into an age-proof, sickness-proof essence that can be uploaded into a computer or network dates back at least to Vernor Vinge's 1981 novella ''True Names.'' A year after that, William Gibson gave us the word ''cyberspace'' to describe a new place where humans might exist, potentially forever, outside the physical world. By the 1990s, as the Internet became a familiar presence in many people's lives, some began to suggest that this was no mere science-fiction scenario; it was the future. Vinge was among those (along with, notably, Ray Kurzweil) to discuss the transformation of humans by technology, coming in a matter of decades, referred to as ''the singularity.'' The Carnegie Mellon robotics expert Hans Moravec, the artificial-intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky, the computer scientist Rudy Rucker and others articulated visions of a future in which technology might truly free us from ''the bloody mess of organic matter,'' to use a phrase of Minsky's. In her 1999 book, ''The Pearly Gates of Cyberspace,'' Margaret Wertheim contextualized such speculations as attempts to, in effect, ''construct a technological substitute for the Christian space of heaven.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wertheim pointed out that cyberspace had become a new kind of place, where alternate (or at least carefully curated or burnished) identities could be forged, new forms of collectivity and connection explored, all outside the familiar boundaries of the physical world, like the body and geography. It's not such a long journey to follow those assertions to the ''view that man is defined not by the atoms of his body but by an information code,'' as Wertheim wrote. ''This is the belief that our essence lies not in our matter but in a pattern of data.'' She called this idea the ''cybersoul,'' a ''posited immortal self, this thing that can supposedly live on in the digital domain after our bodies die.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that, essentially, is what is implied by Gordon Bell's assertion that his MyLifeBits project is a way to ''leave a personal legacy -- a record of your life.'' Or to put it more prosaically, it's the same thing Trendwatching.com meant by calling your digital traces on social networks the ''nucleus of one's personal brand.'' It's what the uncanny avatars of Lifenaut and Virtual Eternity hope one day to encapsulate. It's at the heart of ''singularity'' theory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wertheim, it should be noted, saw the cybersoul notion as both flawed and troubling, and I would agree. Life's essence reduced to captured data is an uninspiring, and unconvincing, resolution to the centuries-old question of where, in mind and in body, the self resides. At least other imagined versions of immortality (from the Christian heaven to the Hindu wheel of life) suggested a reconciliation, or at least a connection, with the manner in which a physical life is lived; the cybersoul's theoretically eternal and perfect persistence ignores this concept. Most of all, though, fantasizing about living forever -- in heaven or in a preserved pattern of data -- strikes me as just another way of avoiding any honest confrontation with the fact of death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avoiding that confrontation isn't merely a stumbling block for those digital-afterlife start-ups. I was struck by how many of the people I spoke to who professed a keen interest in the issue of preserving a digital legacy had in fact done absolutely nothing about it for themselves. ''Hmm, that's a good question,'' one of the organizers of that Digital Death Day event, a Web-identity expert, replied when I asked her why she had not taken steps to plan for the future of her digital creations. ''I'm probably afraid of resolving the issue,'' another online-expression enthusiast offered (before joking that all he really wanted to do is ''save my work better than my enemies save theirs''). Actually, I completely empathize. I'm not anxious to resolve the issue either, at least not by making any prolonged and thoughtful effort centered on the extended contemplation of my demise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For me, at least, pondering the digital afterlife made me rethink digital life. We're encouraged to record and express everything, all the time. In real time, we can record and distribute the most important moments of our existence, and some of the least. For the generations growing up in the Web era, this mode of being is more or less taken for granted. But the tools we use privilege the moment, not the long term; they also tend to make everything feel roughly equal in importance and offer us little incentive to comb back through our digital scribblings and sort out what might have lasting meaning from what probably doesn't. The results are pretty much the opposite of a scrapbook carefully edited to serve as a memory object but could end up serving that function by default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If ''digital litter'' is all around us, then thinking about how to clean it up in real time -- or producing less of it in the first place -- might be more productive. Rita King, the online-identity expert who was a friend of Mac Tonnies's, is clearly pleased to have access to his online effects and generally optimistic about new forms of remembering that digital technologies might enable. At the same time, though, she expressed some caution about the mindless expression of everything, the default veneration of ''sharing'' over ''curating.'' While she's clearly an online-life enthusiast, she's also careful about what she discloses in that new form of space. ''If people thought about dying more often,'' she observed, ''they'd think about living differently.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I found myself wondering, oddly enough, about what Mac Tonnies's take might be. The last of his friends to whom I spoke was Paul Kimball, a filmmaker who lives in Nova Scotia. He met Tonnies online about a decade ago; they corresponded for six years before meeting in person, when Kimball came to Kansas City to interview Tonnies for a documentary. They ended up becoming close, even collaborating on a play (swapping drafts via e-mail) that was staged at the Boulder International Fringe Festival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among their shared interests, it turns out, was the relationship among technology, consciousness and mortality. Their play, based on a science-fiction story Tonnies had written in college, involves two women who turn out not to be, strictly speaking, creatures of organic matter: one is an artificial-intelligence program, the other a human consciousness uploaded into a form that could survive a centuries-long space journey. The very title of Tonnies's Posthuman Blues blog, Kimball points out, hints at ambivalence about these subjects. But that was the place, he says, where his generally private friend ''revealed himself,'' post by post. The fact that the blog persists, in public, is what makes it distinct from, say, a journal Kimball owns that belonged to his grandfather and that has been read by perhaps 20 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day before we spoke, Kimball continued, he had linked to an old Posthuman Blues post on his <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page, seeking reactions from his own online circle. ''So I'm still having this conversation'' with his friend Tonnies, he told me, ''even though he's been dead for more than a year.'' Eventually, Kimball added, such situations may be routine. ''We're entering a world where we can all leave as much of a legacy as George Bush or Bill Clinton. Maybe that's the ultimate democratization,'' he said. ''It gives all of us a chance at immortality.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After talking to Kimball, I ended up watching a couple of interview clips of Tonnies on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>. In one, he discussed ''transhumanism,'' the techno-scientific quest to transcend the traditional limits of the human animal, death included, whether through merging with machines or fiddling with our genes. Skeptics or opponents of transhumanism are missing the point that it's well underway, he argued: medicine is transhuman, in that it thwarts mortality. While I didn't find this wholly convincing, I will concede that it was interesting to find myself in a position to listen to his arguments at all. It made me wish I could offer Tonnies my counterpoints -- but of course I can't. So I'll give him the last word. ''I like to think of death as a glorified terminal illness,'' Mac Tonnies said, and will continue to say, for as long as this particular collection of bits remains available for someone to watch and listen to. ''If we can escape the boundaries of death, maybe we'll be O.K.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has already changed its name once during its two-month existence and one prominent board member, Richard D. Parsons, the chairman of <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, has already resigned, possibly under pressure from public employee unions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the powerful real estate moguls, bankers and business executives behind the Committee to Save New York are moving ahead and expect to run their first television commercial early next week supporting Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's campaign to oppose tax increases, reduce the size of government and reform Medicaid and public employee pensions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The governor has already called for a one-year salary freeze for state workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the unions representing state employees gird for a possible showdown with Mr. Cuomo, Save New York members spent this week collecting $10 million in pledges for what they describe as an educational campaign that would be a ''counterweight'' to the expected union campaigns opposing drastic cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our goal is to inform the public about what is necessary to rein in government expenses,'' said Bill Cunningham, a managing director at DKC, a public relations firm hired by Save New York and a close friend of the governor's. ''This year, we're seeing a $9 billion budget gap that could grow larger unless the state gets its house in order.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. Cunningham described the committee as broad-based, it is widely viewed by public-sector unions as a pro-business effort to solve the state's fiscal problems by slashing wages and benefits for public employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The departure of Mr. Parsons from the board of Save New York may provide a hint of the coming warfare over the state budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least one public employee union contacted Mr. Parsons's office suggesting that he leave the committee. Union officials say that had he stayed on, they would have contrasted the federal government's bailout of financial institutions like <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> with the Save New York attacks on public pensions. That could have been a public relations nightmare for the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liz Shuler, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said in a statement that she was ''pleased to hear of Mr. Parsons's decision not to participate in Wall Street's attack on working people in New York.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parsons declined a request for an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parsons was to be a co-chairman of the committee, along with H. Carl McCall, a former state comptroller who has worked in the financial industry and Rob Speyer, a co-chief executive of Tishman Speyer Properties, the real estate company that controls Rockefeller Center and other large properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help formulate its message, the committee hired Eric Sedler of ASGK Public Strategies, the firm founded by David Axelrod, until recently a White House adviser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Speyer took the lead in fund-raising, with his firm pledging $1 million. The Durst real estate family provided $200,000 and Stephen M. Ross, chairman of the Related Companies, contributed an amount somewhere in between.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the committee's supporters declined to discuss their donations. Save New York, once known as Restoring the Empire State, is a nonprofit entity that is not required to disclose its donors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have to report it, so why tell you?'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. ''We don't want retaliation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The committee's board of directors is still being formed, but it includes Kenneth Adams, president of the Business Council, an upstate alliance of 200 business and civic groups; Mr. Spinola; Katherine Wylde, president of the Partnership of New York City; Kevin S. Law, president of the Long Island Association; Mary Ann Tighe, a top real estate broker at <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>; and Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, a union alliance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. LaBarbera, the only prominent labor leader to join the group, has been excoriated in private meetings with public-sector union leaders. He has insisted that he will not be part of an anti-union effort, and that he merely wants to express some unions' views about the state's dire fiscal situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction unions that Mr. LaBarbera represents are reeling from high unemployment and are facing what promise to be difficult contract negotiations in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the public-sector union leaders are waiting to see Save New York's ads before deciding whether to attack him publicly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cuomo, who is close to union officials representing health care workers, has taken a more collaborative approach with those unions in his effort to overhaul the state Medicaid program, at least so far. Still, they view Save New York with deep suspicion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a two-year hiatus, the investment market for office buildings has sprung back to life, with some properties commanding prices reminiscent of the boom years. Bidding for well-occupied, high-quality buildings in major cities like New York and Washington has been so fierce that some buyers have been priced out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, for the first time since the collapse of the commercial real estate market, investors are beginning to take risks. Some are buying buildings with vacant space, and others are going after buildings in markets that still have a lot of vacant space and could take much longer to rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the market is only now becoming active, last year about $27.7 billion worth of office properties worth $5 million or more had changed hands through mid-December, more than twice the volume in 2009, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York research firm that tracks sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some deals have been so costly that buyers have had to settle for low initial rates of return of 6 percent or even less. These yields, known as capitalization rates, have fallen faster for office buildings than for any other type of commercial real estate, <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the optimism in the commercial real estate market, the industry still faces obstacles. The job market -- the main driver of office leasing -- has yet to recover. The national vacancy rate was 17.6 percent during the third quarter, up from 16.6 percent in the same quarter in 2009, said Victor Calanog, the director of research for Reis, a New York research company. More than $48 billion worth of office buildings nationwide are in default, bankruptcy or foreclosure, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in New York, <span class="companylink">Google</span> outbid about a dozen other parties to buy 111 Eighth Avenue, which occupies the entire block between 15th and 16th Streets, for $1.8 billion, a yield of 5.25 percent. That transaction has prompted many previously reluctant sellers to reconsider, said the broker who handled the sale, Douglas Harmon, a senior managing director of Eastdil Secured. ''The real estate industry has awoken from a long slumber,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A smaller building, 434 Broadway, at Howard Street, subsequently sold for $41 million, a 5 percent cap rate, in a deal that took only 10 days to go from contract to closing, said Richard Baxter, a vice chairman of the brokerage <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. ''In my 30 years in this business, I've never seen a closing happen so quickly,'' Mr. Baxter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> recently paid $80 million in cash for 1501 M Street, a 177,000-square-foot building that is 97 percent full, said William M. Collins, a senior managing director of Cassidy Turley, a national brokerage. The initial yield on that building was 5.9 percent, but some deals expected to close this month will have even lower capitalization rates, Mr. Collins said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another deal, the World Bank recently paid $216 million for 1225 Connecticut Avenue. The price per square foot -- $900 -- was the highest ever paid for a Washington building, according to the seller, Brookfield Office Properties of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though New York and Washington, where the demand for office space is greatest, have commanded the highest prices, some prominent deals have also occurred in other cities. In July, Hines, a private real estate company based in Houston, sold a new, nearly fully leased 60-story building it developed at 300 North LaSalle Street in Chicago to KBS, a real estate company based in Newport Beach, Calif., for $655 million, an initial yield of 6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And last week, Boston Properties, a publicly traded company that specializes in office buildings in major markets, closed on its $930 million purchase of the 62-story John Hancock Tower, Boston's tallest building. The Hancock tower, which is 95 percent leased, has a capitalization rate of around 4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas T. Linde, the president of Boston Properties, said the low yield was temporary because the previous owner agreed to a long period of free rent for a new tenant, <span class="companylink">Bain Capital</span>, which is leasing 220,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this purchase, Mr. Linde said, Boston Properties now controls nearly 40 percent of the Back Bay office market, giving it a strong leasing advantage there. ''Private equity funds, money managers and hedge funds have gravitated to the Back Bay,'' Mr. Linde said. ''That is where people want to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents are rising in the Back Bay, which has a vacancy rate of 8.8 percent, compared with a 15.9 percent vacancy rate for the Boston area as a whole, said Brendan Carroll, a senior vice president at Richards Barry Joyce, a Boston brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The KBS and Boston Property deals notwithstanding, investors can expect to find better deals if they look outside New York, Washington and San Francisco. Hines, for example, recently bought two other prime buildings in smaller markets -- Fifty South Sixth in Minneapolis for $180 million and Hock Plaza in Durham, N.C., for $98.3 million -- with yields of around 8 percent, said Robert M. White Jr., the president of <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hines's new buildings are nearly fully occupied. But some companies are acquiring buildings with a lot of vacant space, which carries more risk than it did when the market was stronger. Then, vacant space was desirable because many existing tenants were paying rents that were well below the market, said Michael Knott, a managing director of Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach, Calif., company that analyzes real estate investment trusts. Now, however, new tenants may expect to pay a little less than existing tenants, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a deal that <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> said approached a record for Houston, Brookfield Office Properties paid $321.5 million for Heritage Plaza, a 53-story office tower that is 84 percent occupied. Brookfield may have been more motivated than other companies to buy Heritage Plaza because the company already had a major presence in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Houston has been a good job-growth story,'' said Dennis Friedrich, the chief executive of Brookfield's United States commercial operations. Part of what made the deal attractive was low-interest financing, ''which we would not have been able to get a year ago,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another opportunistic deal, Brookfield bought a smaller building in Washington, the eight-story 650 Massachusetts Avenue, near the convention center, for $113 million. The building is more than 25 percent vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Brookfield found the pricing on 1330 Avenue of the Americas, a boutique office building between 53rd and 54th Streets in New York, too rich because the rent-growth projections seemed unrealistic. ''You had to be underwriting rentals by 30 percent in a two- to three-year period,'' Mr. Friedrich said. ''We opted to put our pen down on that one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer was an investment group led by RXR Realty, which paid $400 million for the 534,000-square-foot building. Scott Rechler, the chief executive of RXR, said he was already discussing rents in excess of $100 a square foot with prospective tenants, which consist of smaller financial services companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the potential to find bargains, Mr. Rechler said he did not plan to venture outside the top markets. ''We're not comfortable going to secondary markets,'' he said. ''We'd rather pay for high-quality assets in good locations, where we know there's good demand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Linde of Boston Properties said his company had followed a similar strategy, after disappointing experiences in Baltimore and Richmond, Va. Investors buying in less robust cities were usually seeking an opportunity to make a quick profit as the market improved, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's more of a trading mentality,'' he said. ''We're not looking to get into Minneapolis at the right time and then get out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: The Heritage Plaza, above, a tower in Houston, was sold to Brookfield Office Properties for $321.5 million.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larry Gluck, the apartment building king whose company defaulted on loans in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Washington, recently bought the Windermere Hotel in Manhattan and Tivoli Towers, a subsidized housing complex in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Bruce Eichner, who lost two major New York skyscrapers to foreclosure in the early 1990s and defaulted on a $760 million loan for a Las Vegas casino resort in 2008, is working on a plan to rescue One Madison Park, a troubled 50-story condominium project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Harry Macklowe, whose $7 billion gamble on seven Midtown skyscrapers at the top of the market almost cost him his entire empire, is out looking for new deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry lore has it that New York is one of the toughest, most unforgiving real estate markets in the world. The costs are so high, the unions so ornery, the politicians so demanding and the rivalries so fierce, that one false move invites financial disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the truth is that there have been surprisingly few career fatalities among New York developers, even though they have lost billions of investor dollars on overpriced real estate and have littered the city with unfinished apartment buildings. While a homeowner who lost a house to foreclosure would find it difficult to borrow for years, developers who defaulted on enormous loans have still been able to attract money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons, experts say, are that there is still plenty of money floating around and that the market has a very short memory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can always find an investor who'll put up equity with a guy, unless he's Attila the Hun,'' said Daniel Alpert, managing partner at Westwood Capital, a real estate investment bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some of these developers, however, putting together a deal is not as easy as it used to be. Large banks and pension funds that endured huge losses have become very picky. Scott Lawlor, the founder of Broadway Partners, bought 28 office buildings in 2006 and 2007 and is now stuck with heavy debts on what is left of a portfolio whose value has dropped by at least a third. He is trying to come back with a focus on distressed residential real estate but has been unable to attract institutional money, according to lawyers and real estate executives who know him. He is now trying to line up wealthy investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hedge funds and private equity funds are still offering backing for deals, believing that the real estate market will warm up again this year. There are also new investors looking to get into real estate, including funds based in China, and Norwegian pension funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there have been casualties. Shaya Boymelgreen, the once-ubiquitous developer who built more than 2,400 apartments during the boom, broke with his money partner, was peppered with lawsuits from condominium buyers and was evicted from his offices in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $3 billion real estate portfolio that Kent Swig, a scion of a West Coast real estate family, put together over the past two decades is slowly slipping through his hands, and he warned last year that personal bankruptcy could be in the offing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while a homeowner who is foreclosed upon is often on the brink of financial ruin, many developers who defaulted emerged relatively unscathed themselves. Most of them invested relatively little of their own money in the deals, preferring ''O.P.M.,'' or ''other people's money.'' One of the best-known examples is Tishman Speyer Properties, which lost $56 million on Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, while lenders and other investors lost over $2.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a rare stumble and, in perspective, a minor setback for the company, which controls Rockefeller Center and operates on four continents. It has since raised $2.5 billion to expand its portfolio and recently acquired two buildings in Paris, one in Washington and a 45-story office tower in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Macklowe, an unabashed property gambler, is also considered a real estate genius with a keen eye for development, having turned the G.M. Building across the street from the Plaza Hotel into a gold mine. He sought to double his holdings in 2007 by buying seven office towers for $7 billion. Desperate for cash during the credit crisis 15 months later, Mr. Macklowe was forced to relinquish those buildings and to sell several other properties, including his beloved G.M. Building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now a new set of investors is bringing him back to develop a site he once owned, where the Drake Hotel stood, according to two real estate executives who work with him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, Mr. Gluck and a partner bought the 1,232-unit Riverton Houses complex in Harlem for $131 million. The following year, he refinanced with $250 million in loans, allowing him to renovate the lobbies and elevators and to put tens of millions of dollars in his pocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in less than two years, Mr. Gluck's plan to replace residents of rent-regulated apartments with tenants paying higher rents unraveled. The lender foreclosed as the property's value fell by half. Loan defaults followed in San Francisco, Los Angeles and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most recently, Mr. Gluck and a partner, Rob Rosania, paid $70 million for a residential hotel in Manhattan, the Windermere. But the days of easy money, when Wall Street would lend 90 percent or more of the purchase price, are over, Mr. Gluck said. His lenders required his company to put up 28 percent of the purchase price and to provide an additional $10 million for renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gluck and Mr. Rosania said they were buyers again because they were better capitalized than their competitors and did not squabble with their lenders when the money ran out. ''If you behave like a gentleman and don't leave your partners and investors to fend for themselves, you will be rewarded for your loyalty,'' Mr. Gluck said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his case and others, investors and lenders are forgiving losses incurred after a bubble in which everyone from the smallest homeowner to the largest bank was overleveraged. ''Throughout my 30 years in the business,'' Mr. Alpert said, ''I have seen an enormous amount of forgiveness for market errors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an infuriating pattern for the city's real estate aristocracy, like the Durst family, which has been measured in its borrowing and has never defaulted on a loan. Yet, Douglas Durst said, ''That has not given us any advantage as we go through each financial cycle in which the bankers who made bad loans are let go, but the defaulting borrowers are waiting for the new team of bankers to start the process over again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eichner has been up and down more than once. After lenders took over two of his skyscrapers in 1991, Mr. Eichner dismissed criticism that he was an example of the excesses of the 1980s boom. ''Everyone who was aggressive in the '80s suffered substantial losses,'' he said in 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eichner's lenders suffered the biggest losses, and at one troubled building, 1540 Broadway in Times Square, they paid him tens of millions of dollars in 1992 to relinquish control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, in Las Vegas, Mr. Eichner has said he was a victim of the credit crisis after he was forced to walk away from the Cosmopolitan Resort Casino in 2008. Unable to obtain new financing and plagued by cost overruns and environmental issues, he defaulted on loans from <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Eichner, who did not return calls requesting comment, vowed in 2008 that he would be back and that bankers would lend to him once again. He is now putting together a reorganization plan to salvage the bankrupt tower, One Madison Park. The lender, iStar, opposes Mr. Eichner's involvement, arguing that his approach would unfairly slash the mortgage in half while Mr. Eichner would reap a huge return on his $40 million investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Capital is blind,'' said David W. Levinson, a founder of L &amp; L Holding Company, a real estate firm that controls 11 Manhattan buildings. ''It will go wherever it can for a return. That's it in a nutshell.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS if the process of shopping for an apartment weren't fraught enough, potential buyers and renters will have to deal with another wrinkle this year, when a new real estate broker-disclosure law goes into effect in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law requires a real estate agent to have clients sign a form stating that they understand whom the agent represents and to whom the agent will give ''undivided loyalty,'' as soon as they enter into a relationship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers are interpreting that to mean that the form does not have to be produced for everyone who walks into an open house, but rather as soon as someone starts asking substantive questions about a property, and certainly when someone asks for an appointment to see it a second time. Given that many apartment hunters are reluctant even to put their names on a sign-in sheet at an open house, agents do not want to have to present them with forms any sooner than necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disclosure law is designed to clarify the roles of buyers' and sellers' agents, in order to, as the form itself states, ''help you to make informed choices about your relationship with the real estate broker and its sales associates.'' The form goes on to define the various categories of agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assemblyman Jonathan L. Bing, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation, says the new law increases consumer protection because previous disclosure forms were required only in transactions involving single-family homes and buildings with four or fewer units. Mr. Bing said the state and city Realtors' associations had joined with him in urging passage of the law because it simplifies disclosure of dual agency, in which an agent represents both a buyer and a seller. Buyers can now sign one form providing advance consent to dual agency rather than having to sign a form for each listing that they might see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a consumer protection law,'' said Neil Garfinkel, residential counsel to the Real Estate Board of New York, ''but it also protects brokers, because now they will have a written record of what they're already required to do now verbally.'' If a complaint is filed against an agent for not producing a disclosure form, the penalty is a fine of up to $1,000 and, potentially, a requirement that the agency return the commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law will also apply to sellers and landlords, but for them it will presumably be less jarring, because they will already be in negotiation with an agent for an exclusive contract. The disclosure forms will be fairly straightforward when agents are acting either for the buyer or for the seller. But often circumstances are less clear-cut, because they are acting as dual agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If, for example, a buyer is working with an agent and becomes interested in a listing represented by another agent who works at the same firm, then both agents become dual agents, and neither can provide undivided loyalty to either the buyer or the seller. But they can advocate and maintain confidences for each party. Some agents worry that having to discuss these kinds of possibilities when first meeting clients could frighten them off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property, said she favored the law, and noted that Connecticut and New Jersey had similar ones. ''Things will be more transparent,'' Ms. Ramirez said, ''and that's good for our industry, and the public will be happy to know that nothing has been hidden.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ramirez said that in training seminars some agents worried that the new forms would make it more difficult to make direct deals, in which a seller's agent also represents the buyer. ''Those buyers may say they want their own representation when they fully understand that they won't have the agent's undivided loyalty,'' she said. ''But if you disclose it all, there's no reason you can't treat someone honestly and in good faith, and have the buyer and seller more than pleased with the outcome.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary L. Malin, the president of Citi Habitats, said, ''Agents are always fearful about anything that can change the ebb and flow of business, but it's a change that we all have to adapt to.'' He said his firm had trained more than 600 agents on how to explain the form to potential clients and had also written more than 400 landlords with whom Citi Habitats has done business to introduce the new law and form to them. ''We thought it would be a good thing to advise everybody,'' he said, ''because it's going to be part of the process for all of us from now on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malin said that while some potential clients might balk at signing the form when they had essentially just met an agent, he hoped that in a few months it would simply become a part of doing business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donna Olshan, the president of Olshan Realty, said her agents had been trained by officials from the Real Estate Board of New York, but added, ''Nobody knows how this is going to work.'' Brokers have been told that they must retain every form for three years, including ''affirmation'' forms, in which an agent states that although he or she has presented a disclosure form to a client, the client has refused to sign it. ''We're going to be up to our eyeballs in forms,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disclosure forms may also be quite an eye-opener for renters. In many cases, when an agent has an exclusive rental listing, the agent is the landlord's agent, even though the broker's fee will be paid by the potential renter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some future tenants may get a little freaked out when we have to put in writing that we represent the landlord,'' said Steven Halpern, a sales manager for A. C. Lawrence and Company. ''But it's not a bad thing to clarify who we represent. And if a good agent builds a relationship in a good way, it won't matter.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By VIVIAN MARINO   </div><div>853 words</div><div>2 January 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pizer, 45, is the president of Trinity Real Estate, the real estate arm of the historic Trinity Church, which owns six million square feet of property, much of it office space in the Hudson Square area. Its holdings include 1 Hudson Square, 345 Hudson Street and 100 Avenue of the Americas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pizer was named president in September after serving as leasing director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What was your first order of business as president?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Making sure that the folks remaining here were happy, settled and committed to our goals in the coming years. Second was finding a replacement for myself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transition has been very smooth working with Carl Weisbrod, my predecessor. Carl is a full-time employee at Trinity until Jan. 15; his primary function is to continue work on the rezoning application that Trinity is pursuing for Hudson Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Where do you stand in your efforts to get the area rezoned to include more residential development?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A To go through a large rezoning like this you have to have the community board and city planning sign off. There's a lot of negotiating that needs to go on with city agencies, so we are in that process now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Is it your goal to help turn Hudson Square into a bona fide downtown neighborhood?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Yes. My goal is also to increase the value of our real estate. I want the buildings to become more valuable over time and the rents to rise, so the church can continue its mission in ministry, and the way to do that is to create a 24/7 neighborhood. If that requires a residential component, then that's the avenue we're going to pursue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What kind of rents per square foot are you getting right now in your buildings?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A The deals that we're doing now are mid- to high $30s, on average. We did a couple of deals from the peak years that averaged in the low $50s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q And your occupancy rates?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Right now we're at about 86 percent. At the height of the market, sometime in 2008, we were almost 90 percent occupied portfoliowide; we went down to about 83.5 percent in the midst of the credit crisis. We're currently involved with deals out for signature, and by the end of the second quarter of 2011, we should have about 91.5 percent occupancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Can you talk more about these outstanding leases?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A The financial services firm Two Sigma Investments has just signed a lease for approximately 38,000 square feet. There are three other leases that are about to be signed, for 142,000 square feet in total. They're media types.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q You have a history of renting to media companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A It was primarily printing at one time. When I started here in 1999, we were still about 65 to 70 percent printers. Today we do not have any traditional printers in any of the office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What draws media here is that we've got very high ceilings, nice large windows with bright light and open floor plans. And we became a lower-priced alternative to space in Midtown, also to Flatiron and Park Avenue South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Who's your biggest tenant?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AViacom. They rent out over 400,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Does Trinity ever sell from its portfolio?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A No, not anymore. A long time ago they gave a lot of stuff away -- we gave away property to other churches and we had some sales -- but we have not sold anything in quite some time. The original gift from Queen Anne of England to Trinity Church was 238 acres. What's left is 16 acres. So in terms of serving as an endowment, the idea would be not to diminish it further. The church's philanthropic endeavors are all funded from revenue from the real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Trinity still has parcels that can be developed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We have six sites. Some are vacant, or have a small structure on them that can be removed, or are leased out to a parking lot. Trinity has the ability to add approximately 1.5 million feet of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Are you approached by developers looking to build there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We are approached almost every day by somebody -- a lot of household names. There are people who would like to do hotels; there are people who would like to do strictly office buildings; and there are people who are interested in exploring what type of residential building they could build. Most likely they'll be ground leases with a developer. That's been the model in the past, to have 99-year leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Would you and your family ever consider moving to Hudson Square?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We live in Westchester. Would I move? I probably would, but my wife wouldn't. We have a 7-year-old boy, and they're really entrenched in the neighborhood.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">School District Moves Slowly To Manage Its Real Estate</span>
</div><div class="author">By JENNIFER GOLLAN   </div><div>558 words</div><div>2 January 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>National Edition</div><div>25A</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite being one of the largest financially struggling landowners in the city, the San Francisco Unified School District has largely failed to actively manage its holdings, leaving a number of valuable properties idle for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decades of declining enrollment led the district to acknowledge in 2007 that roughly 20 percent of its holdings had little or no educational use. It also designated 10 vacant or underused properties as surplus and concluded that selling them would net an estimated $134 million, plus millions more in property tax revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But interviews and records show that the district has moved slowly since then to sell or lease the properties. None of them have been sold. Last year, the district cut its real estate department director, who had been in charge of overseeing the sale and leasing of the district's real estate, and shifted his duties to the district's facilities director. A real estate consultant has been hired to help sell and develop these properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say the district's lackadaisical approach is baffling, given that it is facing $113 million in cuts through June 2012. Taxpayers have financed $745 million for two bond measures to pay for improvements to district facilities, and the city has spent millions of tax dollars to help underwrite art and other extracurricular activities for students since 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have significant assets that they should absolutely be making better use of to provide a better education in a time of great need,'' said Abraham Simmons, whose three children attended elementary schools in the city and who recently lost to Mark Farrell in the race to replace Michela Alioto-Pier on the Board of Supervisors. ''The district is sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars of property and officials have been unable to come to agreement for years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The district's surplus properties include what was once the Florence Martin Children's Center, a low-slung building covered with graffiti in the city's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, and a sprawling patch of crumbling concrete and overgrown weeds near Highway 280 in Potrero Hill. Notable exceptions like the former Newcomer High School in Pacific Heights have attracted some tenants -- a Montessori school and a nonprofit organization -- that are generating modest revenue for the district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it may seem like a waste to maintain empty buildings and miss out on potential sales and property tax revenue, some district officials argue that the empty properties could be converted into affordable housing for teachers or new charter schools. At least half of the surplus properties remain unused, according to the district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some of these properties have potential value to us in the future,'' said Jill Wynns, a longtime member of the school board. ''We want to be careful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Wynns said the plan for teacher housing remained stalled, and the staff is busy with other pressing policy issues, like budget cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predicting the district's future enrollment, let alone the number of new charter schools that will open, is impossible, educators say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is like predicting the California economy,'' said Michael Kirst, an emeritus professor of education and business administration at Stanford University. ''Our population growth has slowed, but how do you know it won't resume?''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New year, new you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You've heard it before and probably said it out loud as part of various resolutions you've made over the years. But now, an increasing number of employers want to get into the act: They want to shape you up by paying you or otherwise bribing you to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last decade or so, some companies have made sporadic efforts to adopt workplace wellness programs, some of which had incentives of various sorts attached. Their hope was that the cost of rewarding good behavior would be dwarfed by the cost savings that come from lower medical costs and higher productivity later on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two things have happened recently that will probably bring more incentives to more people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the new health care law explicitly grants permission to employers to offer rewards of up to 30 percent of the total cost of health insurance to employees. Those winnings, often in the form of lower premiums, will go to people who join wellness programs and hit certain health goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, <span class="companylink">UnitedHealth Group</span>, one of the nation's largest insurance companies, now has its own program, called Personal Rewards. Companies like <span class="companylink">Pitney Bowes</span> and <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, a real estate services firm, have signed up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For people already taking reasonably good care of themselves, the rewards can't come fast enough. ''Health insurance is the only one that doesn't have a good-driver discount,'' said Sean Forbes, president of Virgin HealthMiles, an incentive program that companies can use alongside any insurance plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers, however, are less worried about those people than they are about the sedentary, the overweight and the fried-chicken addicted. A big percentage of the costs employers face for people with diabetes and hypertension springs from behavior, not genetics. So their big question is this: Just how much do they have to pay to get people to shape up enough to make the incentive programs worthwhile?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of the perks, which can include discounted travel and merchandise, can spiral well into the four figures annually for employees. So it may be worth lobbying your employer to try one of the programs. But even if you work for yourself or an employer who doesn't want to take this on, there are plenty of ways to create your own incentive program, from seeking sponsorships to placing outright wagers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, however, you need to know what behavior it is you want to incentivize. <span class="companylink">UnitedHealth</span> suggests rewarding people for having a variety of vital signs tested and then giving them more points for hitting goals for things like blood pressure, body mass index and cholesterol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might get more points for undergoing various screenings, including breast, colorectal and prostate. People with chronic conditions could earn even more points for further testing and completing disease management programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies tack on their own extras. <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> added a reward for participating in a back health program, since chronic back conditions are one of the company's biggest sources of insurance claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, companies need to decide what to give away in exchange for the points that employees earn -- and how much of it. <span class="companylink">Pitney Bowes</span> will give $350 each to employees and covered spouses or domestic partners who hit all their marks this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company plans to distribute the money in a lump sum via paychecks at the end of the year. But to my mind, the image of the boss walking around the office handing out stacks of hundred-dollar bills might increase participation even further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outfit that seems to have more experience with these kinds of incentive programs than any on the planet is a South African company called Discovery. When I last wrote about the company, in a 2006 Wall Street Journal article, it was storming the shores of the United States with high-deductible health insurance plans coupled with a wellness incentive program called Vitality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That proved to be an act of hubris, because it's very difficult for a start-up insurer to win market share without access to the physician and hospital discounts that larger competitors can command. The company is now out of the insurance business in the United States but is rebuilding its American operation around its wellness program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now known here as the Vitality Group, the company encourages corporate customers to sign everyone up. It offers to refund as much as 20 percent of its fees if client companies don't see improvement in the health of their workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thing I like most about Vitality, however, is that it allows you to earn various levels of elite status, depending on how many of your goals you reach, how often you go to the gym, whether you take a C.P.R. course and any number of other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is taken straight from the playbook of airline frequent-flier programs, and, as is almost always the case with AAdvantage and Mileage Plus, you need to requalify annually for Vitality's bronze, silver, gold and platinum status. That helps force people to take care of themselves year after year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rewards are pretty good, too, including deeply discounted nights at the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> for platinum members. Vitality's president and chief executive, Arthur Carlos, estimates that a platinum member who works hard at taking advantage of the program can extract more than $5,000 in annual value through the company's network of gym, travel and other discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want your own vacation at the Ritz but, say, work for yourself, there may be a way to get it. You can set a goal for yourself, perhaps losing 20 percent of your body weight or greatly lowering your cholesterol. Then let a skeptical friend bet a few hotel nights that you can't pull it off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You could also use a site like stickk.com, which helps you to penalize yourself financially for not hitting goals. Or you can ask 100 people to sponsor you for $10 each and donate the money to a worthy cause once you hit the mark you've set.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, you might just do what my rapidly disappearing colleague Brian Stelter did: Take to Twitter and use the prospect of public failure to keep you in line. The guy has lost about 90 pounds and now weighs in at a comparatively svelte 180.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one question that employers and individuals want answered, however, is whether any of this works over the long haul. <span class="companylink">UnitedHealth</span> says that its projections for its new program show a positive return on its investment in year two on the money that client companies are paying to enroll their workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vitality Group points to a series of studies its parent company published in 2008 using its own data, all of which I've linked to here in the online version of the column. One study shows that employees of client companies who were enrolled and highly engaged in Vitality and had multiple chronic conditions had, in most cases, lower rates of hospital admission and shorter stays than people with the same conditions who were not participating as aggressively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dana Goldman, a senior economist with the <span class="companylink">RAND Corporation</span> and a professor of medicine and public policy at the University of Southern California, said that the Vitality study can tell you only so much until you compare the employees in its study with others who had no option to join a wellness program and then study both groups over much longer periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate benefits managers get this, but they're willing to try anyway in the face of annual increases in health care costs that far outpace inflation. ''I think it leans more toward a leap of faith,'' said Mary Bradley, director of health care planning for <span class="companylink">Pitney Bowes</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, employers may not be interested in long-term data (or long-term results). In the medium term, many of their employees may leave for other jobs or get laid off. At that point, they become someone else's cost burden. And over the long haul, most people end up in the hands of the federal government and its Medicare program anyhow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why Mr. Goldman wishes the government would find new ways to encourage people to exercise more. ''Medicare should be paying people to take 45-year-olds for walks,'' he said, with only the slightest hint of a chuckle. ''People look at you like you're crazy when you say that, but it would help lots of people get better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, that wouldn't be just a health program. It could solve the jobs problem in the coming year as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: January 5, 2011, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Your Money column on Saturday, about health incentives in the workplace, referred imprecisely to a provision of the new federal health law. The law allows employers to offer rewards to employees of up to 30 percent of the total cost of health insurance (or up to 50 percent in some circumstances); 30 percent is not the minimum amount of rewards allowed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks declined on Thursday despite reports showing a drop in jobless claims, the fastest business expansion in two decades and a gain in pending home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">American Express</span>, DuPont and <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> had the biggest declines in the Dow Jones industrial average as it slipped from two-year highs. <span class="companylink">Anadarko Petroleum</span> rallied 6.9 percent after The Daily Mail newspaper reported that BHP Billiton might make a $90-a-share bid for the oil and natural gas producer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> led gains in home builders after pending sales rose more than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index fell 0.2 percent, also from a two-year high, to 1,257.88. The index has risen 13 percent this year and 6.6 percent this month, the most for December since 1991. The Dow slipped 15.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 11,569.71.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've had a heck of a month for stocks,'' said Walter B. Todd, who helps manage about $900 million at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, S.C. ''It's no surprise to see investors taking a bit of a pause after a big run-up. However, the positive catalysts are still in place and that bodes well for a very decent 2011. Today's jobless claims figures were a real big positive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp; P. 500 advanced 23 percent from its July low through Wednesday as companies reported better-than-estimated earnings and as the Federal Reserve pledged to buy up to $600 billion in Treasuries to stimulate the economy. Its rally to a two-year high pushed its valuation to 15.7 times reported profits, the highest since June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index's 86 percent increase from a 12-year low on March 9, 2009, is the biggest for a comparable time period since 1955, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.&amp; P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said first-time filings for unemployment insurance decreased by 34,000 to 388,000 in the week ended Dec. 25, compared with the median forecast of 415,000 in a Bloomberg News survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago's gauge of business conditions expanded in December at the fastest rate in two decades. The group's business barometer rose to 68.6, exceeding the most optimistic forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the highest level since July 1988. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emerging-market stocks rallied after a report showed that China's manufacturing was growing, signaling more demand for industrial metals. An index of China's manufacturing was 54.4 this month, compared with 55.3 in November, according to the purchasing managers' index released by <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings</span> and Markit Economics. A figure over 50 signals expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper climbed to a record in London and New York, and nickel and zinc gained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Growth in the rest of the world -- not so much Europe -- has been very good for U.S. companies,'' said Albert Meyer, president of Bastiat Capital in Plano, Tex. ''The recent run-up perhaps anticipated some really good news.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">American Express</span> fell 0.8 percent to $42.51. DuPont, the chemical maker, dropped 0.7 percent to $49.69. <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span>, the world's biggest drug maker, declined 0.6 percent to $17.49.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Anadarko Petroleum</span> climbed $4.86 to $75.59. BHP Billiton may make a $90-a-share bid for the company, The Daily Mail reported, without saying where it got the information. Ruban Yogarajah, a London-based spokesman for BHP, declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>, the home builder, rose 0.8 percent to $12.01. An index of pending home resales compiled by the National Association of retailers rose 3.5 percent in November after a record 10 percent increase in October, a sign sales are recovering following a post-tax credit plunge. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for a 0.8 percent increase in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MBIA, the bond insurer, gained the most in more than two months, rallying 15 percent to $11.87 after a court development raised prospects it might resume guaranteeing city and state debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MSCI World Index of 1,660 companies in 24 developed countries like the United States, Britain and Japan rose as high as 1,283.68 on Thursday. The gauge surpassed its closing level of 1,283.14 on Sept. 12, 2008, the last session before Lehman's collapse caused a 46 percent drop through March 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''new economic leadership is reflected by emerging market stocks, which recovered to pre-Lehman levels much faster than have developed stock markets,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at <span class="companylink">Wells Capital Management</span> in Minneapolis. Economic activity in these regions did not slow or contract as deeply and has recovered much faster, he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does the American economy need to get back on its feet? What would help tremendously is fewer roommates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an investment theme, ''household formation'' may sound like jargon. In fact, it is a crucial factor in how the economy will perform in the coming year. The measure basically calculates how many healthy cells there are in the American real estate body. When foreigners move in and buy houses, or the children move out and into apartments, the number of households increases. That, in turn, creates an economic ripple effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small rise in household formation has a beneficial effect on large sectors of the economy, and with it on earnings and the stock market more broadly. Sales of new homes and the materials needed to build or refurbish them increase. Homeowners buy <span class="companylink">General Electric</span> appliances, plasma TVs from <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> and <span class="companylink">Sherwin-Williams</span> paint. Cable operators like <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> sign up new customers, and utilities turn on more lights. Allstate writes additional homeowner policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble is, despite robust demographic numbers, the figure has been growing sluggishly of late. The government estimates that fewer than 400,000 households were formed in each of the last two years ending in March. The average should be around 1.4 million annually, based on precrisis behavior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, it's a big reason for the continued overcapacity in the housing market. Fewer than 800,000 new housing units were built in 2009, and the number should be roughly the same this year. That's the slowest pace by far in four decades. The glut should largely be history given such a glacial pace of construction. Yet rental and homeowner vacancies remain at elevated levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why is household formation down? Difficult economic times have forced people to save money -- and the biggest cost to cut is habitation. People are more likely to shack up and share apartments, while homeowners add renters to help with the mortgage. The footprints in the data are easily spotted. The percentage of 25- to 34-year-olds living at home is at a three-decade high, according to the Census Bureau. Even divorce rates are down. Arguing, it seems, is cheaper than two mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hard times also mean America isn't as attractive a destination for job seekers. The number of legal immigrants fell in 2009. Moreover, illegal immigration appears to have fallen sharply, based on border interdictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these changes should unwind over time. Checking accounts fill, mortgages amortize and 30-somethings realize how hard it is to meet mates when living at home. Eventually, people strike out or decide having a tenant isn't worth the trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, real estate prices have fallen by about a third from their peak in most cities, according to the Case-Shiller index. This makes it easier to afford rent or a down payment. Rental vacancies peaked last fall, and home vacancies in late 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet higher rates of employment and more certainty over jobs would be a greater spur as they are strongly linked to household formation. People are reluctant to move out or buy a home if they aren't working, or think mass firings are imminent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And therein lays the chicken-and-egg problem. Construction is typically one of the first sectors to recover from a recession. The continuing property glut means employment is about two million below its 2006 peak, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since it hasn't revived, America is attracting fewer immigrants and people aren't forming households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, some social and economic changes can be persistent. Japan has yet to recover from its real estate bust. But if demographics are destiny, then America should have a different one. In Japan, the number of people in their 20s -- the prime years for forming a home -- has fallen sharply and continues to shrink. There's a bulge of Americans in this age group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So household formation will rise; it just may take a while. When people do feel a bit more comfortable with their debt levels and jobs, it should provide an immediate stimulus to consumption. And the effect will feed on itself. Immigrants will arrive, and more people will move out. For investors, the sooner the number of roommates decreases, the better. ROBERT CYRAN</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people applying for unemployment benefits fell sharply last week, with applications hitting the lowest level in two and a half years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said applications dropped by 34,000, to 388,000, the lowest number since the week of July 12, 2008. The level of applications has either fallen or remained unchanged in five of the last six weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment applications below 425,000 signal modest job growth. But economists say applications need to fall to 375,000 or below to indicate a significant decline in unemployment. Applications for unemployment benefits peaked during the recession at 651,000 in March 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest report, which covers the week ending Dec. 25, is considered by some economists to be less reliable than most. One reason is that many state offices close for at least one day. Other seasonal factors make the report more volatile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a department analyst said that there were no unusual factors affecting the report and that it considered the impact of the holiday. Economists said what matters most is the downward trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we can continue this improving trend, we'll likely see stronger job growth in 2011,'' Benjamin Reitzes, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications are a real-time snapshot of the job market, reflecting the pace of layoffs. If they continue to move down, hiring is more likely to pick up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week average, a less-volatile measure, dropped by 12,500 to 414,000 in the week that ended on Saturday. That was the lowest level since late July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of the year, applications hovered around 450,000 before dropping below that number in November. The four-week average has fallen by more than 40,000 in the last two months, an indication that hiring could accelerate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers added 39,000 jobs in November, the Labor Department said this month, and the unemployment rose to 9.8 percent. Most economists expect the December jobs report, to be released next week, will show larger job gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total number of people receiving unemployment benefits rose in the week ended Dec. 18 to 4.13 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reitzes said that employers probably added 150,000 net new jobs this month. He also projects the unemployment rate will tick down to 9.7 percent. The monthly total of new jobs could increase next year if claims continue dropping steadily, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That does not include millions of unemployed workers receiving extended benefits under an emergency program set up during the recession. About 4.5 million people are receiving extended benefits for up to 99 weeks. All told, nearly 8.9 million people obtained unemployment benefits in the week ended Dec. 11, the latest data available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the number of people who signed contracts to buy homes rose in November, the fourth increase since contract signings hit a low in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said its index of sales agreements for previously occupied homes increased 3.5 percent last month from a downwardly revised reading in October. Contract signings were up in the West and Northeast but down in the South and Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The signings index is 22.1 percent above June's reading, which was the lowest level since the private group began tracking the data in 2001. Still, signings are 5 percent lower than November 2009 when buyers were scrambling to close purchases to qualify for the first federal tax credit; 2010 is shaping up to be the worst for home sales since 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other housing news, the average rate on 30-year fixed mortgages rose this week to the highest level in seven months, reflecting higher yields on long-term Treasuries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage giant, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, said that the rate increased to 4.86 percent from 4.81 percent in the previous week. It hit a 40-year low of 4.17 percent last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on the 15-year loan rose to 4.20 percent from 4.15 percent -- the highest reading in six months. It fell to 3.57 percent in November, the lowest level on records starting in 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates have been rising since November as investors shift money out of Treasuries and into stocks. Many expect the tax-cut plan will feed economic growth and increase inflation. Yields tend to rise on fears of inflation. Mortgage rates track the yields on the 10-year Treasury note.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The John Hancock Tower, a 62-story glass skyscraper in Boston's Back Bay, was one of the first real estate trophies to run into trouble when the speculative property boom abruptly ended two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the market in free fall, Normandy Real Estate Partners and Five Mile Capital Partners bought the building at a foreclosure auction 18 months ago for $660.6 million, or about half the price in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 4 p.m. on Wednesday, Normandy and Five Mile officially sold the Hancock Tower to Boston Properties for $930 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is an epic conclusion for an iconic landmark,'' said Finn Wentworth, a founding partner at Normandy, a real estate firm based in Morristown, N.J. ''It's due to a combination of real estate savvy and capital savvy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's deal reflects the current optimism coursing through the industry. Commercial buildings have recovered some of their value, and investors are looking to buy solid properties with good cash flow. Commercial mortgage securities also look healthier - although many experts warn that billions of dollars of loans are coming due in the next couple of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turnaround of the Hancock Tower began with a risky plan in 2008 to buy pieces of the mezzanine debt, a junior debt that is less likely to be repaid. The goal of Normandy and Five Mile was to take control through foreclosure if the owner defaulted on the loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time no one knew if it would work, or even how much the building was worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the strategy provides a template for other commercial real estate deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, the owner, Broadway Partners, defaulted on $472.1 million in secondary loans, but a senior mortgage remained current. Normandy and Five Mile bought more than $200 million in mezzanine loans from <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span> and Greenwich Capital for about 30 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the foreclosure auction on March 31, 2009, Normandy and Five Mile were the sole bidders, offering $20 million and taking on the senior mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a pretty bold move, a calculated risk,'' said Kevin O'Shea, the partner at <span class="companylink">Allen &amp; Overy</span> who represented Normandy. ''They were rewarded when property values stabilized and core properties like the Hancock regained their value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone who has pursued the strategy has been so lucky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William A. Ackman of <span class="companylink">Pershing Square Capital Management</span> and Michael L. Ashner of <span class="companylink">Winthrop Realty Trust</span> failed to gain control of the sprawling Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village this year. The two partners bought a $300 million swath of secondary loans on the Manhattan complexes for $45 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But their plan was foiled when the courts ruled that Mr. Ackman had to pay off the $3 billion senior mortgage before he could foreclose. Today, the 11,200-apartment properties are controlled by CW Capital, which represents the senior lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have learned from prior experience that sometimes the better part of valor in an investment situation is to move on,'' Mr. Ackman said of the deal in his third-quarter investment letter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hancock Tower, a Boston landmark since it was built in 1975, has been a barometer for the real estate boom and bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the months before the merger of John Hancock and <span class="companylink">Manulife Financial</span> of Canada, the American insurer sold the Hancock Tower and three related properties in 2003 for $926.8 million to Alan M. Leventhal, the founder of Beacon Capital Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a transaction typical of that period, Mr. Leventhal put up $304 million, or roughly one-third of the purchase price, and took on a $623 million mortgage on the four properties. Beacon valued just the Hancock Tower and a nearby garage at about $639 million, according to real estate executives familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years later, the commercial real estate market was roaring, fed by billions of dollars from foreign investors, pension funds and insurers and cheap debt from Wall Street banks and hedge funds. Mortgages, in turn, were packaged with other loans into a securities and sold to investors - freeing even more money to make deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the money flowing, developers, private equity firms and hedge funds were able to buy properties with increasingly less cash. Many borrowed up to 80 percent of the purchase price, adding sizable second mortgages or mezzanine debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the market neared its peak, Scott Lawlor, founder of Broadway Partners, a highflying money manager, paid $3.4 billion for the Hancock Tower and nine other properties in December 2006. The deal valued Hancock Tower and the garage at $1.35 billion, more than double the price in 2003, according to people familiar with the deal. But it also loaded the property with debt, with a mortgage and secondary loans that covered about 82 percent of the purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a significant group of marquee properties in highly desirable markets that we are confident will deliver strong risk-adjusted returns to our investors,'' Mr. Lawlor said at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed in September 2008, property values had plunged by a third in Boston and elsewhere, according to analysts. Corporate tenants, like the Hill Holiday ad agency at the Hancock Tower, balked at constantly rising rents and moved out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normandy and Five Mile took over in the spring of 2009. Along the way, they refurbished the lobby and created an underground parking garage for top executives, spending more than $40 million on improvements. They were also able to offer lower rents than previous owners. And they scored a major coup in May when <span class="companylink">Bain Capital</span> signed a lease for seven floors, a tenant lured away from a building owned by Boston Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Besides navigating the debt stack,'' said Mr. Wentworth, ''we created value the old fashioned way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, the two firms put the Hancock Tower on the auction block. Boston Properties was the winner, agreeing to put up $289.5 million and assume the $640.5 million mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal closed on Wednesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the year that the economy started to recover and then slid back into a slump -- only to offer reason for renewed hope in the final weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When 2010 began, hiring and consumer spending were finally picking up. But then something changed in the spring -- a combination of the debt troubles in Europe, the fading of stimulus spending and the usual caution by businesses and consumers after a financial crisis. By the summer, the unemployment rate was rising again, and Americans' attitudes about the future were again souring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making matters worse, many of the economy's long-term problems also became more severe this year. Health care costs continued to rise faster than inflation, and the number of uninsured continued to grow. The most recent climate data suggested 2010 would be the hottest or second-hottest year ever recorded; the 10 hottest have all occurred in the last 13 years, creating serious risks for the planet and its economy. The federal budget deficit ballooned further (though it should grow during an economic slump).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons for optimism about 2011 come from both Washington and the private sector. The Federal Reserve and Congress have finally taken more action to lift economic growth, and the latest data -- on consumer spending and jobless claims, among other things -- has been good. The housing market remains weak, but sales and prices are no longer plunging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the longer-term issues, the recent work by President Obama's bipartisan deficit commission suggested that Democrats and Republicans might eventually find some common ground on the issue. And the health care overhaul passed in March -- assuming it survives legal challenges -- is likely to cut the number of uninsured sharply and to reduce cost growth modestly. The one issue that offers little reason for optimism is climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the big questions for 2011 are: How severe will state and local budget crises turn out to be? Will Europe's debt troubles spread to Spain, Portugal or elsewhere? Will Congress and the White House manage to focus on the long-run causes of the deficit -- or instead cut federal spending immediately and jeopardize the recovery? Will consumers continue to increase their spending and give businesses the confidence to hire?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To look back at 2010 and to look ahead, we have put together a series of charts. If there is an overall message, it's that the economy still needs a whole lot of work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DRAWING (DRAWING BY MINH UONG/THE NEW YORK TIMES); CHARTS: Job Growth That Faded . . . Job growth was starting to outpace population growth in the spring of 2010 but then; . . . Means a Long Road Back to Full Employment: 9.4 million jobs would need to be added immediately to reduce the jobless rate to below 6 percent, considered by some economists to be full employment. But the shortfall will grow because roughly 125,000 new jobs a month are needed to keep up with population growth. (Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics; <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics; Census Bureau) (B1); Jobs, Pay and Inflation: Long-term unemployment remained high in 2010. A larger share of workers had been unemployed for at least six months than at any point since the government began keeping records in 1948.; Profits and Stocks: Corporate profits continued a rebound that began in 2009. After big gains in 2009, stocks kept rising in early 2010, fell for much of the spring and summer, and have been mostly rising since. As a result, the market may no longer be regarded as cheap. Relative to earnings over the last 10 years, a measure preferred by the economist Robert Shiller, stocks are slightly more expensive than they have been on average over the last 50 years.; Housing: Home sales rose as people took advantage of a federal tax credit and then fell after the credit expired. The housing crash appears to be over, but no recovery is in sight.; Health Care: Both the cost of health care and the share of people without health insurance continue to rise. Average premiums for families have doubled in the last decade, while more than a quarter of the working-age population was uninsured some time during 2010.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward L. Glaeser is an economics professor at Harvard and the author of the forthcoming book "Triumph of the City."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Census released population figures that will reshape the House of Representatives, moving political power south and west. The four states that added the most people were&nbsp; California, Florida,&nbsp; Georgia and Texas, and the two states with the highest growth rates were Arizona and Nevada. Why do these states attract so many people?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise of the Sunbelt has two common explanations: one climatic and the other commercial. The climatic, obvious explanation is that it's the weather, stupid. The commercial explanation, which has a proselytizing undertone, is that places like Texas and Nevada attract companies and people with their lower business taxes and fewer regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first view emphasizes the outdoors; the second right-to-work laws. If all that we knew was that Sunbelt populations were increasing, it would be impossible to distinguish among these and other theories, but we have evidence on wages, productivity and the price of housing that can help us make sense of the Census.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If economic productivity - created by low regulations or anything else - was causing the growth of Texas and Arizona and Georgia, then these places should have high per capita productivity and wages. Yet per capita state product in Arizona in 2009 was $35,300, 16 percent less than the national average. Per capita state products were $36,700 and $42,500 in Georgia and Texas, respectively.These figures are far below per capita state products in slow-growing places like Connecticut ($58,500), Massachusetts ($50,600) and New York ($50,200). According to the Census Bureau's 2009 American Community Survey, median family incomes were $56,200, $60,800 and $56,600 in Georgia, Nevada and Texas, but $83,000, $81,000 and $66,900 in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low incomes and productivity in the growing states of the Sunbelt strongly suggest that their expansion is not driven by outsized economic success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps, sunshine really is behind Sunbelt growth. A superb climate is surely part of the appeal of Silicon Valley and Los Angeles, but what about fast-growing Houston, which has 99 days a year with the temperature above 90 degrees?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economists' creed that free lunches are rare does appear to apply to cities as well as stocks. If a place is pleasant, you end up paying for it, especially in the form of higher housing prices. That logic explains why the median sales price for a home in the San Jose area was $630,000 in the third quarter of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing prices in Texas and Georgia are neither high nor rising. The median sales price for a home in greater Houston area is $159,000 and in Atlanta $113,000. The comparable figures for New York and Boston are $470,000 and $367,000, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing in the growth regions is inexpensive, both in absolute terms and relative to those areas' incomes. People, perhaps unsurprisingly, don't seem to be putting great value on humid Houston weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those low housing prices actually provide a vital clue about why Arizona, Georgia and Texas are growing. These states have built hundreds of thousands of homes despite having low housing prices. Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York have high prices but far less new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sunbelt pattern of low prices and abundant construction can mean only one thing: an abundant and elastic supply of housing. Demand for new housing, due to either sunshine or economic success, isn't driving Sunbelt growth - low prices belie that explanation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather, in the growing regions, even modest demand creates far more new construction, and population growth, because supply responds so enthusiastically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is housing supply so generous in Georgia and Texas? It isn't land. Harris County, Tex., which surrounds Houston, has a higher population density than Westchester County, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rich body of research shows that regulation, which is intense in the Northeast and California but lax in the Sunbelt, explains why housing is supplied so readily down South. The future shape of America is being driven not by quality of life or economic success but by the obscure rules regulating local land use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sense, the anti-regulation crowd is right that the laissez-faire attitude of the South and West explain its recent growth. But the usual argument focuses on the wrong regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing regulations, more than those that bind standard businesses, explain the Sunbelt's population growth. If New York and Massachusetts want to stop losing congressional seats, then they must revisit the rules that make it so difficult to build. High prices show that the demand would be there if the supply is unleashed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever-rising Maintenance Fees</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RISING maintenance costs were high on the complaint list for apartment owners in 2010, and that's not likely to change in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, as co-op boards were gathering across the city (''It's Co-op Meeting Time. No, Your Fees Will Not Go Down,'' May 23), property managers predicted maintenance increases of 5 to 7 percent in 2010, mostly because of taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But maintenance fees went up an average 11 percent in 2010, and property managers anticipate they could rise by as much as 15 percent in the coming year. Property taxes were again named as the main culprit for the heftier maintenance bills this year and next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average carrying costs for Manhattan co-ops and condos rose to $1,855 a month in 2010, from $1,726 in 2009, according to data compiled by Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and a market analyst for Prudential Douglas Elliman. Five years ago, in 2006, the average was $1,491, nearly 25 percent lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property managers, who recently sent out notices about maintenance increases that will take effect in January, said increases would range from as low as 3 percent to 15 percent, depending on whether a building had deferred any costs in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax bills are on the rise because of a tax rate increase that kicks in on Jan. 1, and because tax assessments are continuing to go up despite the relatively flat real estate market. Assessments have not gone down even as values have dipped because they are phased in over a five-year period, and tax bills are still being calculated using property valuations that were made when the market was booming in 2007 and early 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even though we were in a down financial situation, real estate taxes saw huge jumps last year and the year before,'' said Stuart Smolar, the executive director of the Andrews Building Corporation, which manages more than 300 properties. He said the average tax increase this year, though, should be a little lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuart M. Saft, the chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that ''a couple years from now, when tax appeal hearings are held,'' and the highest valuations are replaced by lower ones, ''there will finally be some reduction in real estate taxes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combined tax rate and tax assessment increases are a ''double whammy'' for homeowners, said Dan Wurtzel, the president of Cooper Square Realty, which manages 400 buildings in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using an Upper East Side building with about 160 units as an example, Mr. Wurtzel said that the building's assessed valuation last year was $8.8 million, giving it a $1.165 million tax bill. This year, the assessment rose to $9.5 million and taxes went up to $1.268 million; and the bill starting next July is estimated at $1.4 million because of an anticipated $10.1 million assessed valuation. ''Everything is going up every year,'' Mr. Wurtzel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to property taxes, buildings must contend with rising utility costs and salary increases of about 3 percent negotiated last spring for the 30,000 unionized doormen, porters, janitors and building superintendents. VIVIAN S. TOY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Temporary Walls Prove Resistant</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW to find an affordable way to live in an unaffordable city? It is a question just about every New Yorker has asked. And one answer has long been to find a small space, split it into two even smaller spaces with a partition of some kind, and share the cost. But this year, temporary walls came under increased scrutiny. (''The Fall of the Temp Walls,'' July 18.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a prosecutor decided to level manslaughter charges at the owners of a building that had a fatal fire in 2005 and, more recently, the city sought to eliminate illegally installed walls in the Stuyvesant Town complex on the East Side, many management companies began to worry about their legal liability if walls had been erected without the proper permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York City Department of Buildings staged a sting operation last spring, visiting apartments listed for rent on Craigslist, and found that of 62 apartments -- renting for $750 to $1,200 a month -- 54 were illegal conversions. Thirty-three were in such bad shape that the city ordered they be immediately vacated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The department has its work cut out. Temporary walls are everywhere, from an apartment in Murray Hill shared by recent college graduates, to a windowless basement in Queens bursting with workers eking out a living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has focused on the most dangerous living arrangements. But for those whose situations are not so obviously problematic, the varying policies of landlords have caused as much confusion as prevention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert D. LiMandri, the commissioner of the buildings department, said that the agency was working to provide clarity for renters on what is legal, including creating a Web page to help consumers recognize an illegal conversion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you are looking for an apartment in Brooklyn and the market rate is $3,000 and it is renting for $1,800, you have to ask yourself why it is so cheap,'' Mr. LiMandri said. ''People have woken up and they realize they are trading their safety for a better deal on an apartment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donny Zenger, the project manager of All Week Walls, a company that specializes in installing pressurized walls in New York City apartments, said the conflicting messages coming from building managers had caused chaos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When some companies first moved to ban the walls, Mr. Zenger said that brokers and others in the industry ''were very frantic and it was very hurtful'' to companies like his.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as time passed, it became clear that many landlords were not willing to sacrifice the higher rents they could charge by allowing the walls, and enforcement was scattershot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The management companies are not resolving anything or taking steps to solve the problem,'' Mr. Zenger said. ''They are just masking it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he had worked with clients who had been told they could split the apartment, only to be informed after signing the lease that the cost and responsibility of securing the necessary permits would fall on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a lengthy and expensive process,'' he said. ''It takes at least two months and costs a lot of money. No one is going to do this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zenger, who says that his company is licensed by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs and has never run afoul of fire-code laws, said one solution would be for landlords to inspect their own premises to determine where walls can be erected legally before renting out apartments, saving everyone trouble. MARC SANTORA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tumbled Marble</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE Aug. 8 article and video about ''The Mystery of the Lost City'' reported that a long-abandoned litter of old marble columns in the woods near the Delbarton School in Morristown, N.J., had been discovered to be from the demolished half of Colonnade Row in TriBeCa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a rush of correspondence, one writer stated that the ''missing columns'' from Colonnade Row were actually in Ringwood Manor, N.J., and demanded a correction. The Ringwood columns are indeed handsome, but they are not from the 1833 Colonnade Row, the surviving stretch of which is on Lafayette Street just south of Astor Place. Another correspondent, David Lee Smith, pleaded, ''Please let us know that they are not going into a landfill.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smith, our patience will be required, because several dozen tons of marble do not have obvious reuse value. Some of the pieces, especially the capitals, have severely deteriorated, even in the view of someone like me, whose taste runs toward ruination. And if the idea is to reconstruct some of the Colonnade Row facades, too many pieces are missing. Luther Kountze, who rescued the marble early in the 20th century, did not save all the elements of the facade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired four elements: base, bottom drum, top drum and capital. Morrison Heckscher, the Lawrence A. Fleischman chairman of the museum's American Wing, says these will be re-erected there sometime in the coming year, in the manner of the fourth-century B.C. marble column from the Temple of Artemis at Sardis in the Greek and Roman Galleries: the upper part resting on the lower, separated by a blank section.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brother Paul Diveny, the headmaster of Delbarton, says that the school has been contacted by a few individuals and architectural salvage firms, but won't take action until it decides what it wants to keep for itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the Lost City, having been uprooted from the woods, is still taking up space in a parking lot at Delbarton. In the meantime Mr. Heckscher is quite pleased with the new acquisition. He says there is ''a bravura in the design and execution which is remarkable, and since the mud and moss were washed off, they're a very light sandy color contrasting with the glistening quartz.''

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treacherous Balconies</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN a city constantly reaching toward the sky, most New Yorkers worry from time to time that something may at any moment fall to earth and spell their doom. From the small rusted air-conditioners that dangle precariously from windowsills, to the mammoth cranes perched on high, there is plenty to worry about. But tragedy is rare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, attention was focused on yet another danger looming overhead -- and jutting underfoot: the balcony. (''Balconies Declared Unsafe at 16 New York Buildings,'' May 17.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, 24-year-old Connor Donohue fell to his death from a 24th-floor balcony on East 39th Street when the railing failed, and inspectors from the Department of Buildings fanned out across the city to crack down on faulty terraces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was the largest facade safety initiative we have done in the history of the department,'' said Robert D. LiMandri, its commissioner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, inspectors visited more than 800 buildings; at 17, they found conditions so bad that they immediately ordered the balconies closed. Problems were encountered in every borough except Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it has been at least six months since most of the violations were found, only 3 of the 17 cited buildings have corrected the problems and reopened the balconies. Those three, all in Manhattan, are at 201 West 70th Street; 1675 York Avenue; and 1365 York Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focus on balconies revealed how lax some property owners have become.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city requires that all buildings over six stories have their balconies and facades inspected -- at owner expense -- every five years. ''There is a standard program,'' Mr. LiMandri said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Mr. Donohue's death, it quickly became clear that many landlords were not in compliance. Inspectors found that nearly 1,000 buildings had failed to file the required safety reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sweep began at these recalcitrant buildings and then moved to other locations. Sometimes the problems were so severe that inspectors, peering upward with binoculars, could see the danger from the sidewalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most common violations involved the concrete balconies that jut out of the side of the buildings, beyond the exterior walls. Typically found in structures built in the 1980s, the balconies were cited for defective concrete and faulty and unsecured metal railings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the sweep is over and Mr. LiMandri said that he did not want to telegraph any future actions. However, he said that he viewed it as the department's job to keep the focus on the issue, particularly now, in the bitter cold of winter, when balconies are not exactly the go-to spot for most apartment dwellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things happen every day in New York and people don't pay attention,'' Mr. LiMandri said. ''We need to get out there and push the message. I guarantee you, in the spring, this is going to be a topic of interest again.'' MARC SANTORA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mortgage Morass</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MORTGAGE rates may still be enticingly low, but buyers trying to secure mortgages continue to be frustrated; the process is no easier now than it was after the market crashed and credit seized up in late 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate and mortgage brokers say that if anything, it may even be harder now, thanks to tougher guidelines from the mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As much as we'd like to think that credit markets are easing up,'' said Melissa Cohn, the president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, ''the banks are still being very tough. Every week it seems like there's a new surprise -- a new wrinkle or requirement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest change has many banks running second credit checks on buyers right before contracts close. So if a buyer put a roomful of new furniture on a credit card after going into contract on a new home, the bank could decide to decline the mortgage application at the last minute, Ms. Cohn said. The bank's intent is to ferret out any hidden debt, but she said buyers seeking to avoid disappointment would be wise not to ''spend a cent from the moment the bank gets the first credit report until you close.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other requirements that surfaced in 2010 continue to flummox buyers. For instance, some banks require buildings in flood zones to have insurance covering replacement costs, even if the building is a 30-story apartment tower. Banks have also refused to make loans in town houses that have window bars, even if the building is a designated landmark, when the bars are on the front windows and in rooms that have doors providing safe egress. On top of that, banks have required buildings to have reserve funds equal to 10 percent of their operating budgets, something that most recently built condos have not had time to accumulate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers said that to satisfy these requests, some buildings have increased their flood insurance, removed window bars or raised common charges to increase the reserve fund. But in other cases, buyers have had to start over and find a lender that did not have those requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frances Katzen, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, had two recent deals threatened by the flood insurance requirement. One, on West 18th Street, met the standard easily because it could increase its flood coverage for a nominal fee. But the other, on Water Street, had to assess each apartment owner $1,000 to secure adequate insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Katzen said the flood insurance guideline might make sense for single-family houses in a coastal city, but she questioned why it should apply to a Manhattan apartment tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problem is the banks are trying to enforce these vanilla guidelines in New York City, when New York City is not vanilla,'' she said. VIVIAN S. TOY</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MORE than a year after Westchester County settled a federal lawsuit with a promise to create 750 below-market-rate homes in wealthy, predominantly white communities, at least one element of a housing plan is moving ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, James E. Johnson, the federal monitor overseeing Westchester's compliance with the settlement, accepted a model ordinance -- a template for obtaining land use approvals -- that local governments can follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that did not keep the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which brokered the settlement, from announcing last week that another element of the plan, the county's ''analysis of impediments'' to fair housing, was ''incomplete and unacceptable.'' In a letter to the county, H.U.D. said Westchester had failed to set forth strategies to overcome exclusionary land-use approval processes and zoning ordinances. The agency gave the county until April 1 to revise its analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The settlement signed in August 2009 calls for Westchester to spend $51.6 million over seven years to create the homes. Norma Drummond, the county's deputy commissioner for planning, said the model ordinance accepted last month could help municipalities streamline some aspects of preparation for new housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Drummond, detailing the housing proposals moving ahead or under consideration by the Board of Legislators, identified them as: 51 condos in Larchmont; 22 units in Rye; and a rental development in Cortlandt in which 83 units will be affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, three rental units are to be built for the physically handicapped in Mohegan Lake in Yorktown, and a three-family house is to be rehabilitated in Pelham.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The settlement, signed by Andrew J. Spano when he was county executive, stipulates that of the 750 houses or apartments, 630 must be provided in towns and villages where black residents constitute 3 percent or less of the population and Hispanic residents make up less than 7 percent. The 120 others face a different set of criteria for cost and ethnic concentration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among communities affected by settlement are Bedford, Bronxville, Cortlandt, Dobbs Ferry, Eastchester, Hastings-on-Hudson, Harrison, Irvington, Larchmont, Lewisboro, Mamaroneck, New Castle, North Castle, Pelham and Pelham Manor, Pleasantville, Rye, Rye Brook, Scarsdale and Yorktown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three rental apartments for people with physical disabilities in Mohegan Lake will be developed by Freedom Gardens for the Handicapped, a nonprofit group in Yorktown. Estimated rent for the one-bedroom units is $1,280 a month. The Board of Legislators has approved the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Larchmont condo project, to be built by Wilder Balter Partners in Elmsford, entails construction of two buildings near the train station. The 10 one-bedrooms and 41 two-bedrooms will be available to families earning 80 percent of the median income (the planning department puts the median for a two-person household at $83,750). The project is up for approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total cost is projected at about $20 million, said William G. Balter, one of the partners. Financing will come from federal, state and county sources. The smallest one-bedroom unit (about 800 square feet) will sell for $155,000; the largest two-bedroom with a den (about 1,600 square feet) will go for $241,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These units are not for poor people,'' Mr. Balter said. ''They're for working-class people who work in the community, in the banks and schools, for example.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He saw the need for moderately priced units as great enough in Westchester that the units would be ''sold out before they are even finished.'' But that has not been the case at an affordable-housing project in Ossining with 12 units, built by the county two years ago. Sales there have been slow, Ms. Drummond said, adding, ''In the current economy, people have been reluctant to lock into homeownership.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Rye, Lazz Development of Rye Brook has plans for Cottage Landings, which will consist of 18 town houses. Eleven one-bedroom units are to be sold for about $150,000 each, and 7 one-bedrooms with dens for about $165,000. Lazz will also build four one-bedroom units to be sold at market rate. The cost of the project, on a one-acre site that already contains two two-family houses, is about $5.8 million; financing is to be federal, state and county. The project has been approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Lazz project, the three-family house in Pelham, envisions a two-bedroom apartment for the homeowner and two rental units, a one-bedroom providing income of $1,150 a month and a two-bedroom providing $1,375 a month. The proposed price to the buyer is $325,000. The project has been submitted for approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board has also approved financing for the Cortlandt rental project, called Roundtop at Montrose, of which 83 units will be affordable. (An additional eight units were approved by the town as affordable-housing units before the settlement, and therefore will not count.) Eligibility will be restricted to families with incomes no higher than 60 percent of the area median. Rents will range, depending on income, from $870 a month, for a one-bedroom, to $1,270 for a two-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Anti-Discrimination Center, the New York City fair housing group that brought the suit against the county 16 months ago, said others among the 31 municipalities earmarked for new housing remained resistant, and more legal action against Westchester may be necessary to force compliance. Alfred A. Gatta, Scarsdale's village manager, pinpointed the cost of land there as one impediment, expressing doubt about developer interest in building affordable projects when the property itself is so pricey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have been looking over the model ordinance, and we have the zoning in place to allow for multifamily development,'' Mr. Gatta said. ''But I think at $1.6 million an acre for vacant land here, some developers just won't bother.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Scarsdale supports the idea in concept,'' he added. ''I just wish the county would have negotiated a settlement agreement that would have taken that into account.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Craig Gurian, the executive director of the Anti-Discrimination Center, did not buy Mr. Gatta's argument. He said the county had the legal tools to force municipalities to develop zoning that would allow for even higher density, and that in turn would make it feasible for developers to build affordable units in places with high land costs..</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Little Momentum in Two Critical Gauges of Economic Recovery</span>
</div><div class="author">By CHRISTINE HAUSER   </div><div>1002 words</div><div>24 December 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As analysts try to gauge the pace of the economic recovery, they inevitably take the pulse of the housing and job markets. And despite some upbeat trends like stronger retail sales and new reports that showed increases in personal spending, sales of new homes remained at historically low levels last month and the job market showed little sign of momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Thursday that sales of single-family homes rose slightly in November but were still well below last year's levels. Economists said that the market continued to struggle despite low mortgage rates as buyers and builders struggled with an uncertain job market and tighter access to credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said in a separate report that for the week that ended on Saturday, the number of people applying for first-time unemployment benefits fell by 3,000, to 420,000, the second-lowest number for the year. The figure was largely in line with expectations but would likely have little effect on the overall unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Recent results are horrendous, and most indicators of the housing market point to continued weak conditions in spite of very low mortgage rates,'' said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family houses rose 5.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 290,000 in November, compared with the previous month, the Commerce Department said. But the rate was more than 20 percent below the 368,000 sales rate in November a year ago, the agency said. October sales were revised lower, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 275,000, down from 283,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The November 2010 rate was also below analysts' expectations for 300,000. And new-home sales for 2010 show the seasonally adjusted annual revised rate for August was 274,000, the lowest level since such data was compiled starting in 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the actual number of homes sold in November was 21,000, the lowest monthly sales figure on record. Part of the problem is that access to credit is tighter as smaller banks struggle with nonperforming debt, said Patrick Newport, the United States economist for IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Builders are saying they cannot finance viable projects,'' Mr. Newport said. ''From a builder's point of view, this is the worst month that they have ever had. They have never sold so few homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have been watching the Labor Department's weekly claims for first-time unemployment benefits, hoping that a firmer job market will embolden home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Greenhaus, the chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak &amp; Company, said that the downward trend in jobless claims was more pronounced than an upward trend in the housing data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thing with the homes sales data in general is that they are all at such incredibly depressed levels,'' said Mr. Greenhaus. ''There is no sustained move upward. We are basically bouncing along for much of 2010 at an all-time low.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said continuing unemployment benefits claims fell to 4.06 million in the week that ended Dec. 11, down from 4.17 million the previous week. The four-week average declined to 4.16 million, from 4.19 million, the department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If that continues it is unquestionably a positive,'' Mr. Greenhaus said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales could be helped early next year with a projected decline in interest rates as long as there is stronger employment and income growth, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, a report by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, one of the nation's biggest buyers of home mortgages, said 30-year rates dropped to an average 4.81 percent this week from 4.83 percent a week ago, and 5.05 percent in the same week in 2009. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 4.15 percent, down from 4.17 percent the previous week and 4.45 percent a year ago, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at IHS Global Insight are projecting a further decline of 4.65 percent to 4.7 percent in 30-year fixed mortgage rates in early 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Holding everything else constant, it would marginally help sales,'' said Brian A. Bethune, the chief United States financial economist at IHS Global Insight. ''But there really isn't any evidence of any underlying sustained strengthening in the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Newport said that the market had been distorted by the government's $8,000 tax credit, which drew some home buyers into the market. It has since expired. ''We have not made much headway in sales and starts for the past 23 months,'' Mr. Newport said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home sales data also showed that sales prices for new homes were falling, a reflection of lower labor costs and the smaller homes and lower prices that builders were using to attract buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for a new home rose to $213,000, but was down 2.7 percent from November last year. At November's sales rate, the supply of new homes fell slightly to 8.2 months, with 197,000 new homes for sale, the lowest since March 1968.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market was still a concern of many consumers, according to economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, those worries were partly reflected in a report by Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan, which showed their Consumer Sentiment Index rose 2.9 points to reach 74.5, the highest level since June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong housing market could affect spending on items like durable goods. A government report said durable goods orders dropped 1.3 percent in November, a larger decline than expected.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Norcor Management Corporation bought the Sunnyside Jewish Center in Queens in 2006, it demolished the synagogue in expectation of building residential housing on the site. But like so many projects, the plans were dashed in the wake of the real estate crash, and the parcel has sat vacant for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the School Construction Authority is in talks to buy the site and build a 379-student primary school on the land, located at 45-46 42nd Street. The new building, which would open in 2014, is in New York City's most congested school district and would help ease overcrowding at nearby public schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The downturn in the real estate market has afforded us some new opportunities,'' said Lorraine Grillo, president of the School Construction Authority, which is financed jointly by the city and state, ''including residential developments that stalled and are now available for us to acquire.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal in Queens is in the midst of a public review process, and must be submitted to the mayor and City Council for final approvals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The education sector, and especially the School Construction Authority, has become big business in the world of New York City real estate. As residential condominiums, office towers and other private sector projects have faltered, the authority has swooped in to take advantage of lower construction costs, amenable landlords and available land to pursue an aggressive expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the S.C.A. has built a record 26 new facilities, creating room for 17,500 students. The authority, which oversees the building and maintenance of the city's nearly 1,700 public schools, is in the second year of an $11.7 billion five-year capital plan, to run from the 2010 to 2014 fiscal years. The city Department of Education is lobbying for an additional $4.4 billion that would put it on track to have added nearly 124,000 seats from 2003 to 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The S.C.A. is the biggest game in town,'' said Richard T. Anderson, the president of the New York Building Congress, a construction trade group. ''In terms of actual construction, the S.C.A.'s five-year capital plan is the largest agency program in the city,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The education sector accounted for more than half of all construction starts in New York City from May 2008 to the end of last April, a pattern that is expected to continue, according to the building congress. In addition to traditional public schools, the number of charter schools in the city has surged to 125 in 2010, from just four in 1999, according to the New York City Charter School Center, and several private schools have been in the market for new buildings. At the postsecondary level, the City University of New York, New York University and Columbia University are all planning major expansions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Working with the School Construction Authority is a great opportunity, especially in this market,'' said David Lowenfeld, the executive vice president of the World-Wide Group, a developer. World-Wide broke ground in May on a $700 million mixed-use building at 250 East 57th Street at Second Avenue that will house two public schools, expected to open in 2012. The building, designed by <span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</span>, also includes 38,000 square feet of retail space that has been leased to a <span class="companylink">Whole Foods Market</span>. A second phase of the project will include an additional 74,000 square feet of retail space and a 660-foot residential tower with rental units and condominiums. World-Wide is leasing the air rights from the city to build the residential part of the project, and these lease payments are paying for the construction of the schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so much money available for publicly financed schools, large construction firms that once eschewed public sector jobs in favor of private projects are now angling for the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are no new commercial office buildings being built, but there are a lot of schools in the works, so we have gone back and focused more on the S.C.A.,'' said Charles Murphy, a senior vice president at the Turner Construction Company and the general manager of the New York office. Turner is building four schools for the School Construction Authority, which now makes up about 12 percent of the company's work in New York, up from zero during the real estate market peak, Mr. Murphy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of a sudden, marquee construction firms that would only do projects that were $15 million and above are bidding for S.C.A. jobs,'' said Louis J. Coletti, the president and chief executive of the Building Trades Employers' Association, the largest contractor association in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this competition has been good news for the construction authority. ''We have seen the cost of building stabilize, and we are attracting a number of high-end general contractors who are now bidding on our projects,'' Ms. Grillo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, she said, ''landlords seem more willing to work with us, as they recognize the value of a city tenant.'' In downtown Manhattan, for example, ''we have been able to find a lot of rental properties in office buildings; if the market was hotter, these landlords might not have been so willing to rent us the space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to new schools financed by the construction authority, charter schools, private schools and universities are also rapidly expanding. This year, 27 new charter schools -- which are are mostly privately managed and publicly financed -- opened, and only one closed, the charter school center said. Civic Builders, one of the largest developers of charter schools, is building or about to build 440,000 square feet of space, said David M. Umansky, the firm's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private schools have also been eyeing real estate. The all-girl Brearley School recently acquired three buildings on the Upper East Side, and a school founded by the Blue Man Group theater troupe recently purchased the Seamen's Church Institute building at the South Street Seaport, where it will provide a new nursery and elementary school. Columbia University is expected to begin work next month on an adjunct campus north of 125th Street near the Hudson River, while New York University is starting a 25-year expansion plan. And there are a number of construction projects at the City University of New York, including a new Science Building at Lehman College and an expansion of John Jay College.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs, however, that the School Construction Authority's spending spree may soon be over. The city and state are both facing looming deficits, and have financed the authority's five-year capital plan only through the 2012 fiscal year. The city is estimating a deficit of $2.4 billion next year, and last week Mark Page, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, asked that various city departments, including the Department of Education, submit proposals to shave 20 percent a year from their capital spending. The state is facing a projected deficit next year of more than $9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, said Mr. Murphy of Turner, by the time the School Construction Authority begins winding down its work, either because of a lack of city and state money or because the need for new schools has eased, the rest of the real estate market should be rebounding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By the middle of the decade, around 2013 or 2014, I see an increase in private sector construction,'' he said. ''So in the short term, the S.C.A. funds are there to help us through this year and next, and then other parts of the industry will begin picking up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: December 24, 2010, Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about the growth of the school construction sector in New York described the financing of charter schools incorrectly. Most of them are privately managed and publicly financed. Their finances do not come mainly from private sources.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE tape measure does not lie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when it comes to measuring the square footage of New York City apartments, the tale told by the tape can be exaggerated, massaged, misrepresented and manipulated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are willful -- and legal -- tactics to make a space appear bigger on paper, like including common spaces and elevator shafts in the calculation of an apartment's size. There are also honest mistakes that derive from historical inaccuracies, differences in how condominiums and co-ops are measured, advances in measuring technology, changes in measuring standards, and unusual layouts. Then there are outright misrepresentations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can all add up to confusion or worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers may be saddled with an apartment that the bank finds to be less valuable than assumed, because it is smaller than was thought. Deals can be delayed or even denied if lenders calculate a square footage different from the one listed, which can lower the appraised value. And developers who grossly overestimate square footage in an offering plan may find themselves being sued or losing deposits if the attorney general finds they acted in bad faith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is an implied precision,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the Miller Samuel appraisal firm. He prepares the quarterly market reports for Prudential Douglas Elliman, which track prices per square foot, among other indicators. In reality, he said, the measurements are anything but precise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller, who said he had calculated square footage for more than 7,000 New York City apartments, estimates that measurements vary by about 10 percent industrywide. Dimensions are generally taken with a laser device, the latest in a long line of tools used to gauge the size of apartments. But the laser is only as good as the person wielding it. And sometimes the stated square footage is a willful exaggeration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I remember seeing a condo unit and being told it was 600 square feet,'' Mr. Miller said. ''And I immediately thought, if this is 600 feet, I am blind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers are often accused of overestimating. Bank assessors, on the other hand, are widely thought to underestimate. Even when estimates are in agreement, owners are likely to resist any change that will decrease the size, and therefore the value, of an apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Official oversight of square footage measurements is limited, real estate lawyers said. Condo developments are required to say how they calculate square footage in their offering plans, which are filed with the state Office of the Attorney General. But there is no similar requirement for co-ops. And even in newer condos, as the property changes hands over the years, small inflations may morph into architectural tall tales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers are often careful to say they take no responsibility for listed square footage, and owners may honestly not know how large their home is. So, often, there is no obviously responsible party when discrepancies are found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Wagner, a real estate lawyer, says he encourages anyone thinking about buying an apartment in a new building to hire a lawyer to read the offering plan closely in order to determine whether the square footage measurements include common space like elevator shafts and hallways -- adding them in is legal in some cases, but that is not common knowledge. He said buyers of resales would be wise to have an architect or engineer measure the place before any contract is signed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wagner said it was more than two decades ago, when many buildings were being converted to co-ops, that he began noticing that the square footage numbers were being cooked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some of the sponsors converting the buildings started measuring not from the interior wall, but from the exterior wall,'' he said. ''Of course, that does not work very well unless you plan on living inside the brick wall itself.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a certain amount of variation is tolerated, Mr. Wagner said, ''the standard for fraud is a misrepresentation of material fact.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There comes a point where it is not O.K.,'' he said. ''But I can't tell you whether it is 2 percent or 20 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One buyer, Glenn Evans, a senior vice president of <span class="companylink">Estee Lauder</span>, is sure that he was defrauded. When Mr. Evans and his partner, Calvin Poon, moved back to New York from Shanghai in 2009, they told their broker that they wanted a place with more than 2,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I must have showed them 40 or 50 apartments,'' said Robert Beacham, a broker at the Real Estate Group of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was not until they walked into a two-bedroom co-op apartment at 1200 Broadway, a former hotel built just after the Civil War, that they knew they had found their new home. The building's mansard roof, ornate windows and high ceilings were all part of the draw. But so was the price per square foot. Mr. Evans said that the apartment was listed at 2,170 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We did all our calculations based on the price per square foot,'' he said. At the time, the broker representing the seller -- who could not be reached recently for comment -- insisted that the price per square foot was well below market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller was asking for $1.749 million, and Mr. Evans countered with an offer of $1.65 million, which was accepted. But as part of the loan-approval process, the bank did two appraisals, both of which flabbergasted Mr. Evans. The bank found that the apartment was either 1,634 square feet or 1,741 square feet. Admittedly, the place has an odd layout that makes it difficult to measure. But nobody was coming up with anything near 2,170 square feet. Mr. Evans hired an architect to check again. The third measurement came in at nearly 1,800 square feet, convincing him that he had been deceived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Evans tried to negotiate a lower price based on the bank's assessment, the seller refused. Mr. Evans said he was told he would lose his 10 percent deposit if he backed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sued the seller and the brokerage firm, Prudential Douglas Elliman. Mr. Evans claimed that the selling broker knew the apartment was not 2,170 square feet -- a size given in past transactions -- but continued to use the inflated figure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We just felt we were misled,'' he said. ''There was a deliberate, coordinated action by these people to rip us off.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case against the seller was dismissed when a judge determined that the seller had had nothing to do with the marketing of the apartment. Prudential Douglas Elliman contested the suit, which Mr. Evans recently dropped because it would have been too costly to continue, he said. A spokeswoman for Prudential Douglas Elliman said it never comments on litigation involving the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Evans and Mr. Poon went through with the deal. Although they say they love the apartment, they are still bitter about the experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They were fighting this like a class-action suit,'' Mr. Evans said of the brokerage. ''It would open a whole Pandora's box of liability.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because brokers are generally careful to list square footage as an ''estimate'' or ''approximation,'' there is often little recourse for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that and other reasons it is unwise to place too much emphasis on square feet as a basis for comparison, said Douglas Heddings, the president of the Heddings Property Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''First and foremost,'' Mr. Heddings said, ''I think all the weight that is put on price per square foot, especially in Manhattan, is ludicrous.'' He is particularly skeptical of comparing apartments in different buildings based on their listed square footage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Very rarely can you compare two units unless they are units that are in the same building and were measured using the same standards,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frances Katzen, an executive vice president of Elliman, said a number of her clients had bought apartments that turned out to be smaller than they had been told. She counsels her clients to focus not on square footage, but on what similar properties in the same building have sold for in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is currently showing a duplex apartment at 468 West 23rd Street. The owners, who have moved to Australia, bought the place several years ago without the help of a broker. They paid $2.1 million, thinking that the apartment had 2,100 square feet. The size estimate included the 700-square-foot backyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they went to sell, Ms. Katzen said, the owners were disappointed to learn that outdoor space is not typically counted as part of overall square footage. So instead of 2,100 square feet, the apartment is listed at 1,400 square feet, and priced at $1.85 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters are often swayed by square-footage figures, said Clifford Finn, the managing director for new developments at CitiHabitats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Renters don't necessarily calculate the rent based on price per square foot,'' he said. ''But often, they will come in with a very specific idea of how much square footage they need.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, more often than not, neither the renter nor the landlord in older buildings has any idea of the true size of an apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In more than half the walk-up apartments in Manhattan,'' he said, ''no one knows the true square footage. And renters will come in saying they cannot live in less than 750 square feet, but will have no idea what 750 square feet is. You show them something that is 640 feet and they are like, 'This is great.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even for professionals, square footage can still hold surprises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said that when her company was renewing its lease on office space in SoHo, the landlord came to her with unexpected news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were paying rent based on 12,000 square feet,'' Ms. Liebman recalled. ''He said, 'Your space is now measured at 14,000 square feet.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landlord wanted to charge more based on the new calculation. Ms. Liebman replied that the space had not magically grown 2,000 feet overnight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had a war over it,'' she said. The landlord eventually relented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it was commercial real estate -- which has a different set of rules when it comes to measuring square footage, as well as its own, often more egregious, variations in measurements -- it offered a reminder of just how unreliable size estimates can be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we have all become too obsessed with dollars per square foot,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''Smart buyers should look carefully at the offering plans or have the apartment measured themselves.'' And, she added, always keep in mind that ''everyone seems to have a different tape measure.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties</span> buckled under a mountain of debt and filed for bankruptcy last year, deal watchers assumed that Simon Properties, the nation's largest mall owner, would swoop in and buy it. So many people were stunned when <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management</span>, a lesser-known company that is based in Toronto, beat out Simon last May and snagged a major ownership stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The victory catapulted B.A.M. -- and its chief executive, Bruce Flatt -- onto the A-list of United States real estate investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flatt, often dubbed the Warren Buffett of Canada, is hailed as a numbers guru with an eye for spotting distressed assets and a knack for negotiating deals that deliver big, industry-beating returns and stable cash flows. He's also been called a ''benevolent dictator'' for his hands-on approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company, though not unscathed by the recession, escaped without major debt problems during the credit crisis, unlike many of its peers. So while many rivals were struggling to refinance expiring loans, Brookfield was raising billions in hopes of picking up attractive assets at fire-sale prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flatt is ''among a handful of the smartest people in Canada,'' says David Peterson, a former premier of Ontario and a senior partner and chairman of the law firm <span class="companylink">Cassels Brock &amp; Blackwell</span>, -- as well as a neighbor of Mr. Flatt in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The publicity-shy Mr. Flatt, 45, is modest when asked about his role in his company's success. ''This organization is not really about me,'' he says in a rare interview while sitting in an 11th-floor conference room at the World Financial Center in Manhattan, the headquarters of Brookfield Office Properties, a B.A.M. spin-off. ''Many organizations are built upon one person, but this organization could survive tomorrow morning without me -- I truly believe that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts agree that <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management</span> has a deep and highly talented management team, but they also say Mr. Flatt was responsible for assembling it. Many of the senior executives, including him, are accountants by trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are well-scrubbed M.B.A. types as opposed to lift-them-up-by-the-bootstrap developers,'' says Jim Sullivan, a managing director and senior analyst at Cowen &amp; Company, an investment banking and advisory firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flatt, a lean 6 feet tall, shuns the flamboyant persona adopted by real estate moguls like Donald Trump. Divorced and in a long-term relationship with the art adviser and socialite Lonti Ebers, he works 12-hour days and is constantly traveling between his homes in Toronto and New York, as well as making trips around the world to scout new deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flatt is animated when talking about his businesses but terse when questions turn to his personal interests. (''How do you relax?'' ''I read business books.'' ''What's your favorite one?'' ''I don't have one.'' ''Do you listen to music?'' ''No.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEFORE he took over in 2002, <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management</span> was a complicated conglomerate with holdings that included a beer company and Brazilian cattle ranches. Mr. Flatt led a restructuring that simplified B.A.M. by focusing on just three sectors: real estate, renewable power and infrastructure assets like ports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flatt sees himself as investing in the ''backbone infrastructure'' of the economy. ''We're not a retail brand, but we rent space in malls to companies,'' he says. ''We don't sell coal to anybody, but we own their coal terminal and ship coal out of our coal terminal. And we don't sell natural gas but we transport natural gas in our pipelines.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company now has $110 billion in assets under management, having bought assets and controlling interests in businesses with a combination of equity capital, private equity funds and debt. By raising money alongside big-name partners like sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, it squeezes out bigger returns on its equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.A.M.'s stock has generated average annual returns of 23 percent over the last 10 years, outpacing the 1.35 percent average for the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index, and the nearly 11 percent return of the real estate sector, according to Morningstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its shares sold off with the broader market in 2008, even though experts now say its fundamentals were solid. While other companies were struggling with debt issues, B.A.M. was able to raise $1.2 billion in 2008 and $14 billion in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It holds controlling stakes in several publicly traded companies, including Brookfield Office Properties, which was spun off from the parent in 1997 and owns such prestigious properties as the World Financial Center towers. <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span> was known for falling a few dollars short of the winning bid for the World Trade Center lease -- just months before the Twin Towers came crashing down -- and for the lightning-speed clean-up and reopening of the four damaged properties it owned adjacent to the trade center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brookfield Office Properties (it recently changed its name from just <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span>) is a real estate operating company for tax reasons but competes head-to-head with office real estate investment trusts. It has been a star in its own right. It posted total returns of 68 percent in 2009 and is up an additional 45 percent this year. It managed to refinance $2.5 billion in expiring debt in 2008 and 2009, and raised about $1 billion in equity despite the credit crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ric Clark, the C.E.O. of Brookfield Office Properties, says lenders opened their wallets because of its high-quality properties in major markets, its long-term leases and healthy cash flows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among its peers in the office real estate sector, Brookfield Office Properties has by far the strongest average two-year performance in stock returns, occupancy levels and operating income growth, says Mr. Sullivan at Cowen &amp; Company. It has outperformed rivals like Vornado and Boston Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in recent months, a crack has appeared in B.A.M.'s sturdy armor. Investor unrest erupted in late July, when <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span> unveiled plans to acquire an Australian portfolio of office properties owned by B.A.M. and sell its residential business to a unit of B.A.M. without an auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span>' stock fell 13 percent as concerns about conflicts arose. Analysts questioned who benefited more from the deal -- the parent or the real estate stepchild. The news made many analysts wonder whether Mr. Flatt was running the show behind the scenes and dictating what <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span> and other B.A.M.-controlled companies could be bought or sold, and when. (The issue is further complicated because Brookfield's C.E.O., Mr. Clark, also holds an executive position at B.A.M.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was this episode that prompted Michael Knott, a managing director at Green Street Advisors, to call Mr. Flatt a benevolent dictator. ''Investors expressed their concerns with their feet by getting out of the stock,'' says Mr. Knott, adding that this was the first time potential conflicts had become an issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock rebounded a few weeks later, though. Investors saw the potential upside in turning <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span> into a pure-play international office company and having it invest in the Australian market, where the economy is growing and rental rates are rising much faster than they are in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flatt bristles at being dubbed a benevolent dictator, emphasizing his company's team approach. There may be some who question the relationship and potential conflicts between the two companies, he says, but an equal number of investors are bullish about Brookfield Office Properties precisely because of B.A.M.'s ties to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He acknowledges that he takes a hands-on approach to the companies in which B.A.M. invests, but he makes no apologies. ''Look, we're an active investor in businesses,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BORN in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Mr. Flatt grew up in a financial environment. His father, Ian, was a senior executive at the Investors Group mutual fund empire for 43 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flatt flexed his entrepreneurial muscles early on. While many college students were taking jobs at bars and restaurants, he started his own business -- a lawn-cutting enterprise -- that won him an ''entrepreneur of the year'' award at the University of Manitoba, where he was studying to be an accountant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After his graduation in 1985, his congenial personality and acumen with numbers convinced Scott Wotherspoon to hire him at Clarkson Gordon (later bought by <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span>). ''He was very social -- a party guy -- that you'd like to go out and have a beer with,'' Mr. Wotherspoon says. At work, ''he was articulate, knowledgeable and quick-thinking in his answers to questions -- his brilliance shone out,'' Mr. Wotherspoon says. ''He had a personality that drew people to him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flatt passed his accounting exam with the second-highest marks in the province, then joined the conglomerate Brascan, later renamed <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management</span>. There, he distinguished himself early on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1993, at 28, he led B.A.M.'s bid to acquire a chunk of prime office properties from the United States unit of the debt-ridden <span class="companylink">Olympia &amp; York Developments</span> in bankruptcy court. That bankruptcy was among the largest and most complicated insolvencies in the pre-Enron era, recalls Tom Falus, now C.E.O. of Sienna Capital, who worked for Olympia &amp; York at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flatt ''was really, really young -- I don't want to call him a kid -- but he was the youngest kid on the block by a lot,'' Mr. Falus says. Yet, he recalls, Mr. Flatt had no trouble going head-to-head with real estate heavyweights like Jerry Speyer of Tishman Speyer Properties, who sat across the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal, which took about four years to hammer out, gave <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span> control of 11 million square feet of premium office properties, including three of the four World Financial Center towers and 245 Park Avenue in New York as well as an office building in Boston -- all at low prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To put this in perspective, 245 Park Avenue, which was valued at $400 million in 1996, is worth more than $1.6 billion today, Mr. Flatt says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that victory, Mr. Flatt was promoted to chief executive of <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span> in 2000 and then C.E.O. of B.A.M. in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT is Mr. Flatt's friendly yet tenacious negotiating style that drives much of his success at the deal table, people who have sat across from him say. Unlike some real estate titans, ''he doesn't care about bragging rights or making the other guy look bad or crushing his skull under his boot,'' says Jim Corl, a managing director at Siguler Guff &amp; Company, a private equity investment firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His persuasiveness is evident outside the boardroom, too. On the day of the 2001 terrorist attacks, a distraught Mr. Flatt hired a car to take him from Toronto to Manhattan. Even though all the bridges into Manhattan were closed, he talked his way through all the security checkpoints to check on his employees. ''We had a lot of people here and we didn't know what had happened to them,'' he recalls. ''There was literally no communications with people for days.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span> didn't lose faith in its investments in Lower Manhattan after the attacks. In 2002, it acquired <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>' ownership stake in one of the World Financial Center towers as frightened tenants were leaving Manhattan. Brookfield bought Lehman's interest for $128 a square foot, says Mr. Clark, and today a similar Class A building slightly north of the area, 111 Eighth Avenue, recently fetched more than $600 a foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flatt's specialty is pulling off complex deals -- as was clear during the Olympia &amp; York negotiations, and more recently during his showdown with the <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span> for <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The General Growth battle wasn't the first time Mr. Flatt butted heads with Simon. In 2007, B.A.M. made a bid for the Mills Corporation, a retail real estate investment trust, but was later trumped by Simon (although Brookfield did pocket a $71 million profit related to a debt investment and breakup fee).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when B.A.M. made a play for General Growth and Simon tried to jump into the fray again, Mr. Flatt was ready. B.A.M. had begun to lay the groundwork two years earlier, in 2008, when it offered to inject $1 billion into General Growth when it was first showing signs of debt trouble. By the time General Growth filed for Chapter 11 in 2009, he had cozied up to the board and earned its trust along with a seat at the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flatt then fired off a letter to the board, saying Simon's only interest was in swallowing up the company so it could control about a third of the country's shopping malls, and that B.A.M. would simply recapitalize it, letting it remain a stand-alone company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also warned that Simon's bid would set off antitrust issues that could delay or even scuttle the deal's close. As a result, even when Simon offered a higher bid this year, the board threw its hat in with Brookfield. Simon declined to comment for this article.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may surprise Chicago's mayoral candidates, but Chris Kennedy, lord of a showroom and convention empire, urges that we all think inside the box.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kennedy, president of Merchandise Mart Properties Inc., was in his Mart office last week explaining the global context from which to view Chicago's present and future -- notwithstanding the encroaching deluge of budget deficits and pension liabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Chair designs,'' he said simply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I harked back to the scene in ''The Graduate'' in which a boyish Dustin Hoffman is counseled by a smug businessman: ''I just want to say one word to you. Just one word. 'Plastics.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There have been enormous changes in chair designs,'' said Mr. Kennedy, 47, who runs one of the world's largest producers of trade and consumer shows, itself a source of his famous family's good fortune. ''And I'd submit that incredibly influential decisions in design have to do with how a chair fits into the cubes in shipping containers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Globalism thus affects ''your tush,'' said Mr. Kennedy, a son of former Senator Robert F. Kennedy, but it also affects the Mart and all of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wanted to sit down -- on any chair -- and talk after hearing him here at a worldwide gathering of elected officials, planners and businessmen. Introducing both a United Nations under secretary general and a former mayor of Sao Paulo, Brazil, Mr. Kennedy had been so intriguing in alluding to the nuts-and-bolts nexus of the world economy that I wanted him to elaborate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty years ago, he said, the Mart's real estate competitors were mostly along LaSalle Street or Wacker Drive, and its trade shows competed with those in Dallas, Atlanta and Las Vegas. Now its real estate rivals are huge real estate investment trusts in Boston and New York, as well as funds in Canada and California and real estate firms as far away as Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Chicago's predictably anticlimactic faux news of the week -- Rahm Emanuel's residency hearing -- which included Mr. Emanuel's mention of his wife's wedding gown being stored in their basement here, bridal gowns were a coincidentally relevant topic. At the Mart, the gowns issue is a much more serious and global matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The granddaddy of bridal gown shows is held at the Mart each fall. Two years ago, American companies, which were importing much from China, hit the limit on the finished-goods fabric products that could enter the United States without stiff tariffs. That meant those companies could not participate in the two annual bridal trade shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there was the recession's impact on the falling price of nylon. As a result, <span class="companylink">Koch Industries</span>, a conglomerate that has gained notice for huge contributions to Republicans, closed a chunk of its European nylon extrusion business central to making carpets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Koch became more cautious about adding showroom space at the Mart, as well as retail space on Clybourn Avenue and back-office space in the South Loop. Delaying decisions, shortening lease spans and decreasing build-outs meant less work for carpenters, painters, electricians and Mr. Kennedy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kennedy seemed as prepared for me as Tom Brady was for his evisceration of the Bears last Sunday. He took out photos of landmark steel high-rises -- the Willis Tower, Hancock Center and Lake Point Tower -- and then led me to a corner window looking east.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He pointed toward new, mostly residential, high-rises largely built of concrete. Chinese demand for iron ore and steel affects the way we design. We've abandoned our Mies van der Rohe ''roots,'' Mr. Kennedy said, and our city looks different.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are inevitable family mementos in his office, including a poster from a 1968 fund-raiser for his dad's presidential campaign at which Sonny and Cher and the Byrds performed. He is, after all, a genetically political animal who toyed with running for President Obama's old Senate seat last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His father even cast a shadow on his chairmanship of the University of Illinois board of trustees. In September, the board denied William Ayers, the 1960s radical, emeritus faculty status after Mr. Kennedy argued that Mr. Ayers had dedicated a book to, among many others, the man who killed his father in 1968.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a fervent, if debatable, decision. But Mr. Kennedy appears to be a smart and passionate fellow -- and droll about idiosyncratic family members we know in common. He cares about the city and wonders if we just don't understand our place in a global environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cited the ''cheap shots'' of politician critics of Mayor Richard M. Daley who chide his extensive overseas travels. Mr. Kennedy's implicit point was obvious and inarguable: It's a big world out there.</p>

</div><div class="author">By VIVIAN MARINO   </div><div>890 words</div><div>19 December 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Himmel, 56, is a managing partner at Himmel + Meringoff Properties, which owns and operates more than two million square feet of office and retail space in New York City, including 521-33 West 57th Street and 729 Seventh Avenue. Ms. Himmel is active on the Real Estate Board of New York, serving as chairwoman of its Economic Development Committee, which she founded in 1992.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What are your main responsibilities at Himmel + Meringoff?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Stephen Meringoff and I have been partners for 26 years -- as of January -- and we both can substitute for each other in the business. But I take more of the outside role, working with brokers and lenders to bring in deals. Steve is the in-house person. He does the work with the leasing and the management and the renovation; he helps organize the strategic thinking for the repositioning of the properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How did you and Mr. Meringoff meet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We met at a class that Larry Silverstein taught at N.Y.U. Harry Helmsley was a guest speaker and going on and on about his buildings. And when he asked if there were any questions, I raised my hand first and I asked about his greatest accomplishment, to which he replied, ''What are you doing later tonight?'' After that, Steve came over to me and thought I had a lot of moxie and we struck it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Did Harry Helmsley later serve as sort of a mentor?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A A lot of the long-term owners in real estate were my mentors, and they all took me under their wing. Larry Silverstein was and continues to be a mentor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But getting back to Harry Helmsley, I went on a vacation to Barbados a year after my partnership with Steve, and who was at the same hotel? Harry and Leona. My husband and I got very close with them -- we had lunch and dinner with them almost every day -- and Harry told me stories the entire week. Coming back home on the plane I wrote them all down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Like many of the family real estate businesses, your firm is conservative with financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We're very conservative. Our L.T.V., or loan to value, is probably 50 to 60 percent, at most, maybe only 30 or 40 percent. We do like to finance our properties, because taxwise it's the smart thing to do to have interest as a deduction. With interest rates today at 4.5 to 5 percent, it's really smart to refinance everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q And your firm also tends to buy and hold properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We typically hold for a long term, similar to the real estate families. However, from 2000 to 2009 we did sell a number of properties. We believe there's a time to buy and there's a time to sell -- and at this point we're back in the buying mode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Are you working on any distressed opportunities?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I have over 20 properties that we're working on now -- some with lenders, some are net leases, some are pure purchases. I'm in different stages on a lot of deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Tell me about some of the deals for this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A In the spring we extended a net lease on 411 Lafayette Street, off Astor Place, by another 25 years, to 2061. Originally it was 49 years, and it was expiring in 2036. It's a beautiful 90,000-square-foot building that was built in 1898. We also refinanced three properties. And we just signed a contract on a secondary office building in Manhattan. I'm under a confidentiality statement. We were chosen because of the ability to close all-cash and close quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Do you have any favorites in your property portfolio?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A People say never fall in love with your real estate. I do have a lot of very interesting -- highly complicated and structured -- transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's one building at 1356 Broadway -- it's now Gotham Hall -- that took me 10 years to buy. It was through four transactions: I bought the fee from an Integrated Resources interest; we bought the lease and the mortgage from Republic; and we bought a remainder interest that had the air rights from another entity. We ended up selling the property but retain the air rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Let's put your Rebny hat on and talk about New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New York has been really lucky in seeing a recovery, in large part because Wall Street had a banner year this year. I do believe that New York City also has this fantastic intellectual capital, and as much as it may be cheaper to do business in other places, there's this wonderful synergy here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are really trying to get New York City to have better tax and economic incentives to compete with places like North Carolina to get businesses here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q So you're to receive a Rebny lifetime leadership award next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A It was my dream to follow in the footsteps of these huge leaders. So is it time to retire?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the developers set out to build 15 Central Park West, which has become something of a personality in its own right in a city obsessed with real estate, they were gambling that the rich and famous would embrace an aesthetic that evoked New York of the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was 2005. And 15 Central Park West was going up as architects like Richard Meier were being celebrated for designing shimmering glass towers downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the developers, working with the architect Robert A.M. Stern, went out on something of a limestone limb, paying homage to Rosario Candela-designed buildings like 740 Park Avenue and other traditional residences on Fifth Avenue. The 201-unit condominium, which actually includes two buildings, is often referred to as ''limestone clad.'' But there is clad and then there is clad: the exteriors of the buildings, one with 19 stories and called ''the house'' and the other a 35-floor tower, are covered with 87,000 pieces of Indiana limestone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Web site Curbed.com refers to 15 Central Park West, between 61st and 62nd Streets, as the ''Limestone Jesus.'' For any broker sweating it out in this market, a listing at 15 Central Park West is nothing short of a coup, and a sale can indeed be a savior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at the transactions that have taken place in the last month - in one of the sleepiest seasons on the real estate calendar - shows that 15 Central Park West has sustained its status as a real estate success story at a time when ''real estate'' and ''success story'' rarely appear in the same sentence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the location - with many of the units having panoramic views of the park, and the draw of having celebrity neighbors like Sanford I. Weill, the former chief executive of <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, or Sting - 15 Central Park West is where Hollywood meets hedge fund moguls. It ''seems to have hit all the hot buttons well-to-do people were looking for,'' said Richard Wallgren of Brown Harris Stevens, the condo's original director of sales, and a resident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Brown Harris Stevens, which manages the condo, produces its quarterly market reports for the Upper West side, it publishes two: One that includes 15 Central Park West and one that doesn't. The condominium's prices skew the picture. (The brokerage no longer separates from the reports the Plaza Hotel residences, a project that along with 15 Central Park West was considered one of the most ambitious residential developments in the city's history, because it has since stumbled.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last month, one of 15 Central Park West's 24 maid's suites, which are available for purchase only to residents, sold for $2.6 million. The sale price for that suite, a 900-square-foot one-bedroom on the park, is not shocking. But consider that the same apartment sold for $1 million in 2008, according to city records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(The sale of the maid's quarters was first reported by Curbed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the penthouse owned by William Lie Zeckendorf, who, along with his brother, Arthur W. Zeckendorf, developed and reside at 15 Central Park West. William Zeckendorf paid $10.7 million for his apartment, according to property records, and recently signed a contract with a buyer who is paying about $40 million. (The transaction was first reported by The New York Post and confirmed by brokers briefed on the deal.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That amounts to slightly more than $9,000 per square foot, according to the brokers. (He has made an offer on an apartment at 927 Fifth Avenue for a four-bedroom listed at $27 million by Brown Harris Stevens, according to brokers familiar with the offer. It is being sold by the estate of Bruce Wasserstein, the chairman and chief executive of Lazard until his death last year.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A three-bedroom at 15 Central Park West went into contract on Dec. 9, having been listed by Brown Harris Stevens in mid-October at an asking price of $16.5 million; a four-bedroom there went on the market last month for $31.5 million. Flipping for a profit in this market seems archaic, if not impossible, but the practice is alive and well at 15 Central Park West, several brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its sale prices are leaving neighboring residences like the <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center in the dust. Properties at the Warner Center are closing at an average of $3,339 per square foot, a drop of almost $1,000 since just before the fall of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> in 2008, according to data from Property Shark. The average asking price per square foot is $5,629. Units at 15 Central Park West are closing at $4,712 per square foot, while the average asking price is $5,024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Flipping is 2007 thinking,'' said Mark Chin, a broker with Citi Habitats who specializes in high-end properties but does not have a listing at 15 Central Park West. ''It's really only happening in this building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no flip tax, but any resident who sells in the condominium is required to pay two months in maintenance fees into a working capital reserve fund, Mr. Wallgren said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Arthur Zeckendorf said he wanted to look at classic buildings like the Dakota, or 834 Fifth Avenue or 740 Park Avenue, ''and figure out, analyze what is so nice about the building. You take the apartments, you dissect the apartment, the foyers, the relationship of the kitchen to the dining room to the library to the living room and the children's wing. And you try to design a product that today's buyer will pay a premium for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brothers have begun a new project, a conversion of the former Salvation Army building at 18 Gramercy Park South, also with Mr. Stern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They can only hope to retell the story of 15 Central Park West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights from this week's Real Estate section: When it comes to measuring the square footage of New York City apartments, the tale told by the tape can be exaggerated, massaged, misrepresented and manipulate; on Staten Island, George Burke fell in love with a mansion when he was a youth and eventually became not only the grand old house's owner, but its protector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: December 26, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A report in the Big Deal column last Sunday about the success of resales at 15 Central Park West, a condominium in Manhattan developed by William Lie Zeckendorf and his brother, Arthur W. Zeckendorf, misidentified one of the classic Fifth Avenue buildings that served as an inspiration for 15 Central Park West. It was No. 834, not No. 854.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Housing starts in the United States rose slightly more than expected in November, but permits for future home construction fell to an 18-month low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that first-time claims for jobless benefits were essentially unchanged in the latest week, continuing a recent downward trend, but remaining too modest to bring down unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the housing report, the Commerce Department said that housing starts rose 3.9 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 555,000 units. October's starts were revised up to a 534,000-unit pace from the previously reported 519,000 units, which was an 18-month low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Reuters had expected housing starts to rise to a 550,000-unit rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite last month's pickup in residential construction, housing remains weak as a 9.8 percent unemployment rate weighs on demand and homeowners' ability to hang on to their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New building permits fell 4 percent, to a 530,000-unit rate last month, the lowest since April 2009, after a 0.9 percent increase in October. Permits were dragged down by a 23 percent decline in the volatile multifamily segment. Permits for single-family homes rose 3 percent last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts had expected building permits to rise to a 560,000-unit rate in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreaking last month was lifted by a 6.9 percent increase in single-family home construction. Starts for the multifamily segment, however, fell 9.1 percent. New home completions fell 14.1 percent to a record low 513,000 units in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the jobs report, the Labor Department said that initial claims dipped slightly to 420,000 last week, matching the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, from a revised 423,000 in the previous week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, continuing claims, which exclude the millions of Americans relying on extended benefits, rose to 4.14 million in the week ended Dec. 4. That was far higher than the reading of 4.07 million analysts had expected, and the previous week's figure was also revised up considerably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total number of Americans claiming benefits, including those relying on a federal emergency program of extended benefits that has been the subject of heated political debate in Washington, rose by nearly 900,000, to 9.2 million on a nonseasonally adjusted basis in the week to Nov. 27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Business Outlook Survey showed that manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region continued to improve in December. All of the broad indicators remained positive and suggest an expansion of activity. The index increased to 24.3 in December from 22.5 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increases in input prices were more widespread this month, and more firms reported increases in prices for their manufactured goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey's broad indicators of future activity suggest that optimism among the region's manufacturing executives also continues to improve.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent batch of economic data has been quite positive. On Thursday alone, three different reports showed that initial jobless claims had fallen, housing starts and the issuance of building permits had both risen and a Federal Reserve index of manufacturing activity rose too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before getting too excited about these trends, let's think back to the early part of this year. Back then, initial jobless claims were falling. Housing starts and the issuance of building permits were rising. A Federal Reserve index of manufacturing activity was rising too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then what happened? The recovery stopped. Some people blame the debt crisis in Europe (which, of course, has not ended). Others think we'll never know exactly what stopped the recovery, because the aftermath of a financial crisis tends to be difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That last point is important. Yes, the latest data has been good. But the economy remains both weak and vulnerable. The notion that a couple of weeks of decent news should cause the Fed to proclaim victory and halt its campaign to lift growth -- a notion you're starting to hear -- seems misplaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the thoughtful Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist of the Economic Outlook Group, in a note to clients: Clearly, the economy continues to move in the right direction. What troubles me is that the Federal Reserve doesn't fully realize the nuanced relationship it has with the bond market as this criticalstage in the recovery....</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[I]f the declarative goal of the Fed is to use the $600 billion in QE2 simply to lower the unemployment rate even as an economic recovery is underway, then it risks agitating the bond market who fear the central bank may overshoot by adding yet more money when the financial system is already flooded with excess reserves. Such anxieties will drive market rates higher, raise the cost of capital, and ultimately undermining the Fed's own goals.These are legitimate concerns. As Mr. Bauhmol suggests, the Fed needs to make sure that bond investors know it stands ready to withdraw its support for the economy -- and let interest rates rise -- as soon as the recovery seems assured. Otherwise, the bond market will get spooked about inflation and send long-term rates up on its own, thereby putting the recovery at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are no free lunches here. If the Fed immediately halted its efforts to lift growth (like the bond-buying program known as QE2), the recovery might die out, just as it did earlier this year. The Fed's job here is to judge the relative risk of various problems. So far, the bond markets show little sign of being agitated. Read Martin Wolf, Mark Thoma or Jeremy Siegel for more on this point: the recent rise in rates isn't really about inflation worries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, the recovery remains nascent and vulnerable. Any number of factors -- Ireland, Spain, a post-holiday consumer pullback in the United States -- could cause problems. Given all this, the Fed would seem to be taking a bigger risk by ending QE2 than by continuing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Put it this way: When the last monthly jobs report showed a gain of only 39,000 jobs, far less than needed to keep up with population growth, economic weakness still appears to be the main reason for concern.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In real estate, this is the season to obsess about the bonus season. Wall Street bonuses, in the pre-housing-crash years, were a major economic engine driving sales in the city from January through the spring. They can be a broker's bread and butter -- brioche with brie, really, when you're talking about multimillion-dollar bonuses and multimillion-dollar apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since the economy melted down, bonuses have been up, down and spinning all around. Anticipation has had brokerages and developers panting one minute and totally depressed the next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the speculation this year over bonuses has been unusually intense; the question of Congress's extending or eliminating Bush-era tax breaks that have been in place for much of the last decade has only fueled conjecture. Will bonus payouts come early this year so the recipients can avoid potential tax increases?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, President Obama and Congressional Republicans announced a preliminary deal to extend the tax cuts for another two years, as part of a compromise that would include extending unemployment benefits and cutting payroll taxes for all workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sellers, particularly developers of new condominiums, have already seized on the early-bonus scenario. But judging from some recent offers, if it's a bonus bonanza, it's an unusual one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider what's coming out of Harlem. A recent press release from the developers of 2280 FDB, a new condo in Central Harlem, on Frederick Douglass Boulevard between West 122nd and 123 Streets, said buyers ''anticipating big holiday payouts this year'' could receive 10 percent of their bonus amount -- up to $25,000 -- in concessions if they signed a contract on selected apartments before Dec. 20 and closed before Feb. 28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But wait. Over at 88 Morningside, a new development also in Central Harlem, at Morningside Avenue and West 122nd Street, buyers who do not get a bonus can get a $10,000 discount if they sign a contract between now and Jan. 31 on a one-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, there's the ''save your bonus!'' option at Embelesar 118, in East Harlem, at 118th Street and Lexington Avenue, which is offering six months of free maintenance if buyers sign a contract by Jan. 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to make of all of this? Well, high, low or nonexistent, bonuses are a smart marketing tool, a ''hook surrounding something everyone understands,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and a market analyst for Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, Mr. Miller said, no matter what happens with the size of bonuses or the tax breaks, sellers should remain cautious. Those who are clinging to the possibility of bonuses, he said, may want to take into account that ''the bonus thing is not anything like it was, because so much of it is as restricted stock options versus cash. Yet everyone still sees it as a panacea.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, in this market and this economy, erstwhile panaceas are not what they may seem. And as one adage suggests, there is nothing louder than the sound of a halo crashing down from the head of an erstwhile angel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the bonuses have had brokers and developers abuzz, another obsession has been rippling through the real estate world over the past week: discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As The New York Observer first reported on Monday and city records confirm, a penthouse at 100 11th Avenue in West Chelsea, a high-rise designed by the architect Jean Nouvel, sold to an undisclosed buyer for $13.2 million, $3.7 million less than the $16.9 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discounts are nothing new, particularly in the luxury market of the post-housing-crash era. And the developers of 100 11th, Cape Advisors, have swallowed several big ones this year: four apartments in the building, at West 19th Street, sold in June and July for about 24 and 30 percent less than the asking prices, according to sales records on</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Streeteasy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leonard Steinberg, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman who specializes in West Chelsea, said the $13.2 million deal at 100 11th was both a ''good buy and a good sell.'' The apartment, which is not finished -- unfinished apartments are much less likely to sell in this market -- commanded a premium price, he said, comparing it with similar properties selling in the neighborhood. (The unit was listed by Prudential Douglas Elliman, but not by Mr. Steinberg.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why all the fuss now over a 20 percent-or-so discount? First, the high-end market -- apartments listed for $10 million or more -- has been steadily gaining strength in 2010, especially over the last two months, and this discount might seem like a reversal. And those price cuts last June and July were not surprising in a soft summer market, particularly with new developments, including the Nouvel building, and the luxury niche's being strangled by the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, from the standpoint of a new field of study known as behavioral real estate, which is examining the psychology of buying and selling property as a social science of its own, discounts can have a hugely persuasive effect on future buyers who will expect similar deals. They can also create fears of plunging values among those who have already bought in the same building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not to say that sellers are not purposely inflating prices so buyers can then revel in the rush of, say, saving almost $4 million. This is an age-old, not-so-subtle psychological tactic that has been used widely used during the recession to sell everything from designer shoes to designer penthouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You will feel like a sucker if you pay retail in this market,'' said Michael J. Seiler, a professor and the Robert M. Stanton Endowed Chair of Real Estate and Economic Development at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., and a leading researcher in behavioral real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is how what he calls ''psychological pricing'' works: In a weak market, sellers may intentionally overprice a property to create ''the illusion of a huge discount.'' In a strong market, they may intentionally underprice a property to create a bidding war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing may seem like a commodity that has a somewhat objective value; for example, a buyer could rely on a yardstick like the asking price per square foot of an apartment, and compare it with the sale price per square foot of similar properties in the same neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the connection between branding and buying in real estate is not so different from the one in the rest of the retail world. In New York City, especially, a building designed by a prize-winning architect can be considered a coveted brand as can an address. So a discount on a property in such a building, or at an address like 768 Fifth Avenue, the Plaza Hotel residences, will have a greater impact on consumer confidence than one on a less popular brand, according to brokers and consumer behavior experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, a StreetEasy analysis of sales transactions filed with the city since Dec. 1 showed that among the other fairly steep price cuts on high-end properties was a nearly 16 percent cut on a two-bedroom condo at the Plaza, which was last listed in September at $10.9 million and sold for $9.2 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- At the peak of the real estate frenzy in early 2007, the New York-based real estate company Tishman Speyer paid $200 million for land to build a Silicon Valley-style office park in Playa Vista, a new community rising on this city's West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As sometimes occurs in real estate deals, the 64-acre site came with something Tishman Speyer did not really want: the huge hangar where in the 1940s Howard Hughes built the 200-ton birch wood flying boat that came to be known as the Spruce Goose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following year, Tishman Speyer, the owner of Rockefeller Center, and its financial partner, Walton Street Capital of Chicago, decided to sell the hangar, which had been used for years as a movie and television sound stage. ''We don't pretend to know that business,'' an executive told The Los Angeles Times when the hangar went on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, thanks to the decline in real estate values, the hangar has a new owner, Wayne Ratkovich, one of the first developers in Los Angeles to recognize the value in restoring historic buildings. Mr. Ratkovich plans to redevelop the cavernous structure, which measures 204 feet by 700 feet, as the centerpiece of a complex of sound stages and offices geared to entertainment companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ratkovich did not buy the hangar and the 10 other World War II-era Hughes buildings from Tishman Speyer, however. In 2009, Tishman Speyer defaulted on its $155 million loan and had to surrender most of its property in Playa Vista, which is about three miles north of Los Angeles International Airport on land formerly owned by Mr. Hughes. The New York company, which also lost the 110-building Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village apartment complex on the East Side of Manhattan through foreclosure earlier this year, kept the four Playa Vista office buildings it had already completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Playa Vista property was sold in three separate chunks. Mr. Ratkovich and his financial backer, Penwood Real Estate Investment Management of Hartford, Conn., paid $32.4 million in cash for 28 acres that included the old buildings. <span class="companylink">Lincoln Property Company</span> of Dallas, which has developed 488,000 square feet of new office space at Playa Vista, bought 10.5 acres for future expansion, paying 14 cents for every dollar of Tishman's 2006 acquisition price, said David S. Binswanger, an executive vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third buyer was Tishman Speyer itself, which reacquired for $35 million 19 of the acres it had given back. Company officials declined to be interviewed but had said previously that they had no immediate plan for the site. The vacancy rate for prime buildings on the West Side, including sublet space, stood at 18.4 percent in the third quarter, according to the brokerage firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William J. Hoffman, the president of Trigild, of San Diego, the court-appointed receiver, said it was unusual for an owner to reacquire property it had lost in a foreclosure. The practice is even banned in some jurisdictions so that the borrower does not profit at the expense of the lender. ''In my experience of over 30 years, it's very uncommon,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''In this case, this was the best solution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focus of one of the most protracted development battles in Los Angeles history because of its proximity to the fragile Ballona Wetlands to the west of Lincoln Boulevard, Playa Vista is finally taking shape as a master-planned community. Its 6,000 residents, including more families than had been anticipated, live in blocks of four-story buildings amid parks, shops and a library branch. A school is under construction. A shopping center is planned but has been stalled because of litigation, said Patricia T. Sinclair, co-president of the community's master developer, Playa Capital Company, whose partners include <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and Oaktree Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the Los Angeles City Council approved an additional 2,800 residential units, the final phase of a development project that was first proposed (by a previous owner) in 1978. In the last three years, Tishman Speyer and Lincoln have created one million square feet of low-rise office space aimed at attracting the type of new-media companies that flocked to the West Side during the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One selling point is a recently completed eight-acre park with a band shell and amphitheater designed by the Los Angeles architect Michael Maltzan, a sand volleyball court, a soccer field and a basketball court. Tenants include the electronics company <span class="companylink">Belkin International</span> and the Institute for Creative Technologies of the University of Southern California, a military contractor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, in what had seemed like a major coup for Playa Vista, Fox Interactive Media signed a $350 million long-term lease for 420,000 square feet at Lincoln Property's Horizon complex. But the decline of its social media site, MySpace, led Fox Interactive to trim its staff and cancel the move. The company, which is using only 50,000 square feet at the moment, is obligated to pay rent of $44 a square foot for the 10.5 years remaining on the lease, Mr. Binswanger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Binswanger said he did not expect Fox Interactive to sublease its empty space -- and thus compete with the remaining space at Horizon -- but even so, the vacancy means that the Playa Vista commercial area is eerily quiet. H. Carl Muhlstein, an executive vice president of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, said these problems were temporary. ''You can't blame Playa Vista for the global meltdown,'' Mr. Muhlstein said. ''The fundamentals of the site are still incredible. That's why the players have doubled down and invested more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Ratkovich, the Hughes buildings represent the latest in a series of redevelopment projects that began more than three decades ago with the 1928 Oviatt building, a former haberdashery on Sixth and Olive Streets in downtown Los Angeles. The success of that project taught him that ''historic architecture can be very marketable,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ratkovich is calling his new project the Hercules Campus, after another name for Mr. Hughes's plane, whose maiden one-mile flight, in 1947, was also its last. (Mr. Hughes, however, ''preferred not to label the plane with such a trade name,'' The New York Times reported on the eve of the flight.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hangar, which looks like an upside-down boat hull, generates over $1 million a year from entertainment companies, Mr. Ratkovich said. As he toured the site with a visitor, it was being used in the filming of the latest of the ''Transformers'' movies (Much of the recent hit ''Avatar'' was shot in one of the other buildings.) But for acoustical reasons, only one shoot can occur in the hangar at any given time. Mr. Ratkovich said he would work with the international engineering company Arup to create separate spaces to accommodate as many as five productions at the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though tenants will be expected to create their own interiors, Mr. Ratkovich plans to invest at least $50 million in rehabilitating the old Hughes structures, including the office used by Mr. Hughes and the cafeteria building where he had a private dining room. Brenda Levin, an architect who worked on the Oviatt and the 1931 Wiltern Theater on Wilshire Boulevard with Mr. Ratkovich, is in charge of the overall design. She said she would enhance the campuslike setting that already existed in Mr. Hughes's day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Binswanger said that Mr. Ratkovich's participation was a boon for Playa Vista. ''This was best possible answer that we could have come up with if we had chosen someone to come in and redevelop those buildings,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development is always a chancy undertaking, and Mr. Ratkovich has had his share of money-losing projects, including the Wiltern. But he said that the fire-sale price he paid for the Hercules site was likely to cushion any risk that project might pose. ''Hopefully, when you purchase the land and the buildings for $60 a square foot,'' he said, ''you're at the level of, 'I don't think I can mess this one up.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: December 9, 2010, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about a plan to redevelop the hangar in Los Angeles where Howard Hughes built the Spruce Goose flying boat described the location of the Ballona Wetlands near the hangar incorrectly. The wetlands are west of Lincoln Boulevard, not east of it.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JANET MORRISSEY </div><div>3174 words</div><div>5 December 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IS this as bad as it gets? For two years, big investors watched the implosion of the lodging industry as hotel values plummeted more than 50 percent. Now as private equity giants like the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> and entrepreneurs like Richard Branson are diving into the sector, others are starting to think it has finally hit bottom and may be bouncing back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackstone teamed up with two other private equity players in May to acquire the Extended Stay hotel chain out of bankruptcy court, and in September, Mr. Branson announced plans to create a Virgin Hotel empire. And when big names reach for their checkbooks, other investors usually aren't far behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far in 2010, there have been 77 lodging deals in the United States valued at $8.5 billion, according to the research firm Dealogic, up from 30 deals valued at $1.2 billion in that period in 2009. (This is still far short of the 2007 peak, when there were 141 deals valued at $42.3 billion -- including the biggest leveraged buyout of a hotel ever, Blackstone's troubled $26 billion purchase of <span class="companylink">Hilton Hotels</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, private equity firms haven't even cracked their piggy banks yet. ''I have never in my entire career seen so much equity on the sidelines ready to pounce,'' says Jim Butler, chairman of the global hospitality group at the law firm Jeffer, Mangels, Butler &amp; Mitchell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 40 private equity funds are hunting for deals in the hotel sector now, and many are under the gun to buy earlier rather than later, says Bjorn Hanson, dean of the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University. About half had cash in hand for lodging investments in 2007 and early 2008 before the sector fell apart and have been sitting on the sidelines, while others have raised money in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All are under pressure to invest, lest they miss the opportunity to jump in before the sector goes into full rebound mode, when ''everybody else gets in and prices get bid up,'' says Mr. Hanson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private equity firms and real estate investment trusts have been building huge war chests over the last year as they seek distressed deals, in the hopes of picking up properties at pennies on the dollar, as many did in the early 1990s recession. Mr. Butler recalls that Colony Capital bought the Hyatt Regency Waikoloa in 1993 in Hawaii for about 12 cents on the dollar. Colony paid $56 million for a property that cost $465 million to build and then sold the property in 2002 for $180 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current downturn, many investors have been waiting for similarly troubled targets, which have yet to materialize. ''I think opportunistic investors had those visions dancing in their head of assets that you buy at 10 cents on the dollar,'' Mr. Butler says. But now many realize they may get distressed assets at only 60 to 80 cents on the dollar, and are afraid they'll miss the rebound if they don't jump in soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things will begin drifting up, if not shooting up,'' Mr. Butler says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotel deals began revving up after the lodging sector showed signs that it had finally turned a corner in the first quarter. Hotels posted year-over-year growth in occupancy in February for the first time since October 2007, and revenue per available room -- a closely watched measurement of room-rate and occupancy growth -- turned positive in March for the first time since July 2008, according to <span class="companylink">Smith Travel Research</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July 2010, American hotels ''sold 102 million room nights, which is the most room nights ever sold in one month,'' noted Jan Freitag, vice president for global development at Smith Travel. ''The worst is behind us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some hotels have even begun selectively raising room rates in recent months, usually a surefire sign that the sector is on the rebound, and experts expect this to escalate in the next two years. At the same time, there's little new construction because financing remains scarce, which will limit the number of new hotel rooms being dumped on the market in the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know we've reached bottom, and we know a recovery has started,'' says Mr. Hanson of N.Y.U. ''Now is the time to start to look seriously at acquisitions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE certainly isn't a shortage of potential targets in the hotel industry. Many lodging companies are struggling to restructure their expiring debt amid dwindling profits, and their lenders -- including almost all the big banks, like <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> -- are groaning under the weight of big loans. Investors abandoned the sector in droves during the downturn, and hotel values plummeted 27 percent in 2008 and a further 40 percent in 2009, according to Colliers PKF Hospitality Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The domestic lodging industry came off of its worst year in history in 2009,'' says Mark Woodworth, president of Colliers, which has been tracking the data since the mid-1930s. Profits tumbled 35.4 percent on average at American hotels last year, a record slide. The previous low-water mark, he says, was a 22.5 percent decline in 1938.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shrinking revenue from falling room rates and occupancy over the last two years sent a flurry of hotel companies, including Extended Stay, <span class="companylink">Innkeepers USA Trust</span>, Highland Hospitality, Red Roof Inn and <span class="companylink">Consolidated Resorts</span>, scrambling for ways to get out from beneath the piles of short-term loans that were suffocating them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many companies had been taken private in debt-heavy deals during the boom years of 2005 to 2007 and are now ''underwater'' -- meaning they are worth less than the debt on their properties, and cash flow from the hotels no longer covers the debt payments, a malady shared by many owners of homes swept up in the foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The level of delinquencies and defaults has been escalating dramatically over the past year or so'' in the lodging industry, Mr. Woodworth says. ''Maybe a third of the problem loan situations have been dealt with at this point, so there's still another two-thirds left to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So this year might just be a turning point for the hotel industry. Smelling blood, private equity firms like Blackstone have swooped into the sector this year, and bitter bidding wars have erupted over properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Extended Stay, a national chain of more than 600 hotels that cater to people seeking longer-term lodging. The company, once valued at more than $8 billion, collapsed under a mountain of debt and dwindling revenue, forcing it to seek bankruptcy protection in June 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom fell out of the industry before the ink was dry, leaving the owner, the Lightstone Group, searching for ways to restructure $7.4 billion in debt. But Lightstone's problems were made worse by the fact that the firm's four lenders had sold the debt in the secondary market to more than 50 creditors, who would have had to agree on any restructuring of the loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We tried for the better part of a year to get them to either reach an agreement or take the keys back, and we just couldn't get them to agree on anything,'' David Lichtenstein, chief executive of the Lightstone Group, says of the creditors. ''Imagine trying to get 50 people to agree with total unanimity on something.'' Instead, creditors were fighting among themselves, with some wanting to change terms and others wanting to take over the hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lichtenstein says he never anticipated such problems. ''We were always told we would be able to give the keys back, but nobody had ever played it out in a real-life situation of what would happen when a loan that was held by this many parties needs a bank to work with or give the keys back to,'' he says. The matter wound up in bankruptcy court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two private equity firms, <span class="companylink">Centerbridge Partners</span> and <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Company</span>, teamed up in March 2010 to acquire the company out of bankruptcy. The firms' initial bid got the nod from Extended Stay's board, and they appeared to have it in the bag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all that changed when Barry Sternlicht, the man behind the W brand and former chairman of the hotel giant <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels and Resorts</span> Worldwide, jumped into the fray later that month with a counterbid, setting off a vicious bidding war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The battle was decided when the Centerbridge team got a third partner, the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, and ultimately clinched the auction with a bid of $3.93 billion in cash and debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Blackstone, the deal was particularly sweet, as the firm had owned Extended Stay and sold it to Lightstone for $8 billion at the top of the market in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One principal involved in the Extended Stay acquisition, whose firm did not want to discuss the deal publicly, said the price was a deep bargain compared with a common benchmark known as replacement cost, which is the theoretical price to build a similar hotel in the same location today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing discounts to replacement costs of 30 percent to 50 percent,'' he says. He says he expects more deals at similar discounts in the next year or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN a September research note, a <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> analyst, Shaun Kelley, said some companies -- like <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels and Resorts</span>, Host Hotels and <span class="companylink">Hersha Hospitality Trust</span> -- would probably be buyers as deals emerged. Several REITs and real estate operating companies, like DiamondRock, Sunstone and Host, have already jumped in by snapping up debt positions in properties that were in default -- the so-called loan-to-own strategy, in which a lender hopes to take over a property if the owner can't meet the debt obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some struggling chains have avoided bankruptcy and 1990s-type fire sales because banks and other lenders have been hoping for a rebound. Lenders have taken an ''extend and pretend'' tactic, in which they extend the loan terms and pretend everything is peachy in the hopes that the underwater loans will be salvageable once the economy bounces back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alvin Wade, a national managing partner at the consulting firm Grant Thornton, who has been advising clients on accounting issues in lodging and real estate for more than 30 years, says most lenders are loath to foreclose on a property because this would require writing down the value of the asset on their books, which could force them to raise additional capital to meet regulatory capital requirements. Also, they don't want to take over the companies and become landlords because, Mr. Wade says, ''the last thing they want to do is be in the real estate business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he says this practice can't go on indefinitely. When ''extend and pretend'' ends, many property owners will be forced to sell or hand the keys back to the lender, and the flow of distressed properties in the market will increase, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Butler, of Jeffer Mangels's global hospitality group, predicts that a wave of hotels and lodging companies could face bankruptcy as Extended Stay did. ''There's still huge amounts of debt coming due in the last half of this year, 2011 and 2012 that will be very difficult to refinance,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Ted Mandigo, a hospitality consultant, says many targets look ripe. ''It's a matter of getting in there early and trying to beat the bidding war,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If those forecasts come true, Mr. Branson, the flamboyant British billionaire who owns an eclectic mix of businesses like airlines and music stores, will have some competition as he buys up hotels to turn into a Virgin chain. He announced plans last month to introduce about 25 Virgin hotels in major cities. He hopes the boutique-style hotel chain will cater to ''high-income, well-educated, metropolitan, creative class'' customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you think about Virgin and travel and lifestyle and what we do -- hotels isn't a stretch; it's a natural fit,'' says Anthony Marino, managing partner of the <span class="companylink">Virgin Group</span>'s leisure and hospitality sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Branson had been considering such an expansion for more than two years, just waiting for the right time to jump in, Mr. Marino says. The company will probably buy, rather than build, hotels and convert them to the Virgin brand, he says, with the first location slated to open in 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a lot of volatility in real estate, and these gateway cities are hard to penetrate -- and this might be an opportunity to really get into these markets,'' he says. ''You take advantage of volatility and make it an opportunity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, luxury hotels in major metro markets like New York, San Francisco and Boston seem to offer the biggest windfalls, analysts say. They took the hardest hit during the recession, and investors hope they'll bounce back just as steeply. Valuations for luxury hotels plunged 30 percent in 2008 and 45 percent in 2009, according to Mr. Woodworth, as profits slid 7.3 percent and 47.5 percent respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But high-end hoteliers weren't suffering alone. Across the country and at every price point, the industry has been slammed since the economy's downturn in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue per available room, known in the industry as revpar, plunged 17 percent in 2009, according to <span class="companylink">Smith Travel Research</span>, the biggest annual decline since the firm began tracking the data in 1987.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colliers, the research firm, expects revpar to climb 5.9 percent in 2011 and 10.6 percent in 2012, and rates to rise 3.8 percent in 2011 and 6.3 percent in 2012. ''There are many investors looking to play the recovery,'' says David Loeb, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Robert W. Baird &amp; Company</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WALTER ISENBERG, president and chief executive of Sage Hospitality, a hotel development and management company, says he's seen a surge in the number of REITs acquiring hotel properties in major American markets. ''The general feeling is, those markets have recovered faster than the suburban markets,'' he says, ''and the buyers believe there will be a sustained recovery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Isenberg expects the most distressed assets -- and potentially the most profitable deals -- to come in 2011 and 2012 when large, highly leveraged loans come due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial public offerings are likely to escalate as well, analysts say; Mr. Hanson says he expects lodging I.P.O.'s to approach record levels in late 2011 or early 2012. The success of Hyatt's I.P.O. last year -- at the peak of the recession -- may encourage a number of private equity firms to use public offerings as exit strategies, especially for larger companies, like Hilton and Four Seasons Hotels, that were taken private before the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackstone acquired Hilton in a $26 billion deal at the height of the real estate bubble in 2007 and has since been forced to renegotiate the terms of its debt, like many of its peers in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackstone financed the leveraged buyout with only $5.7 billion in Blackstone equity and $20.6 billion in mortgage and mezzanine debt, or junior debt that has a higher risk of being unpaid. Various banks, including <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, hold pieces of the debt. Even the Federal Reserve holds a $4 billion chunk of Hilton debt, which it inherited as it facilitated the sale of <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> to <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the deal was initially seen as a touchdown for Blackstone, the applause died down as the hotel sector imploded, causing property values to tumble and the debt markets to freeze up. At one point, Blackstone wrote down the value of its investment by more than 60 percent, a paper loss of more than $3.5 billion. And because the debt markets had all but frozen, the banks were unable to sell the loans to investors. As a result, Blackstone had to renegotiate the loan terms with lenders to keep its investment afloat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the firm succeeded in hammering out a restructuring agreement, in which it put up $800 million in additional equity in a deal that cut its $20 billion debt load by about $4 billion. (The deal involved buying back $1.8 billion in mezzanine debt, converting $2.1 billion of other debt to preferred equity and extending other loan maturities to 2015.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hilton is a great company with an almost boundless future,'' says Peter Rose, a spokesman for Blackstone. ''Its debt restructuring was an important step in its continued growth and expansion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry experts gave Blackstone a proverbial pat on the back for being able to complete such a large restructuring when the economy was still shaky. Many saw the transaction as a sign that the sector was thawing out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a further sign of a rebound, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> recently began unloading its share of the debt through a commercial mortgage bond offering -- something it had not been able to do since the market collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotel stocks have been rallying in anticipation of the industry's recovery. Hotel REITs posted total returns, including dividends, of 67 percent in 2009 and are up a further 35 percent so far in 2010, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. Some of the biggest gainers have been Strategic Hotels and Resorts, <span class="companylink">Ashford Hospitality Trust</span> and <span class="companylink">Hersha Hospitality Trust</span>, whose year-to-date returns, through Thursday, including dividends, are 163 percent, 119 percent and 109 percent, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, as Mr. Kelley, the <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> analyst, said in a research note, lodging REITs and companies are still trading 21 percent below their peak values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INVESTORS may have to wait for the big paybacks, Mr. Mandigo said, noting that after the 2002 downturn, it took four years for hotel rates to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers have evidently not daunted Mr. Branson and others who are jumping into the industry. Mr. Butler of Jeffer Mangels sees great opportunity for them, along with great risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would never bet against Mr. Branson, but it will, at the very least, be challenging,'' Mr. Butler says. ''He certainly has some terrific name recognition from his other ventures, but it takes years to build and establish a brand and a place in the market. He may well do it, but I think it's gutsy.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the biggest real estate deal of the year, <span class="companylink">Google</span> signed a contract on Thursday to buy one of the largest office buildings in Manhattan for more than $1.8 billion, according to two real estate executives who have been briefed on the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> put down a ''substantial deposit'' on the 15-story building at 111 Eighth Avenue, just north of the meatpacking district, and is expected to close the sale by the end of the year, said the executives, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contract not only signals a rebounding real estate market, at least for office buildings full of high-profile tenants paying good rents, but also reflects a vote of confidence by an expanding technology firm in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This decision is further evidence that large-scale buildings are trading once again,'' said Ross Moskowitz, a real estate lawyer at <span class="companylink">Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan</span> and a former city economic development official, ''and high-end users are looking to take advantage of these opportunities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brick building, which covers an entire block bound by 15th and 16th Streets, already houses <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s East Coast headquarters and 1,800 employees, as well as Lifetime Entertainment, barnesandnoble.com, Nike USA and Deutsch advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at 2.9 million square feet, it has more space than the Empire State Building and plenty of room for <span class="companylink">Google</span> to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current owners -- the <span class="companylink">New York State Common Retirement Fund</span>; Jamestown, a German investment group; and <span class="companylink">Taconic Investment Partners</span> -- put the building on the auction block in September, hoping to attract foreign investors, private equity firms and other companies scouring the market for investment opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Harmon, the broker who handled the sale, snared a dozen bidders. But <span class="companylink">Google</span> moved quickly to pre-empt other potential buyers and entered exclusive negotiations with the owners. On Thursday, both sides signed the contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the sturdy brick building, which has 15-foot ceilings and unobstructed views, and the neighborhood have undergone a remarkable transformation. The structure was built by the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span> in 1932 for port-related businesses. Taconic and its partners bought the property in 1998 and began stocking the building with telecom companies like Verizon and Sprint and later Deutsch advertising. Taconic is expected to continue managing the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As meatpackers moved out of the neighborhood to the south they were replaced by galleries, fashion houses and expensive shops.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Pending Home Sales Rose 10.4% In October</span>
</div><div class="author">By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS    </div><div>441 words</div><div>3 December 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.    </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people who signed contracts to buy homes rose in October, the third gain since contract signings hit a decade low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that its index of sales agreements for previously occupied homes rose 10.4 percent in October. Contract signings were up in every region of the country except the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected contract signings to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the October gain, contract signings are 18.3 percent above June's index, which was at the lowest level since the private group began tracking signed contracts in 2001. Still, they remain 20.5 percent below the October 2009 level, the highest point since May 2006, before the housing market collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, potential buyers were rushing to close deals to take advantage of a federal home-buying tax credit that initially was to expire in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist, said that even with the rebound in contract signings in October, housing was being held back by a number of factors from high unemployment to tighter standards on home mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A return to more normal loan underwriting standards and removal of unnecessary underwriting fees for very-low-risk borrowers is needed and could quickly help,'' Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, a foreclosure listing firm said that the worst summer for home sales in decades had dampened foreclosure sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RealtyTrac said foreclosure sales had dropped 25 percent in the July-September quarter versus activity in the April-June period, even as the average discount on distressed properties had increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report on contract signings from the Realtors showed that signings were up 19.6 percent in the Northeast, 27.3 percent in the Midwest and 7.1 percent in the South. However, signings dropped 0.4 percent in the West region in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a job-related report, the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment aid rose last week by a seasonally adjusted 26,000, to 436,000. The previous week's claims were revised up slightly to show applications had tumbled by 31,000, to 410,000. The figures are often volatile during the weeks around the Veterans Day and Thanksgiving holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the longer-term trend has shown a downward drift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes volatility, fell to 431,000 last week, a two-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report also showed that the number of people continuing to collect unemployment aid rose to 4.3 million for the week ending Nov. 20.</p>

</div><div class="author">By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   </div><div>626 words</div><div>1 December 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in home prices is accelerating across the nation, according to a new report, and a record number of foreclosures is expected to push prices down further through next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a second report released on Tuesday indicated that consumer confidence in the economy rose in November to the highest level in five months amid some more hopeful signs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller 20-city home price index released Tuesday fell 0.7 percent in September from August. Eighteen of the 20 cities recorded price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cleveland recorded the biggest drop, 3 percent from a month earlier. Prices in San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, which had been showing strength this year, also dropped in September from August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington and Las Vegas were the only metro areas to post gains in monthly prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-city index has risen 5.9 percent from its April 2009 bottom. But it remains nearly 28.6 percent below the peak, in July 2006. And home prices have fallen in 15 of the 20 cities in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose in many cities from April through July, mostly helped by government tax credits that have since expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national quarterly index, which measures home prices in nine regions of the country, dropped 2 percent in the third quarter from the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the other report, the Conference Board said that its Consumer Confidence Index for November rose to 54.1 points, up from a revised 49.9 in October. Analysts were expecting 52.0. November's reading is the highest since June's 54.3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The November reading is the highest since June, when the index stood at 54.3 just as the economy's recovery started to lose momentum. Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected 52.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It takes a level of 90 to indicate a healthy economy, which has not been approached since the recession began in December 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One component of the index, how Americans feel now about the economy, rose to 24, up from 23.5. The other gauge, which measures how American feel about the economy over the next six months, rose to 74.2, up from 67.5 last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Consumer confidence is now at its highest level in five months, a welcome sign as we enter the holiday season,'' Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center, said in a statement. ''Consumers' assessment of the current state of the economy and job market, while only slightly better than last month, suggests the economy is still expanding, albeit slowly. Hopefully, the improvement in consumers' mood will continue in the months ahead.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others were less optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The rise in consumer confidence in November is not consistent with a sustained acceleration in consumption growth at a time when income growth is weak, the unemployment rate is high and a double dip in house prices is under way,'' said Paul Dales, United States economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer confidence index, which measures how respondents feel about business conditions, the job market and the economy over the next six months, has recovered fitfully since hitting a record low of 25.3 in February 2009. Economists watch confidence closely because consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity and is crucial to a strong rebound. The improved confidence mirrors an increase in spending in November, fueled by early discounting on holiday goods that lured shoppers into stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board's index, based on a random survey mailed to 5,000 households from Nov. 1 to Nov. 19, showed that worries about jobs eased, but that concern remained high.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Edgewater Medical Center closed nearly 10 years ago, the abandoned building and the surrounding 114,300-square-foot lot at 5700 North Ashland Avenue have deteriorated into a state of dangerous, not to mention unsightly, disrepair. Wind-blown litter dances over the grounds like tumbleweeds, and gang tags adorn the hospital's walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site is a blight on the neighborhood -- on that point, at least, there is consensus among neighborhood groups and area politicians. But what, exactly, should replace it? A much-needed park, a mixed-use development, combining condos and commercial space, or, in the spirit of compromise, perhaps a little of each?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where consensus ends, and where a classically Chicago narrative emerges. Rooted in the perennial allure of tax increment financing -- a tool in which the city siphons all growth in tax revenues into special accounts to use for economic development -- the story pits political and commercial interests and quality-of-life concerns against grim financial realities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the 2008 financial collapse, when real estate was booming, commercial and residential development in the city ran into fewer roadblocks as property values rose and residents had more disposable income. Now, with foreclosures still weighing on home prices, the expectations of residents throughout Chicago are shifting, as sharply illustrated by the Edgewater dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several community groups argue that the site should be transformed into a park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Donovan, a Chicago business owner and spokesman for Friends of West Edgewater Park, has been a vocal advocate for creating green space, which he said would greatly improve the area for residents, who have no parks within easy walking distance. A park, Mr. Donovan said, would also prevent the construction of condominiums that would ''overload an already oversaturated residential real estate market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edgewater is the city's second-densest neighborhood in population, according to United States census data. Chris Swan, a chief executive of an executive recruitment firm and vice president of West Edgewater Area Residents, or W.E.A.R., said he worried about the lack of momentum on the park proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What scares me,'' Mr. Swan said, ''is that the city is going to get tired of looking at this thing and tear it down, and then just give the developers the permits to build whatever they want. And who's going to benefit from this? Not the community, that's for sure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Mr. Donovan and Mr. Swan are critical of Alderman Patrick O'Connor (40th Ward) for what they say is his inaction on the issue. Mr. O'Connor said he had no objection to a park, but did not know who was going to pay for it. The city would have to buy the property, and according to a private estimate filed to the city by Appraisal Associates, the land under the medical center is worth $5.3 million, not including the demolition costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Connor, who is running for re-election in 2011, and members of W.E.A.R. have asked Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, and State Senator Heather Steans, a Chicago Democrat, to look for money in their budgets that could be used for the park. Representatives for both politicians have indicated interest, but no concrete commitments have been made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Donovan and Mr. Swan said they believed the necessary money was available in the Edgewater/Ashland Tax Increment Financing District fund, which is projected at $3.9 million. ''I live in one of the houses that pays into the TIF,'' Mr. Donovan said. ''It was on my tax bill recently.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the 2009 spending report, the TIF district spends about $4,000 annually, generally on small budget items like development reports and surveys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a meeting with Edgewater community groups in October, Mr. O'Connor was asked about spending TIF money for a park. According to Mr. Donovan, Mr. O'Connor said that $400,000 had been spent from the fund, but that he did not indicate what it went for. Mr. Donovan said he wrote to the alderman's office asking for a record of that spending, but got no response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked last week about those expenditures, Mr. O'Connor said: ''That might be the total amount of funding we've expended on local improvements, things like sidewalks and lighting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that TIF money must be earmarked for future use -- otherwise it expires -- and that might explain the fate of some of the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're trying to get some people to understand this is not a situation where you can say, O.K., here's the check,'' Mr. O'Connor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is partly because there is no single owner. The Edgewater Medical Center is owned by the Edgewater Medical Center Bankruptcy Estate, which is made up of more than 250 creditors -- individuals as well as business entities, including the French-Belgian bank <span class="companylink">Dexia</span>. According to Scott Mendeloff, a lawyer at the Howrey firm who represents the bankruptcy estate, creditors are owed in excess of $110 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if its ownership were clear, Mr. O'Connor said, there is still the issue of cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got maybe $3 million,'' he said. ''That's a long way from $20 to $30 you'd need'' to make this park a reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Connor emphasized that he did not oppose a park in theory. ''It's not at all a dead issue,'' he said. ''I mean, who doesn't want a park? It's silly that there are people in the neighborhood who think we want to build something else other than a park. The real question is, can we afford it?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A park may not be feasible, Mr. O'Connor said, especially if tax-producing development on the site is taken off the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The amount in the TIF fund is based on assumptions that the hospital site would be developed and generate income,'' he said. ''Building a park, you're not going to generate income.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could affect the amount of money available for future TIF projects, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Swan said that was not true. ''That money is coming from the houses that are already there,'' he said. A park would ''exponentially'' increase surrounding property values, generate greater tax revenue and benefit the TIF district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Donovan said he would like to see the new park built as a public-private partnership, in the mold of Millennium Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The W.E.A.R. board is expected to meet Tuesday. The park issue is likely to come up, Mr. Donovan said, but no one expects a quick resolution. District voters will have their say about the park via a nonbinding initiative on the February 2011 ballot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More immediately, Mr. Donovan said, ''I'd like to see the alderman answer our letter about the TIF funds that have been spent in our district. I'd like him to agree to allocate this TIF toward the purchase and demolition of the facility, to lay the groundwork for a park or green space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Connor counseled patience -- and pragmatism. ''Some of the folks involved are basically saying, 'I want a park and I don't care how it happens,' '' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Swan said he was willing to wait for the outcome he wanted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been living with this thing for nine years,'' he said. ''Personally, I'd rather have the empty building than a big development. We need to reclaim this property for the community benefit.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVEN though the market remains troubled and financing is as elusive for projects as for individual mortgages, at least two residential developers in Westchester are forging ahead, despite the compromises being forced on them by the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Port Chester, Frank Boccanfuso, the managing partner of FMB Asset Management and Phoenix Capital Partners, has broken ground on two luxury projects on sites near the Byram River. And in Yonkers, Fleet Mill Street -- an offshoot of SFC, the company planning the massive redevelopment of the Yonkers downtown -- will rehabilitate a vacant building in the densely populated Getty Square area near the Hudson River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In both instances one basic compromise has involved relying on either their own sources of capital or government grants to get their projects under way. Another has required giving up on the idea of selling units in favor of rentals -- since that sector of the housing market, according to property management groups, continues to be strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone's nervous these days when it comes to the for-sale market,'' said Terry Danner, the president of <span class="companylink">Riverstone Residential Group</span> of Dallas, a property management advisory group that manages 650 complexes throughout the country. ''We're seeing lots of companies not willing or able to sit with empty units,'' Mr. Danner added, ''so they're running with rentals for now with the possibility of converting to for-sale units at a future date.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boccanfuso is using his own capital for the $40 million Port Chester project. He acquired the land several years ago with the idea of building condominiums, ''but the market changed,'' he said. ''Last year I didn't plan anything at all because there was just too much uncertainty in the market. This year it seems safe to move ahead but with a different approach than I had in mind at first.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fleet Mill Street's project in Yonkers will repurpose a three-story structure that had been the home of the Yonkers Public Library, and before that, in the early part of the 20th century, a popular department store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new mixed-use plan calls for up to 16 live-work rental lofts on the two upper floors and 8,000 square feet of retail space at street level. Fleet Mill Street is seeking to attract young professionals like accountants and architects to the studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments, which it plans to rent for as much as $1,700 per month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For so long we were focusing only on the big projects, the grand-slam home runs like our Trump buildings and the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span>,'' said Joseph V. Apicella, a senior vice president of Cappelli Enterprises in Valhalla, which is a partner in SFC with Fidelco Realty Group of Millburn, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the recession, Cappelli Enterprises built two Trump residential towers with for-sale units, one in White Plains and another in New Rochelle. The firm changed the face of White Plains with the construction of several residential and retail buildings, and of New Rochelle with New Roc City, a $190 million entertainment center, hotel and apartment complex. But it has put most of its coming projects on hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This project isn't a home run in terms of what we've done in the past,'' Mr. Apicella said of the Yonkers library conversion, ''but it's definitely a single or double, and in this economy that's pretty good.'' Not only is it difficult for buyers to obtain mortgages, he said, but also ''it's extremely difficult for developers like us to obtain financing for large-scale projects.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toward that end, the Yonkers Community Development Agency has designated the Fleet Mill Street group as a qualified developer for the reconstruction project, which makes it eligible for a $5.4 million Restore New York grant from the Empire State Development Corporation -- a program to help old cities rebuild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philip A. Amicone, the mayor, said he saw the library project as a good interim step for Yonkers, given that the more ambitious ones planned earlier cannot be taken in this environment. ''It's still a bad market out there,'' Mr. Amicone said. But he said that it is an ''encouraging sign'' that smaller projects like this are being pursued while the city waits for SFC to move ahead with its larger projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two sites that Mr. Boccanfuso acquired in Port Chester, each 1.5 acres in size, required differing levels of preparation before his rental projects could proceed. One site directly on the Byram River waterfront used to be a brownfield; he bought it for $5.5 million and spent an additional $2 million to remove industrial fill, metals and petroleum. The building under construction on the site, called the Mariner, will have 100 rental units and 25 boat slips. The one- and two-bedroom apartments will rent from $1,800 to $2,900 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boccanfuso paid $6 million to acquire the other site and has just finished demolition of the vacant buildings there. The 83 one- and two-bedroom units he plans at the Castle, as he is calling the brick and stone luxury development, will rent from $1,600 to $2,600 a month. He said he thought units would rent quickly because few if any other rental properties are coming on line now in the Greenwich-Rye-Purchase market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boccanfuso said he had watched the market weather ups and downs since starting FMB Real Estate Services as a corporate real estate consulting and brokerage company in 1990, and Phoenix Capital Partners for investments in 1999. There are often a few areas of demand that a developer can capitalize on even in hard times, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My research and experience indicates that there is a market now for urban pockets of relatively affordable new construction outside the city that are also near transportation and shopping,'' he said. ''The added bonus is that my units are also near a body of water.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATLANTA -- As real estate deals go, the sale of Ann's Snack Bar may be a true test of the value of cult food in a bad economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, just how much is a Ghetto Burger worth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 38 years of serving her messy, hand-pressed burgers to an endless parade of restaurant critics, celebrities like Sean Combs and, lately, a horde of Twitter-driven food enthusiasts, Ann Price decided it was time to put down her spatula and get a little return on her investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She thought about all those years of work and her growing national reputation and set the price at $1.5 million in August 2009. After all, one national food critic even said she made the best burger in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People come here from all over the world, people from every race,'' said Ms. Price, 67, who personally makes every burger. ''Everybody wants to know: what is a Ghetto Burger?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, a bad real estate market is a bad real estate market, even for a restaurant so popular that people will wait outside for hours to snag one of the eight stools. Now, she will let the shop go for $450,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cheeseburger that put her on the map is constructed from two big patties of generic ground beef, fried with big pieces of onion and seasoned with something she won't tell you about unless you buy the place. She lightens it up with bacon, a little chili sauce and lettuce and tomato. It costs $9.50 with fries, and she has lawyers working on trademarking the name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although one might argue that many of the hundreds of hamburgers made by chefs in this burger-crazy nation are better, it is hard to argue that hers has less cachet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anna Monzon, 30, an Atlanta resident who works for a West Coast skateboard company, was the first in the door one recent day. She ordered five to take with her to Los Angeles. Her brother, such a food fanatic that he follows 20 food carts on Twitter, told her not to board the plane without them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not a big burger person,'' Ms. Monzon said, ''but this is the one burger I'd wait a couple hours in line for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That does not translate into a big real estate deal, though -- especially in a city where 14 percent of retail property is vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The way the real estate market is selling, there was no way we could make that sale in the next couple years,'' said Willie J. Burks, the agent who originally put the property up for $1.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, people who know Ms. Price and know what she has brought to the neighborhood believe she should not sell herself short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The brand alone and the nature of the culture here makes a million about right,'' said James McCauly, 25, who drove in with his uncle from a suburb north of Atlanta when they heard the place was going to be sold. ''Anybody who is anybody in Atlanta knows about this place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, why did she call it a Ghetto Burger? A customer first suggested it, as a kind of joke. But a fast food restaurant had just opened down the block, and the neighborhood was really in the economic dumps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Ms. Price doubled down on ingredients, creating a beefier patty and adding some extra toppings. She sold it for $4. For a little variety, she swapped coleslaw for lettuce and tomato and called that one the Hood Burger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had to do something to get people's attention,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much has changed in the Kirkwood neighborhood in east Atlanta since Ms. Price -- known as ''Miss Ann'' to fans -- bought the tiny shop in 1972. Upscale houses and a golf course opened up the street. And clients now include people like Atlanta politicians and the actor Robert Duvall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This isn't really the ghetto anymore,'' said John Byrd, 70, a retired repairman who has been getting to-go burgers there for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shop remained a local secret until 1998, when The Atlanta Constitution featured her in an article. The next morning, she said, she had about 15 pounds of ground beef from the grocery down the street and a line waiting for her to open. Ms. Price was so panicked by the crowd that she almost did not open. A friend had to track down more ground beef, but even that was not enough. She was off to the races.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With success has come confidence. A little too much, maybe. Posted rules include no cursing. A patron may come in to eat only when one of the eight stools opens up. Couples who show up when only one stool is left are forced to split up and eat one at a time. And the smart customer knows not to ask questions when the little grill is filled with meat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Price, the fourth child of a Georgia farm family, has never married. She cooks eight hours a day, six days a week. She has a list of health problems, although she hauls bags of ice and 50 pounds of burger into her shop every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She wants to retire so she can take a nap. She wants to remodel her house and garden and sit on one of the white rockers on her front porch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just hope somebody gives me a good price,'' she said, ''so I can get up out of here.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">A New Push to Rescue The Xanadu Mall Project</span>
</div><div class="author">By CHARLES V. BAGLI   </div><div>1104 words</div><div>27 November 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders and state officials in New Jersey are desperately trying to cobble together the second rescue of Xanadu, one of the nation's largest, most expensive and still incomplete retail and entertainment malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2.4-million-square-foot project, which began in 2003 with futuristic visions of an indoor ski slope, a super-size Ferris wheel, a concert hall, movie theaters, bowling alleys, restaurants and expensive shops, ran through two owners and a staggering $1.9 billion before work came to a halt nearly two years ago amid the financial crisis and the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lenders are now hoping to strike a deal by the end of 2010 with a new developer and a new financial partner willing to put up more than $500 million to finish the five-story mall in the Meadowlands, six miles from Times Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been working closely with the bank group in an effort to have a mutual accord on a new developer for the project,'' said Jon F. Hanson, a top adviser to Gov. Chris Christie. ''We are hopeful that, shortly, we can all agree as to who that developer will be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference this time is that the governor, who has made cost-cutting a hallmark of his administration, is willing to provide some low-interest financing and forgo sales tax revenues for a time, according to officials and executives involved in the talks. The plan is to resume work immediately so that the complex can open sometime in the second half of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the resuscitation of the project faces daunting economic and strategic obstacles, according to retail experts and developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an awfully deep hole they have to dig out of,'' said James Sullivan, a retailing specialist at Green Street Advisors, a real estate research firm. ''It doesn't mean it can't be done. But which retailers will step up and be part of the solution remains to be seen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already more than three years behind schedule, Xanadu has to overcome a troubled reputation, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xanadu, which once had a million square feet of leases with a variety of retailers, including <span class="companylink">Cabela's</span>, the outdoor sports and clothing chain, must start over, luring tenants at a time when retailers are hesitant to spend cash on opening new shops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retail environment is particularly challenging. In nearby Yonkers, Forest City Ratner has leased only 35 percent of its 1.2-million-square-foot retail and entertainment complex at Ridge Hill, while another developer, O'Neil Properties Group, is marketing its recreation and retail project 30 minutes south of Manhattan in Sayreville, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing also remains expensive and hard to come by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And to further complicate matters, Xanadu, which blends retailing with entertainment, must comply with regulations unheard of at most malls, like local blue laws, which prohibit retail sales on Sundays, and restrictions on mall activity imposed by their next-door neighbor, the Giants football team, on game days during the football season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's kind of a chicken-and-egg thing,'' said Richard Brunelli, president of R. J. Brunelli, a retail consultant. ''Until they get a credible developer known to have the financial resources to complete it, I don't know how they'll get tenants to pay attention. And they probably need to get it pre-leased to get the financing wrapped up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents say that Xanadu still has undeniable strengths, including its location at the center of a vast network of highways and its proximity to high-income communities and tourist-rich Manhattan. And Mr. Hanson, a real estate investor himself, is confident that Xanadu can be completed and successful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority picked the Mills Corporation to build the Xanadu complex in 2003 on 104 acres in the Meadowlands Sports Complex, which includes an arena, a stadium and a racetrack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 2006, with Mills in financial trouble and cost overruns plaguing Xanadu, a partnership led by Colony Capital, a private equity firm based in Los Angeles, took over the project, without changing the original concept. But early in 2009, Colony and its partners ran into their own problems when a subsidiary of the bankrupt <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> cut off the promised construction financing for Xanadu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early this year, Colony began talks with Stephen M. Ross, chief executive of Related Companies, to bring in fresh capital to finish the project. Mr. Ross, whose company built the $1.7 billion <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center at Columbus Circle, went trolling for tenants at a trade show in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Ross was unable to reach a final agreement, so in August the senior lenders for the project, who had invested $500 million, foreclosed, essentially wiping out the $1.4 billion put into Xanadu by Mills and Colony, Dune Capital and Kan Am.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the lenders and their advisers, <span class="companylink">Moelis &amp; Company</span> and <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, have talked to a variety of possible partners, including the <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span> group, which owns the Mall of America in Minnesota and the West Edmonton Mall in Canada, two of the largest in the world; <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties</span>; and <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are pleased with the level of interest we have received from prospective developers, and hope to name a new developer for the project shortly,'' said Michael Beckerman, a spokesman for the lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new partners would have to put up $600 million to $800 million, according to executives involved in the talks. But they would be the first to reap any potential profits, because the lenders' $500 million would be subordinate to the new investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the Christie administration is likely to provide about $180 million in low-interest bonds, which would be repaid by diverting 75 percent of the projected sales tax revenues from Xanadu. Although the state's advisers once described Xanadu as a ''failed business model,'' they have since softened their stance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Christie administration is eager to see Xanadu restarted, especially since the adjacent racetrack loses money, the Izod arena is without a tenant and the newly built stadium for the Jets and the Giants pays less in rent and fees than the old stadium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Brunelli, the retail adviser, said that he would surprised to see Governor Christie ''put taxpayer money into this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would fly in the face of what he's been preaching,'' he added. ''Nor do I believe taxpayers should put money into the project. The market should determine whether the project goes forward, not politicians.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By KRISTINA SHEVORY </div><div>1085 words</div><div>24 November 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the start of the year, David Neithercut, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, a real estate investment trust, set a target of $1 billion to spend on apartment buildings across the country. By the middle of this month, after buying 15 properties that included a troubled condominium tower in San Diego and three apartment buildings in Manhattan, Mr. Neithercut had invested $1.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We stepped up, swallowed hard and plunged in,'' said Mr. Neithercut, whose <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> is the country's biggest publicly traded REIT. ''We never expected there to be a lot of opportunities out there in the marketplace.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, the top apartment buyer this year, according to the research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, joins a list of institutional, public and private investors that are plowing money into apartments at a time when the market for most commercial real estate is flat. In the third quarter, sales of apartment buildings jumped 63 percent over the previous quarter, to $8.5 billion, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. Sales this year through the third quarter now stand at $18.5 billion, nearly double the same period last year. By comparison, sales through the third quarter in 2006 were $659.6 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of factors are behind the rise in multifamily-unit sales this year. Low interest rates, a lack of new construction and falling vacancy rates have swelled the ranks of buyers and, in some cases, incited bidding wars. And real estate investors are eager to spend cash reserves hoarded in the bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Investors see this as a great opportunity to get their hands on assets of the highest quality,'' said Hessam Nadji, the managing director of research and advisory services at Marcus &amp; Millichap, a real estate services firm in Encino, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition is strong for the few properties that reach the market. Many owners are loath to sell unless they can reap a large profit. Class A properties, or properties in good locations, selling for more than $20 million in cities with little development and strong demand are the most wanted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's highly competitive today because we only have 10 percent of the inventory we had in 2006,'' said Mark T. Alfieri, an executive vice president at Behringer Harvard, a private commercial real estate firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some real estate investors bought properties last year, the buying did not begin in earnest until after the first quarter. Even <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, which was sitting on $1 billion in cash at the start of last year, bought only two properties in 2009. Rental rates and occupancies had improved enough by the second quarter that many real estate investment trusts were able to raise enough money to return to the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, Equity's big recent purchases have included the 38-story River Tower at 420 East 54th Street, the 32-story 777 Sixth Avenue and the 26-story Longacre House at 305 West 50th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate companies with new multifamily investment funds that do not have any properties underwater or carrying heavy debt loads have moved the swiftest. Last year, Behringer Harvard became the year's most active buyer after purchasing 14 apartment buildings, many in all-cash deals, for $765 million. This year the company, based outside Dallas, has already spent $740.6 million on multifamily properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CB Richard Ellis Investors, which started a multifamily arm two years ago, has spent almost $1 billion since April 2009 on apartment buildings in deals that are either all-cash or combine low debt with cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We may not be the highest bidder, but we have the highest probability of closing,'' said Stephen Zaleski, the managing director of the Multihousing Group at CB Richard Ellis Investors in Boston. ''We're incredibly nimble and can close a deal in 30 days.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have grown more confident about the market and are paying higher prices for a promise of future growth. As prices have escalated, capitalization rates, or the initial return on a building, have dropped to 6.7 percent in the third quarter nationwide. (When capitalization rates fall, so do investors' returns.) The rates had been as high as 7.1 percent in 2009. But in some big markets, cap rates, as they are called, have plunged to 4.5 to 5 percent. Since he started buying last year, Mr. Neithercut said, prices have risen 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd like to back up a truck and buy more back then,'' Mr. Neithercut said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it may seem counterintuitive in a slow-growing economy, real estate investors are willing to accept lower yields on the prospect of higher rents to come. Many say they think cap rates have bottomed and will start to rise in the coming year as fewer new apartments come on the market and demand for apartments heats up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new multifamily properties that are opening now were started before the credit crunch, when renter demand was high and financing was easier to get. This year, 99,000 units are expected to open, 40,000 fewer than in 2009. Just 50,000 apartments are projected for next year. It will probably be the end of 2012 before a large number of new properties open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A smaller inventory should help drive vacancy rates even lower. A drop in vacancies nationwide and an increase in rents have emboldened investors. In the third quarter, the national vacancy rate dropped to 7.1 percent from 7.8 percent, the real estate research firm Reis said, the lowest number since Reis started publishing quarterly figures in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While job growth has remained anemic -- though the figures from October were encouraging -- real estate experts and investors say more Americans who had moved in with friends and family are gaining confidence in their job prospects and are signing leases again. Buying a home is less a consideration than renting for many people because they have neither money nor confidence in their job prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are more willing to take a risk and lease an apartment because they expect to find a job in the next six to nine months,'' said Victor Calanog, the director of research for Reis in New York.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last few years, buyers have been lured into the troubled housing market by two unusual opportunities: cash subsidies in the form of government tax credits, and rock-bottom prices on millions of foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credits are now history. And the supply of foreclosed homes on the market is already falling as regulators, lawmakers and state law enforcement officials press to sharply reduce the number of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, buyers and sellers are getting an early taste of what the real estate market might look like without those twin pillars of support: sales of existing homes plunged 26 percent in October compared with the same period last year, the National Association of Realtors said in a report Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some parts of the country, it was the worst October in at least 20 years, according to separate regional sales reports. Sales were down 41 percent in Minneapolis, 28 percent in Massachusetts and 34 percent in Illinois.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Portland, Ore., (down 39 percent) and Seattle (down 32 percent), it was the worst October since record-keeping began in 1994. In California, it was the second-worst October since at least 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People aren't buying houses -- period,'' said Mark Fleming, an economist with <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a data firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts had been predicting that winter chills would arrive early, although the numbers turned out to be a little worse than they had anticipated. Last fall, sales were robust as buyers scrambled to take advantage of the government's $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, which was on the verge of ending. (Tax credits were later extended and expanded to include a broader range of buyers, expiring finally in April.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The factors that brought people into the market have either disappeared, in the case of the tax credit, or their impact is lessening, in the case of foreclosures,'' said Jennifer H. Lee of BMO Capital Markets. ''I would certainly hope that housing can stand on its own two feet, but it will depend largely on the job market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 4.43 million homes were sold on a seasonally adjusted annual basis in October, compared with nearly 6 million in October 2009. In October 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, about 5 million deals were signed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the first month without the credit, sales hit a nadir of 3.84 million, the lowest level in 14 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit inspired many people to accelerate planned purchases, just as administration economists intended. Meanwhile, the abundance of foreclosures offered millions of first-time buyers a chance to become owners. Misfortune for some yielded opportunities for others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed sales, including foreclosures, have been about a third of the market, while first-time buyers have been as much as 50 percent. Both are high by historic levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the supply of previously foreclosed homes continues to dry up, housing prices might stabilize or even rise. That would provide long-sought relief for sellers but it could keep many potential buyers out of the market and put sales in a permanent slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill and Becky Britt just bought a house with five bedrooms, five baths and a five-car garage in the Denver suburb of Evergreen. The property was listed three years ago for $1.25 million. As recently as last February, the seller was trying to get $800,000. Then the property went into foreclosure. It was offered this fall by a bank for $600,000. The Britts paid $550,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such deals are disappearing, said the couple's agent, Marlene Maxon. ''More and more the banks are figuring out, let's get these sold without having to go through foreclosure,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales, where the sellers negotiate with their lender to sell their house and repay less than the full amount owed, are rising in popularity although they are still outnumbered by foreclosures. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, for instance, said it had agreed to more than 60,000 short sales this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Evergreen house had been a short sale, priced at perhaps $650,000, the Britts would not be moving in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Frankly, we would not and could not have paid what we believe the house is truly worth,'' Mr. Britt, the president of Analytical Reference Materials International, wrote in an e-mail from Belgium, where he was working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures have been under fire for about two months now. All 50 state attorneys general are conducting a joint investigation whose goal is nothing less than to change foreclosure in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many earlier programs tried and failed to curb the number of foreclosures, the uproar and outrage over shoddy documentation procedures at some lenders make success much more likely. Further ammunition came Tuesday in a highly critical interim report by an interagency federal task force examining the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael S. Barr, assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions, told the Financial Stability Oversight Council that the task force found ''widespread, and in our judgment, inexcusable breakdowns in basic controls.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The task force, formed earlier this fall, is composed of representatives from a range of government agencies with an interest in the financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barr said the mission of the task force included ''providing alternatives to foreclosure, and acting in a coordinated and comprehensive way to hold the firms accountable, bring clarity and certainty and help households.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the banks under pressure, they de-emphasized foreclosures in October. According to Lender Processing Services, a data company, the number of foreclosed homes that the banks prepared for sale during the month dropped by a third, to 80,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether this drop-off is temporary depends on the extent to which loan modifications and short sales ultimately supplant foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the freezes, foreclosures were losing steam. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, for example, sales of previously foreclosed homes have fallen by a third over the last year, while traditional sales were largely stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The number of low-priced properties, of really good deals, is going to decline over the next few years,'' said Pat Paulson, president-elect of the Minneapolis Area Association of Realtors. ''And as foreclosures fall, prices will go up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, the sales of previously foreclosed houses dropped to 10,367 in October from 15,621 in October 2009 and 19,925 in October 2008, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a real estate information company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large part of the reason is that lenders simply are not bringing them to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, the data company, estimated this week that there was a ''shadow inventory'' of more than two million delinquent and foreclosed homes that banks will ultimately have to dispose of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some share of it surely will come to market,'' said Mr. Fleming, the <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> economist. ''How much is debatable.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHARLES V. BAGLI   </div><div>515 words</div><div>20 November 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disque D. Deane, a financier and real estate investor who at one time controlled the General Motors Building, shopping centers in New York, Massachusetts and Georgia, and the nation's largest federally subsidized housing complex, Starrett City in Brooklyn, died on Nov. 8 at his home in Boston. He was 89.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cause was pneumonia, his nephew, Curt Deane, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Deane, who had a reputation as a shrewd and combative investor, kept a stuffed white Alaskan timber wolf in his office as ''a reminder,'' he once said, ''that you should always keep your organization lean and hungry.'' A wolf also adorned the letterhead of his company, Corporate Property Investors, symbolizing both his lone wolf approach to investing and the dog-eat-dog world in which he operated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He was a very tough negotiator,'' Donald J. Trump, a partner in the Starrett City complex, said, ''but an amazing real estate mind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Deane may be best known for assembling a group of investors in 1972 to back the development of Starrett City, the largest publicly assisted rental complex in the nation, with 5,881 apartments in 46 buildings. The complex, which overlooks Jamaica Bay and has its own power plant, post office and stores, is regarded as a successful example of economically and racially diverse housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Deane's partnership, <span class="companylink">Starrett City Associates</span>, officially changed the name of the complex in 2002 to Spring Creek Towers, though it remained known as Starrett City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006 and 2007, at the top of the real estate market, Mr. Deane and his partners twice tried to sell the vast property, much to the chagrin of tenants, housing activists and many public officials who feared that long-term residents would be replaced by new tenants paying higher rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City, state and federal officials subsequently struck a deal to refinance the complex, enabling it to remain affordable to poor and working-class New Yorkers while the partners made an estimated $200 million profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disque Dee Deane was born on July 6, 1921. He grew up in New York City, attended Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan and Duke University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was a senior partner at the Lazard Freres investment bank, where he was active in corporate financing through real estate transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1971, Mr. Deane formed Corporate Property Investors, one of the largest real estate investment trusts of its time. The company built a number of shopping centers, including the Roosevelt Field mall on Long Island, the Burlington Mall in Burlington, Mass., and Lenox Square in Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through his philanthropy, he supported the Deane Laboratories in Neurobiology at Duke University and the Deane Institute for Integrated Research on Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Deane is survived by his wife, Carol, and their two children, Anne and Carl; five children from two prior marriages that ended in divorce, Hare Stuart, Marjorie Swain, Kathryn Deane, Disque Jr., and Walter; and several grandchildren.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHRISTINE HAUSER   </div><div>748 words</div><div>18 November 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>The New York Times on the Web</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices inched up in October, driven almost entirely by rising gasoline costs, according to government statistics released on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Department of Labor said the Consumer Price Indexrose 0.2 percent in October as energy costs rose, compared with a 0.1 percent rise in September. Analysts had forecast a rise of 0.3 percent for October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also put out new statistics on Wednesday, finding that new building of homes, or housing starts, fell in October to the lowest level in more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its report on prices, the Labor Department also reported a record. When excluding food and energy, the rise in core consumer prices in October was flat for the third consecutive month, and on an annual basis, core prices were up 0.6 percent, the smallest rise since the government started keeping the records in 1957.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists look at the monthly statistics closely to gauge the pace of rises or declines in prices. The exercise has taken on new impetus after the Federal Reserve began its quantitative easing program this month, injecting $600 billion into the economy by buying government securities to lower long-term interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed says the plan is to stimulate the economy, but it has encountered criticismthat it is setting the stage for future inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Greenhaus, the chief economic strategist with Miller Tabak &amp; Company, said that the October data show that price declines are the main concern, and that despite intervention, Fed policy makers ''have accomplished almost nothing in arresting the decline in prices throughout the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he added, the criticism that the Fed could be ''laying the groundwork'' for inflation ''may eventually be correct.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists for <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> said in a research note that the latest consumer price data showed ''broad-based disinflation'' among the index's components.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Today's report underscores the reasons why the F.O.M.C. has decided to do large-scale asset purchases, as year-to-year core consumer inflation hit an all-time low while housing activity continued to languish,'' the research note said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy makers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists have said the Fed was correct to take such measures as long as the country was dealing with high unemployment of 9.6 percent and as the housing market was still weak. The slow pace of sales, an uncertain job market, difficulties obtaining financing and a glut of existing homes have added to bleak prospects for the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said gasoline prices rose 4.6 percent in October and accounted for almost 90 percent of the overall consumer price increase. It was the fourth consecutive month that gasoline prices have risen. The food index rose slightly, up 0.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shelter and medical care costs also increased, but they were offset by declines in prices for a range of other items, including new vehicles, used cars and trucks, tobacco and clothing, the department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the housing front, the Commerce Department said new construction starts fell 11.7 percent to an annualized rate of 519,000 units, compared with a revised annual rate of 588,000 in September. The October pace was the weakest since April of last year, when the rate was 477,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Logan, the chief United States economist for <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>, noted that after federal tax subsidies for new home purchases ended six months ago, the pace of sales and starts has remained roughly unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing market continues to stagnate,'' Mr. Logan said. ''Low interest rates and quantitative easing have yet to give a significant boost to the housing sector,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another economist said the implications for the housing market were not as bad as the October numbers suggested, noting that new permits for building were a better gauge because they were less affected by seasons and better reflected the intentions and hopes of builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Newport, IHS Global Insight's United States economist, noted that permits rose 0.5 percent in October after declining the previous month to a 17-month low. Permits for single-family homes in particular rose 1 percent, the first increase in that category in seven months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Assuming credit markets continue to improve, the key for housing going forward is employment growth,'' Mr. Newport said in a statement. ''New jobs will require that new homes be built nearby.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By JULIE SATOW   </div><div>1317 words</div><div>17 November 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the technical school Katharine Gibbs shut its doors last year at 50 West 40th Street, it appeared to be another blow for the tiny Bryant Park office submarket. The blocks that bracket the 9.6-acre park were already facing the partial departure of <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>, a longtime anchor tenant; a largely vacant landmarked office tower; and the fire sale of a stalled development site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are bright spots: The City University of New York is awaiting final approvals for a 10-year lease to install its first new community college in more than 30 years at the 91,000-square-foot building that once housed Katharine Gibbs. The school is paying roughly $55 a square foot. And the new 55-story, 2.1-million-square-foot <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> tower opened this year at One Bryant Park, at 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bryant Park submarket -- from West 42nd Street to West 40th Street, from Fifth Avenue to Avenue of the Americas -- has certainly felt the reverberations of the real estate crash. <span class="companylink">HSBC Bank USA</span> sold its building at 452 Fifth Avenue at the corner of West 40th Street and plans to vacate 300,000 square feet of space in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farther west on 40th Street, the real estate investment firm Savanna bought the landmarked Springs Mills Building in August and is now trying to lease the 60 percent that is vacant. And at the site of a parking garage at 14-20 West 40th, the developer Ziel Feldman is hoping to resuscitate a hotel project that was a victim of the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CUNY's new community college is expected to open in 2012, according to Michael Arena, the university's director of communications and marketing. In the meantime, it will be used for administrative offices for the college and its School for Professional Studies. Eric Hadar, chairman of Allied Partners, the landlord of 50 West 40th Street, declined to comment on the CUNY lease, as did Howard J. Kesseler Jr., an executive managing director at Newmark Knight Frank, who represented CUNY.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bryant Park itself has had its share of difficulties. The park has been a burial ground, an encampment for the Union Army and a four-acre artificial lake. By the late 1970s it was plagued by drugs and crime, until a master revitalization plan was started. The park reopened in 1992 and established itself as the home to Fashion Week for nearly two decades, a luncheon spot for Midtown office workers and the site of seasonal outdoor movies and ice skating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The office market emerged in 2004 when the Durst Organization broke ground on the <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> skyscraper, designed by Cook &amp; Fox. <span class="companylink">Equity Office Properties Trust</span> followed that with a $250 million plan to reclad the former Verizon Building across 42nd Street at 1095 Avenue of the Americas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two towers anchored the neighborhood, said Craig L. Reicher, a vice chairman of <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>. ''Now the area is certainly considered its own market,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Grand Central to the east and Times Square to the west, Bryant Park ''is a tweener location,'' said Christopher Macke, a senior real estate strategist at the CoStar Group. ''It doesn't have the same cachet as the Plaza District, say, but if you are looking for good proximity to the trains and a little cheaper rent, it is an excellent choice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its apparent appeal, there have been some setbacks. In April, <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> completed a $330 million sale-leaseback of its headquarters building to a group of developers, including Midtown Holdings and <span class="companylink">Koor Industries</span>, which is based in Israel. Under the deal, the bank leased back floors one through 11 for 10 years, and floors 12 through 30 for one year. On April 30, <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>'s one year lease will expire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marketing for the 300,000 square feet of <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> offices began this month, said Mr. Reicher, who was handling the leasing. ''We have selectively taken some people through the space already,'' he said. The asking rents range from the high $60s a square foot to the high $80s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> building also has 24,000 square feet of retail, and a deal is near for a Staples office supply store to move in, said brokers familiar with the transaction who were not authorized to speak publicly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 21-story Springs Mills Building has about 150,000 square feet of vacancy. Savanna paid $61.7 million for the 210,000-square-foot building at 104 West 40th Street, including $46 million for a defaulted loan with a face value of $55 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to rent up the building relatively quickly,'' said Christopher Schlank, a managing partner of Savanna. ''We don't want to stick around for every last penny but would rather make good money and move on.'' The firm hopes to sell the building in three to five years, Mr. Schlank said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building has contiguous space available on floors two through 10 with a separate entrance on West 39th Street, as well as two 6,600-square-foot prebuilt spaces in the tower. In the hopes of attracting tenants, Savanna is asking rents from $48 a square foot to the mid-$60s. No average asking rents are available for the submarket, but average rents in the Avenue of the Americas/Rockefeller Center and Times Square South submarkets are $63.05 a square foot and $41.07 a square foot, respectively, according to <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 660,000 square feet is at risk of becoming vacant over the next several months in the Bryant Park vicinity, according to the CoStar Group. This includes 138,000 square feet that the <span class="companylink">CIT Group</span> is subleasing at 505 Fifth Avenue, the Jones Group's 263,000-square-foot lease at 1411 Broadway that expires in January, and the Girl Scouts of America's 178,500 square foot lease at 420 Fifth Avenue, which also ends in January. In February, <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> Labs New York's 76,000 square-foot-lease expires at 1065 Avenue of the Americas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite these looming vacancies, the ability to buy property at bargain prices is attracting buyers. This summer, the HFZ Capital Group acquired the site of a stalled hotel and condominium development at 14-20 West 40th Street. Ascent Real Estate Advisors had planned a 31-story building, including a 150-room hotel and 60 condominium units, but it defaulted on its mortgage. HFZ paid $41 million for the mortgage and $5 million for the deed, said Ziel Feldman, the managing principal of HFZ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Feldman said he had received offers from hotel companies interested in a flagship, and added that he was considering doing only a hotel project and forgoing condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area is ripe for hotel development, said Faith Hope Consolo, chairwoman of the retail leasing, marketing and sales division at Prudential Douglas Elliman. She pointed to the Setai Fifth Avenue that opened this month at 37th Street and the Andaz 5th Avenue that opened at 41st Street this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new CUNY lease is part of a larger strategy for Allied Partners. The company has spent the last decade acquiring surrounding air rights and buildings, including the acquisition this summer of 54 West 40th Street. With close to 300,000 square feet of developable space, Allied Partners is working with the British architect Norman Foster on the design for a mixed-use project that would build on top of 54 West 40th and cantilever to the 50 West 40th Street building. Construction, however, is unlikely to take place for a number of years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I HAVE never made a deal in the rain,'' said Fredrik Eklund, standing in bright sunlight in a $2.8 million apartment on the Bowery that offered 360-degree views of seemingly every landmark in New York City. ''People need to see a place in good weather to appreciate it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eklund knows about good lighting. On paper, he could be just another charismatic, hyper-aggressive broker in the city's cutthroat real estate market. As a managing director of Core Group Marketing, a boutique real estate firm in Chelsea, he has a portfolio worth more than $58 million, putting him at No. 37 in The Real Deal's listing of top brokers in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His success in the United States has made Mr. Eklund, a member of a prominent Swedish family, with ties to prime ministers, the royal family, even the legendary director Ingmar Bergman, somewhat of a minor celebrity back in his native Stockholm, and the subject of glowing profiles in the Swedish press. But it's more than just his ability to close million-dollar deals that has brought him that fame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also that other career of his: that of a one-time actor who starred in a half-dozen adult films under the nom de porn Tag Eriksson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the whiff of scandal or maybe because of it, Mr. Eklund moved to the United States eight years ago -- with zero clients and no real estate training -- and built an enviable practice that now includes marquee clients like Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake and the Olsen twins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The unglamorous answer is that you work harder than anyone else,'' Mr. Eklund said as he moved lithely around the apartment, fussing with details as a photographer took shots for its listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon there may be more than just a lone photographer following Mr. Eklund around Manhattan as he readies apartments for viewing. On Thursday afternoon, word leaked out that he is in talks with Bravo to star in a reality show about New York real estate brokers. The news, however, may not go over well with his bosses. Because Core has an existing show on HGTV, it might put his future with the firm in doubt. But Mr. Eklund says he isn't concerned. ''Life is a big tasty smorgasbord,'' he said. ''And there are a lot of really good-looking sandwiches to try.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents are renowned for having the best apartments, and Mr. Eklund's bachelor pad on Astor Place is no exception. A roomy one-bedroom with arched windows that face downtown, it has a decor that looks as if it came from one of the better catalogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dozen family photographs in silver frames are hung together over the credenza. The Eklunds are so attractive that they seem to conform to a cultural stereotype of Swedishness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One picture shows Mr. Eklund and his brother, Sigge, both in tuxedos, flanking their father, Klas, on his 50th birthday. The elder Mr. Eklund, in a white tux, is a senior economist of one of Sweden's largest corporate banks, SEB, and was closely allied with Carl Bildt and Olof Palme, two of the country's former prime ministers. He is a celebrated public intellectual in Sweden, though he was somewhat remote as a father.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the center of the grouping is the largest picture, a black-and-white portrait of Mr. Eklund himself, shirtless and beaming, cropped above the waist with hemispheric pecs. He lives across the street from a David Barton gym, where he works out almost every morning, usually by 5 a.m. when it opens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was that body that caught the eye of an online casting agent in 2001. Wash West, a tongue-in-cheek porn director who had worked with Bruce LaBruce and others, was intrigued by Mr. Eklund's story. ''His grandfather was a famous actor in Sweden, so he came with this pedigree of Swedish theater and film,'' Mr. West said, referring to Bengt Eklund, who worked with Bergman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Tag Eriksson, Mr. Eklund appeared in approximately six films shot in California in 2001 and 2002, including ''The Hole,'' a parody of the popular horror film ''The Ring.'' (In ''The Ring'' watching a cursed videotape causes the characters to die; in ''The Hole'' it makes them gay.) The film won him a 2004 GayVN award, sometimes called the gay porn Oscars, for a Best Solo Scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Eklund, the racy films offered an escape from the strictures of Old World Sweden. How others might judge him was not a concern. ''Did I ever think it would affect my career negatively?'' he said. ''No. Did I think that I might fall in love with somebody one day who might have a problem with it? Yes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before his foray into pornographic films, Mr. Eklund was a risk taker. During his first year at the Stockholm School of Economics, he started a tech company called Humany that made customer-relations software. Later he started a small music label and management company, Cave Entertainment, that had modest success in Latin America and Japan. (Its biggest hit, ''KinKi Kids Forever,'' was used in a Japanese chocolate commercial.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was already known as a young entrepreneur and his profile in Sweden exploded in 2005, when he published an autobiographical novel about his adult film career titled ''Bananflugornas herre'' or ''Lord of the Fruit Flies,'' a pun on his homosexuality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It started as a diary,'' he said. ''It was never about the movies themselves, it was about the journey a young Swedish man goes through.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the book created a stir that propelled him into the Swedish tabloids, as the gay porn star son of a public figure. ''The newspapers there follow his every move, so he's very well known,'' said his brother, Sigge, who recently moved to Los Angeles to work as a screenwriter. ''The things I hear Swedes admire most about him are his optimism and self-confidence. He's the anti-Bergman -- Bergman was a very dark and angst-ridden man, whereas Fredrik is social and cheery -- and that sells well in today's Sweden.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notably, the book was also how Mr. Eklund came out to his father as both gay and a porn actor. He e-mailed his father a draft. ''So this was his way of telling me -- a rather drastic way,'' said the elder Eklund, who was shaken by the revelation. ''I became worried, not because of the movies themselves, but I feared drugs and AIDS, probably like any caring parent would do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Father and son have since grown closer. ''Now he's out of all that, without any scars, and I'm truly happy about that,'' the father added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With considerable life experience already behind him, Mr. Eklund arrived in New York to start a new chapter. He acquired his real estate license at New York University ''because people said I would be good at it and because I have an analytic mind and social skills,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, a year into his first job at JC DeNiro, an agency owned by Robert DeNiro's uncle, Jack, Mr. Eklund did an estimated $50 million in business and was nominated for Rookie of the Year by the Real Estate Board of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He worked 85-hour weeks, and was an early adopter of Web tools. ''I think I was the first one with a BlackBerry, when it still had the wheel,'' he said. ''When I started, seven and a half years ago, listings were still coming in by fax.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within two years, he left JC DeNiro to join Core, an ambitious start-up founded by Shaun Osher, who had been a top broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman. Mr. Osher said Mr. Eklund had a particular talent for branding developments that other brokers failed to sell. As a recent example, Mr. Osher cited the Cammeyer, an elegant prewar building in the Flatiron district that was previously marketed as 650 Sixth Avenue, until Mr. Eklund found a fancier, historic-sounding moniker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eklund also keeps his numbers high by working with developers to represent every unit in a building, and has a strong reputation as a closer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are his clients. Perhaps because of his upbringing in Sweden's ruling class, he moves easily among other public figures. He runs with a glamorous set of Swedes, like Princess Madeleine, who moved to the city in April, and Caroline Winberg, a Victoria's Secret model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. Eklund remains discreet about his clients, several real estate blogs reported in May that he sold Daniel Craig, the James Bond actor, a $1.9 million TriBeCa apartment. Others he has worked with include John Legend, Jessica Alba, Paul Rudd, Rachel McAdams, Ben Stiller and Brooke Shields, according to another broker who spoke anonymously so as not to jeopardize relationships with current or potential clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I try to always make them not think of me as a broker,'' Mr. Eklund said of his ease with celebrities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now, with his potential Bravo deal in the works, he may well become one of them.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wine, 52, is the managing partner of Oliver's Realty Group, a development, investment and brokerage company that he started in September, after 32 years at the Related Companies. Mr. Wine was Related's vice chairman, and some of his most notable projects there included the <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center residences and the Superior Ink condominiums and town houses in the West Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Why leave Related now? Did anything precipitate your departure?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A There was no one event. I had a tremendous relationship with Steve Ross and the other principals. It was just a feeling that after 30-plus years it was time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through my career, I have been involved in almost every aspect of residential real estate -- from affordable housing to luxury housing to superluxury housing, and from rentals to condominiums -- and I felt it was the time to branch out and select those projects that excited me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Did you have to sign a noncompetition agreement?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We had handshakes -- we didn't have formal written agreements. I think Related will pursue many types of deals that I certainly would not be pursuing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Do you still have ties there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Even though I'm no longer an employee of Related, that doesn't negate my ownership in the buildings I worked on. When I started at Related it was very, very small, and as we built buildings, I became an equity partner in those buildings. I also own individual apartments in Manhattan -- most in Related properties -- which I have rented out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Are these properties part of the new company's portfolio?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Oliver's Realty Group is owned by my holding company, Oliver's Company, which I started in 1995, and the holding company has ownership of these properties. You grow your portfolio alongside your activities with Related.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Is the goal of Oliver's Realty to develop and market residences?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Your first development --a modern oceanfront home in Bridgehampton -- was just sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A It went for shy of $14.5 million; the list price was $14.95 million. It was on the market eight weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How many employees do you have at Oliver's Realty?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Two. Including me. But I've tried to form alliances to expand my capabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Are you working on any partnership deals?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A One of the things that I've been working on has been the Hunters Point South request for proposals by the city for a mixed-income development in Hunters Point, Queens. I am part of one of the bidding teams, with BFC Partners and Washington Square Partners. The city will hopefully decide in the next few months, and have a short list by year end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q You're also part of something called the Trio Partnership to invest in distressed opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Correct. With Robert Levine of RAL Companies -- he and I were introduced by my college roommate -- along with Pam Samuels, formerly of Extell Development. As a team, we can go after a myriad of opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q But are there any?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A There are definitely opportunities. The challenge is to distinguish between those that are challenging and sustainable and those that are dead ends. We are in discussions with lenders to take over failed deals that they have taken back from the developer. We are also in discussions with developers who need additional expertise and capital to achieve their plans. We're evaluating 10 different projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q One the biggest projects of your career was <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center. Was it most challenging?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A It was certainly the most challenging and one of my most significant achievements. The attorney general accepted an offering plan for <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center within weeks of the 9/11 tragedy. That added a whole other dimension of challenge, both as a real estate professional and as a New Yorker, because the success of the <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center really followed New York's coming back from those events. It was a one-of-a-kind development, and it set the stage for the explosion of high-end housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Do you own any units there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A No.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Oliver's Realty was named for your son. Is this the start of a family real estate dynasty?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Wouldn't that be great! Oliver just turned 21 and he's studying economics. I'm very pleased to say that he has been interning at a real estate office in the Chicago area, where he goes to college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q So what did Oliver think about having a company named after him?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Oliver asked for business cards and a title, because he told me that it would be easier to pick up girls. So he's a senior associate. We had a good laugh about it!</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE view of West Chelsea from the roof of 540 West 28th Street, a new condominium at 11th Avenue, prompts a somewhat irrational question: what housing crash?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All around, construction is buzzing and the landscape is filling up with new buildings and warehouse conversions, funky and sleek condominiums, hotels, galleries and public spaces designed by big-name architects like Frank Gehry, Jean Nouvel, Richard Meier and Annabelle Selldorf. And other projects once trapped in limbo by the mortgage and construction financing crises are moving ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last four years, 27 residential projects have come on the market in West Chelsea, a submarket of Chelsea that runs from 14th to 30th Street, west of Ninth Avenue, according to an analysis by Streeteasy.com. A building boomlet that began a decade ago intensified after the rezoning for residential use of a 15-block area and the beginning phases of the High Line park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these properties struggled after the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> two years ago. But the market is coming back, developers and brokers say -- through a combination of timing (the opening of the popular High Line), chic (art galleries) and edginess (the rezoning of an industrial area).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West Chelsea's growth came during a period of almost unheard-of building development citywide. In 2007, for example, 25,659 new units were completed. But in 2009 building permits -- a measure of future building activity -- fell by 90 percent, to 3,275 from 30,947 in 2008, and the decline has persisted in 2010, according to data compiled by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A relative lack of inventory in Chelsea is also sustaining demand in West Chelsea. There are 126 available units in Chelsea as a whole, from 14th Street to 30th Street, west of Fifth Avenue, according to Halstead Property. That is three more than were available last May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even in West Chelsea, there are pockets of hot and cold. The High Line will eventually run from Gansevoort Street to 34th Street. The first segment, stretching to 20th Street, is open. The second, extending to 30th Street, is expected to open next spring, and likely to have a similar effect on apartments in that area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 540 West 28th Street, a 12-story building called +aRt, developers have so far had a hard time selling condos. Preconstruction sales of the 91 units began in September 2008, but sales were suspended from December 2008 until last May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the units at +aRt -- half a block from the 28th Street High Line entrance -- recently returned to the market, with prices from $500,000 to $2.3 million, about 20 percent of them have sold, though most for 10 to 15 percent below asking prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across 28th Street, <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span>, a national developer, had signed a 99-year lease on about 60,000 square feet of land in 2007. A rental building with 600 to 700 units had been planned but stalled, although according to someone with knowledge of the plans who was not authorized to speak publicly, ground-breaking is anticipated for the middle of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erik T. Ekstein, the principal of Ekstein Development and one of the developers of +aRt, said he was encouraged by the current pace of sales and did not regret setting his sights on West Chelsea. The first buyers are moving into the building this week, he said, and he is also developing a 30-unit rental building at 537 West 27th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We saw what was coming north, we saw the High Line coming, we saw the art galleries,'' said Mr. Ekstein, who has also developed properties in TriBeCa and in Long Island City, Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the first developers to march into West Chelsea in the last 10 years was Cary Tamarkin, the architect and the developer of 456 West 19th Street, where 16 of 22 duplexes, ranging in price from $1.5 million to $7.9 million, are in contract or closed. Mr. Tamarkin focused his marketing efforts on the proliferation of art galleries and exhibits of globally acclaimed painters and sculptors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Art was huge,'' Mr. Tamarkin said. ''It was the whole tag line of our building,'' which is modeled after artist studios of the early 20th century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we first started thinking about this four years ago,'' he said, ''the High Line was just kind of a dream and the area was scary; it had a scary component to it at night. But it has just flourished on a straight line up from that moment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also designed and developed a building at 491-495 West Street in the West Village. But he said, ''The West Village remains great, but it's, like, done. It's like living in the suburbs. It's not edgy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the art district always had cachet, art alone was not enough to sell West Chelsea, said Leonard Steinberg, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman who specializes in West Chelsea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then came the High Line, the elevated park that is, in phases, transforming an old trestle that snakes through the West Side of Manhattan into a tourist attraction. ''Having an art gallery on your street doesn't necessarily imply quality of life,'' Mr. Steinberg said. ''Art galleries are the first indicators of a turning neighborhood, but what's happening now in West Chelsea is the perfect storm.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the massive uncertainty about the near (and long-term) future of the U.S. tax code, we recently invited Michael Mundaca, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy, to field questions from Freakonomics readers. You asked about everything from offshore tax shelters to the messy estate/death tax situation; here are his answers. A big thanks to all.Q.Is this really a good year to die - tax wise? And do you expect an uptick in deaths as the calendar year ends? Have we ever seen a similar incentive to die, and did it spur deaths? - Drill-Baby-Drill Drill Team</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When will congress straighten out the estate tax mess so that people will know how to plan? - n bergmanA.In general, I wouldn't think any year is a good year to die, but you are correct that, under current law, the estates of those who die in 2010 are not subject to the estate tax. However, not being subject to the estate tax is not advantageous to all estates and heirs. Under 2009 law, $3.5 million of each estate was essentially exempt from the estate tax, but the heirs receiving property from such an estate nevertheless received assets with a "stepped up" tax basis, meaning that when such assets were sold, tax would be due only on any appreciation during the time the heir held the asset. For example, assume that someone died with an estate valued at $3 million dollars, all in stock, which passed to one non-spouse heir. Assume that the decedent had paid $1 million for the stock. If the decedent died in 2009, no estate tax would be due (because the estate is worth less than $3.5 million), and the heir's basis in the stock would be increased to $3 million. Thus, if the heir immediately sold the stock, no capital gains tax would be due either, as there would be no gain. If instead that same person died in 2010, again no estate tax would be due, because it has been allowed to expire, but if the non-spouse heir immediately sold the stock received, capital gains tax would be due, because the value would exceed the basis. The Administration has proposed extending the estate tax (and the related gift and generation skipping taxes) at 2009 parameters (for the estate tax, an exemption amount of $3.5 million and a top rate of 45 percent). We are hopeful that Congress will address the estate tax before year end.Q.Has anyone figured out exactly how it is going to work for same-sex married couples in community property states like California? My accountant still has no clue - PaulA.Regarding tax issues faced by same-sex married couples in community property states such as California, there are some helpful IRS resources, including a Chief Counsel Memorandum issued in May of this year that addresses some tax issues faced by California Registered Domestic partners (the memo is available here). Same-sex couples should consider consulting a tax professional about their particular situation.Q.Does Warren Buffett really pay a lower tax rate than his secretary? Also, why isn't there a financial transaction tax? Wouldn't this serve to rein in speculation, which led to the great recession, as well as improving our federal balance sheet, affording for more stimulus jobs? - frankenduf</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is unearned income (capital gains) taxed at a lower rate than earned income (salary)? The naive answer is that we need to "encourage" people to commit to long-term investments. But where else would people invest their money? People make long-term investments because that is where the best returns are located. The "encouragement" of a lower capital gains tax rate would only be needed if the returns from long-term investment were worse. - fripperyA.I don't know whether Warren Buffet actually pays income tax at a lower tax rate than his secretary, but it is possible. Under current law, dividends and long-term capital gains are subject to a maximum marginal tax rate of 15 percent, while other income, such as wages, may be taxed up to a maximum marginal rate of 35 percent. (The marginal tax rate is the rate on the last dollar of income. The effective rate, which is the share of income paid in taxes, tends to be significantly lower due to factors like deductions, credits, and lower tax brackets that apply to income below a certain level.) Thus, for example, someone who has $5 million of long-term capital gains would generally pay income tax at a rate no higher than 15 percent on the capital gains, while someone with a salary significantly lower than that, say $100,000, may pay income tax at a rate higher than 15 percent. Also note that, under current law, investment income is exempt from payroll taxes, so that could also lead to lower taxes on investment income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arguments in favor of taxing capital gains at a rate lower than that for ordinary income include offsetting the taxation of purely inflationary gains; reducing the tax on risky investment that would otherwise be disadvantaged by the tax system, especially because of the limits on deducting capital losses; and offsetting the "lock-in" effect where high capital gains rates can impede economically desirable asset and portfolio reallocations by imposing a tax on the sale of capital assets that can be deferred to the extent that the assets are not sold. With the exception of a few years following the Tax Reform Act of 1986, long-term capital gains generally have been taxed at preferential rates since 1921.Q.Any new changes as it pertains to required mandatory distributions? Or qualified retirement plan pre-mature distributions? Lots of clients have had to take more out of roll-over IRAs to survive their unemployment thank you -&nbsp;LauraA.There are no new changes for 2010. The longstanding required minimum distribution rules generally require qualified retirement plan and traditional IRA distributions to start shortly after age 70 1/2 and to be completed over an individual's (or an individual's and a beneficiary's) lifetime. These rules reflect the purpose of a tax-favored retirement plan - to provide financial security during retirement, not to allow deferral of income tax on retirement assets indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, the premature distribution rules are generally designed to encourage preservation of these assets until retirement. When qualified plan or IRA assets are taken out prematurely, the law imposes an extra 10 percent tax that recaptures part of the tax savings that result from the deferral of tax on plan and IRA contributions and earnings. Without such rules, retirement plan assets could be used at any time for any purpose, and retirement plans would become little more than vehicles for making deductible contributions to tax-sheltered accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to the financial crisis that began in the fall of 2008, Congress, on a one-time-only basis, waived the requirement to take a distribution in 2009. In assessing any additional changes to these rules, it is important to balance any short-term benefit against possible long-term effects on retirement security, and on the <span class="companylink">deficit.Q.Google</span> cuts its tax bill by over $1 billion per year by clearing most of its foreign profits through Ireland and the Netherlands to Bermuda. Is this a good loophole for American corporations by lowering already high corporate tax rates relative to the rest of the world? Would shutting this technique down increase tax revenue or drive business away? -&nbsp;Marty SternA.I can't comment on any particular taxpayer's tax positions or tax strategies, but the Administration is concerned about U.S. companies' shifting of profits out of the United States to avoid U.S. taxes. In our FY2011 Budget, we proposed tightening the tax rules governing the transfer of intangible assets-patents and copyrights, for example-to low-tax jurisdictions, which is a strategy some businesses use to inappropriately reduce their U.S. tax bills. Addressing it as we have proposed would make it harder to shift profits overseas to avoid U.S. tax and thereby increase U.S. tax revenues.Q.Having paid a minor differential due to the AMT in two separate years, two things have stuck in my mind regarding AMT: first, it seems to be in implementation, more or less the "flat tax" Grover Norquist and the like are always gasbagging on about; and second, it doesn't seem like it would have been difficult to tie the cutoff limit to some other federal definition of inflation such as the CPI-U or COLA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I gather that, in olden times, "the law" as an entity didn't have a good understanding of inflation, but it seems that in the last 50 years, the federal government now has a good institutional understanding of inflation. The question remains, why can't the AMT limits (and the annual process of adjusting other income limits for marginal rates, IRA contributions, and so on) just become automatically tied to some federal measure of inflation? Why does every Congress need to twiddle the dials on these amounts? Is "always having cutoff amounts in political play" some kind of degree of freedom that tax policy horse trading needs? -&nbsp;keithA.The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was introduced in 1969, although its current form dates essentially from 1982. As you note, the AMT parameters, unlike many other aspects of the Internal Revenue Code, are not indexed for inflation. Thus, without changes, more and more taxpayers would be subject to the AMT each year. Congress has acted over the years to increase the exemption amount and change other aspects of the AMT, and more recently has enacted one-year "patches" to keep the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT essentially constant. No patch has yet been enacted for 2010, however. The Administration has proposed to eliminate the uncertainty of these year-by-year fixes and provide permanent protection to taxpayers by indexing the parameters for inflation based on the 2009 level. We are hopeful that Congress will address this issue before year end.Q.I work for a (very) small business, namely an unincorporated sole proprietorship.&nbsp;As I understand it, the new healthcare law requires us to issue 1099s for goods purchased in excess of $400. This is a huge hassle, and I have a few questions regarding it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. How do we issue a 1099 to an entity that, as far as I know, lacks a TIN (such as our local government for our property taxes)?B. How do we issue a 1099 to an entity that will not reveal their SSN/TIN (such as a seller on e-bay or a non-chain store)?C. How do we issue a 1099 to an entity that we do not have an address for (such as a seller on e-bay or Amazon Marketplace)?D. When we use an intermediary forum to make a purchase, such as Amazon Marketplace, do we issue a 1099 to Amazon, or to the actual vendor?E. Will this in fact generate more revenue than the total amount spent by businesses &amp; the IRS on enforcing this insanity?- Peter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's this change with the 1099 needing to be sent to corporations (rather than the previous rule, in which you sent it only to sole proprietorships and partnerships)?&nbsp;Does it apply only to businesses, or should every single resident be sending a 1099 to the grocery store and the electric utility next year? -&nbsp;I wonderA.Under the rules currently in effect, businesses have to report payments of $600 or more for services (but not goods) when such payments are made to non-corporate entities such as partnerships and sole proprietorships (but not when they are made to corporations). Starting with transactions in 2012, businesses must report payments of $600 or more for both services and goods to both non-corporate and corporate entities. The new law seeks to increase the information available to the IRS, in order to improve tax compliance. While businesses do not need to start filing information returns on the expanded set of payments until January of 2013, some groups have already raised concerns about the burden that this new provision may impose. As the President has said, it is important to look at whether this burden is too great for businesses to manage. Treasury and IRS are sensitive to these concerns and will look for opportunities to minimize burden and avoid duplicative reporting. Over the last few months, we have been soliciting input from businesses of all types and sizes, as well as their advisors and service providers, regarding how best to implement the law. Already, we have used our administrative authority to exempt from this new requirement business transactions conducted using payment cards such as credit and debit cards. So, whenever a business uses a credit or debit card, no information report will need to be filed, and there will thus be no new burden under the new law. We look forward to gathering input from the business community, and as we proceed with our implementation planning, we won't hesitate to consider alternate approaches, including working with Congress, to address any potential implementation issues that may arise during this process.Q.Is there any way for a taxpayer to get accurate (and up to date) information on where and how my taxes are being spent? I am interested in rather detailed explanations. Not just categories like military, social programs etc.&nbsp;If there is not, why not? I expect those taxing me to be able to track those funds. Transparency.&nbsp;- JerodA.The Administration publishes each year an analysis of the Federal budget, which includes a good deal of detail regarding Federal expenditures and receipts. For the current budget, see here, and for past budgets take a look at this. In the current budget, you can find a lot of detail on precisely how much is spent on each agency and program - from total salaries paid by the Supreme Court to the medical services provided to veterans through the VA, for example - in Table 33-1, available here. In addition, a less detailed pie chart of Federal government expenditures is contained in the instruction booklet for the annual individual income tax return.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NORTH LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Save Florida Homes Inc. and its owner, Mark Guerette, have found foreclosed homes for several needy families here in Broward County, and his tenants could not be more pleased. Fabian Ferguson, his wife and two children now live a two-bedroom home they have transformed from damaged and abandoned to full and cozy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is just one problem: Mr. Guerette is not the owner. Yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of the odd ingenuity that has grown from the real estate collapse, he is banking on an 1869 Florida statute that says the bundle of properties he has seized will be his if the owners do not claim them within seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A version of the same law was used in the 1850s to claim possession of runaway slaves, though Mr. Guerette, 47, a clean-cut mortgage broker, sees his efforts as heroic. ''There are all these properties out there that could be used for good,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The North Lauderdale authorities, though, see him as a crook. He is scheduled to go on trial in December on fraud charges in a case that, along with a handful of others in Florida and in other states, could determine whether maintaining a property and paying taxes on it is enough to lead to ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legal scholars say the concept is old -- rooted in Renaissance England, when agricultural land would sometimes go fallow, left untended by long-lost heirs. But it is also common. All 50 states allow for so-called adverse possession, with the time to forge a kind of common-law marriage with property varying from a few years (in most states) to several decades (in New Jersey).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statute generally requires that properties be maintained openly and continuously, which usually means paying property taxes and utility bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not clear how many people are testing the idea, but lawyers say that do-it-yourself possession cases have been popping up all over the country -- and, they note, these self-proclaimed owners play an odd role in a real-estate mess that never seems to end. Though they may cringe at the analogy, as squatters with bank accounts, these adverse possessors are like leeches, and it can be difficult to tell at times whether they are cleaning a wound already there, or making it worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, Florida is where they thrive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many residents of the Sunshine State have grown accustomed to living beside a home left vacant for years. Now hundreds of these mold-filled caverns, their appliances long ago spirited off, are being claimed by strangers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are all kinds of ways the people try to manipulate the system to their own financial gain,'' said Jack McCabe, an independent real estate analyst with McCabe Research and Consulting. ''And you are going to see it here because Florida is the capital of real estate fraud.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Guerette, who now faces up to 15 years in prison, insists that his business is legitimate and moral. He said he got started last year, driving around working-class neighborhoods in Palm Beach and Broward Counties, looking for a particular kind of home: not just those with overgrown lawns and broken windows, but houses with a large orange sticker from the county reading ''public nuisance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stickers signaled owners out of touch: the county or city was unable to reach them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Guerette filed court claims on around 100 of these properties, which appear to be in the process of foreclosure. Then he chose 20 that could be most easily renovated and sent letters to the owners and their banks -- presumably overwhelmed -- to make them aware of his plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida does not require notification. One state lawmaker tried and failed to close that loophole last year with a bill that never passed. But it hardly mattered. Nineteen of the owners and their banks did not respond, Mr. Guerette said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he set about fixing up the unclaimed properties. In some cases, he just mowed the lawn and replaced stolen air conditioners or broken windows; in other cases, like with Mr. Ferguson, he let tenants make improvements in lieu of rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At his peak last year, he said he managed 17 homes with renters, some of whom he found on Craigslist, others through a Christian ministry in Margate, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copies of leases show Mr. Guerette included an addendum noting that he was not the legal owner. Tenants like Mr. Ferguson and his family, who had been homeless before moving in last year and paying $289 a month, see Mr. Guerette as a savior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And neighbors generally agree. ''There is no telling who was in and out of that house,'' said Rawle Thomas, who lives next door to Mr. Ferguson and his family. ''I like them, and I'd much rather have someone in there than the house empty.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other cases, though, adverse possession has been more aggressive and problematic. In Palm Beach County, Carl Heflin spent a year in jail awaiting trial on fraud, trespassing and burglary charges. But after accepting a plea agreement and the rejection of his adverse possession claims, he was arrested again on charges of trying to collect back rents on houses he had tried to possess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The whole time he was harassing us and threatened to burn the house down with my kids in it,'' said Misty Hall, a single mother of two who rented a home from Mr. Heflin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam Goren, city attorney for North Lauderdale, said any benefits were outweighed by a simple fact that adverse possessors often overlook: they are trespassing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Allan Wolf, a real estate expert at the University of Florida law school, said adverse possessors also disrupt the chain of title. Rightful owners end up having to evict tenants. The time between foreclosure and legitimate resale may be extended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when adverse possessors help stabilize neighborhoods, ''It is not an effective or efficient cure for the foreclosure crisis in Florida,'' Professor Wolf said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Guerette says his goals are more charitable. After several marriages, six children and some minor trouble with the law, he said, he is now a born-again Christian who sees his new company as a way to make an honest living, and solve a dire need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His tenants confirmed that after he was arrested in April, he told them they could stop paying rent. Even if he is not allowed to keep taking homes, he said, why should needy people not be matched with homes left to decay?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are over 4,000 homeless in Broward, and the number is growing all the time,'' he said. ''I thought I could use these homes and put people into them. It could be a good thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''It's not rocket science.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many creative professionals who live in Williamsburg, Lewis Canfield possesses a Renaissance man's variety of passions and hobbies. He worked in the movie industry, profited from the Internet boom, dabbled in art, developed an interest in women's perfume scents and now buys, sells and renovates Brooklyn real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No topic has captured his attention lately more than vinyl siding. One might assume that Mr. Canfield's background puts him squarely in Brooklyn's antivinyl camp, but beneath that artsy exterior is a guy who actually likes vinyl siding, when well applied. A lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, as Mr. Canfield drove down Williamsburg streets lined with brilliantly colored trees and paler vinyl-sided buildings, he pointed out his favorite examples. He likes neatly lined siding, siding blazed by the sun until a patina forms, siding intended to look like wooden shingles and traditional designs that try to approximate George Washington's Mount Vernon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Mr. Canfield, replacing vinyl siding that is in good shape, as some homebuyers do as soon as they have the deed, is like carelessly restoring antiques that came over on the Mayflower. He views vinyl siding facades as the key to preserving Williamsburg's working-class traditions, which arguably has become its own facade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not the most beautiful thing, but it's real,'' he said. ''It's authentic. It's tied to the history of the neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a neighborhood like Williamsburg where vinyl siding is as dominant as brownstone is in Park Slope and concrete is in Midtown, many residents are ready to fight with Mr. Canfield with equal passion. Real estate bloggers devote hours mercilessly photographing homes and posting online what they think are the most lowbrow examples. To the preservation-minded, vinyl siding and its close cousin, aluminum siding, are a hideous blot on the landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't imagine anyone liking vinyl siding,'' said Robert Lanham, who rents a floor in a Pepto-Bismol-colored vinyl-sided house in Williamsburg and praises neighbors who go back to wood. ''If you have the means and time to get rid of it, I'm all for it,'' said Mr. Lanham, author of ''The Hipster Handbook.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. Canfield may be one of the few vocal supporters of vinyl siding's appearance, untold millions of homeowners have wrapped their homes in the stuff for more practical reasons, after tiring of frequently repainting or repointing and fighting the effects of rain, sun and rot. Since the artificial siding requires very little upkeep, many of these exteriors have remained untouched for decades, becoming, as Mr. Canfield puts it, their own kind of historical ''time warp.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Hohmann, the owner of Top Line, a vinyl siding installer based in Brooklyn, said he still got plenty of business from people adding, or upgrading, their siding. Now, he said, his customers are not so much the aging Italian families who long gave him business there, but tend to be young professional couples, and they are choosing more traditional Dutch colonial siding, the kind that looks almost like clapboard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is only welcome news to Mr. Canfield, who has handled about a dozen sales of vinyl-sided Williamsburg homes over the past three years. He pulled up before 45 Powers Street, a house with vinyl siding in the back that he sold in 2008. (The front exterior is made of cement board siding.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Friedman, who bought the house for $1.3 million, shares Mr. Canfield's sentiments He feels a connection to the neighborhood because his grandmother was born nearby. He prefers vinyl-sided homes to his friends' brick-front town houses in Cobble Hill and Brooklyn Heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To me, it's more of a, like, bourgeois town over there,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''Williamsburg feels more like a neighborhood, a little less stately, more flavor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Canfield drove up to 171 North Eighth Street, which has a vinyl-sided front and sun-baked asphalt shingles on its side. One client recently lost a bid on that property, which was listed for $835,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Mr. Canfield bought his own vinyl-sided home in Williamsburg for $640,000. He plans to keep it as it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's in good condition and it's doing its job,'' he said. ''If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Vinyl to Stainless</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Edrei, who lives nearby in Greenpoint, does not share Mr. Canfield's love of vinyl siding. When Mr. Edrei, a commercial real estate lender, bought his vinyl-sided house on Green Street in 2005, he thought it was so hideous that, he said, he ''couldn't stand the look of it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Edrei was not one to fall in with the real-wood movement. So he covered the front and back in stainless steel in an oblong design that he said was inspired by Frank Gehry and Dr. Seuss. ''It's sleek, it's clean, it's sexy,'' he said. He kept the sides in vinyl siding, kind of like a chicken drumstick sticking out of its tinfoil wrapping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exterior led to puzzled looks from his Polish neighbors, praise from newer residents he calls ''condo kids'' and plenty of material for bloggers. The blog Curbed called it the ''Subzero'' and cracked, ''if only it had an icemaker on the front.'' One blogger, a Miss Heather, wrote that it should ''be used as gallows for the owner of this property.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge came when Mr. Edrei put the house up for sale in March for $1.4 million. After a price cut, Mr. Edrei has received a serious offer close to the new $1.15 million asking price, said his agent, Lior Politi of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let us hope the buyer has an appreciation for jokes about Popsicles and crisper drawers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STANDING on the roof of the Edge, a luxury waterfront condominium project under construction in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, you can't help but be taken in by the grand sweep of the Manhattan skyline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what Jeffrey E. Levine, the developer whose company is building the Edge, sees when he looks to the north are vast swaths of undeveloped land stretching along the Brooklyn and Queens waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a great opportunity to buy land and warehouse it for development,'' said Mr. Levine, the president of Levine Builders, which operates Douglaston Development, builder of the Edge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many other major developers, real estate lawyers and city officials are thinking along similar lines. Even with new construction slowed by a troubled financing environment, the groundwork is being laid for the next great phase of waterfront development in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bloomberg administration recently unveiled a draft of a comprehensive waterfront plan, known as Vision 2020, that includes more than 500 prospective projects costing tens of millions of dollars. These range from efforts to increase access to the water for kayakers and canoeists, to measures to protect against rising sea levels resulting from climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vision 2020 is a blueprint for the next 10 years and beyond that will change the way New Yorkers live for generations to come,'' Amanda Burden, the director of the Department of City Planning, said in October at a public hearing on the report's recommendations. She said that the goal was for the water to become the ''sixth borough.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The water should become a part of our everyday lives,'' Ms. Burden declared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of aggressive rezoning and more than a decade of environmental cleanup, sizable tracts of land along nearly 600 miles of waterfront in all five boroughs are positioned for development. And despite persistent uncertainty in the real estate market, the dozen or more large-scale residential projects that are soon to begin construction, are under way or were recently completed across the city will provide the foundation for that next phase of building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That being said, even with the groundwork laid out more clearly than at any time in recent years, a casual reading of the history of development in the city reminds us that the grand plans of today have a way of falling apart if public support, municipal needs and private profit cannot be made to converge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borough by Borough</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dozens of large-scale plans by private developers are being matched by equally ambitious city projects. A snapshot of a few projects gives a sense of the scope of what could come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, where waterfront land is scarce and commands premium prices, construction could begin soon on one of the last large parcels of the Hudson waterfront, in the West 50s, pending approval by the City Council. On the East Side, from South Street Seaport to Harlem -- already the site of a new recreational pier -- the city is betting that its investment of more than $150 million in new piers, parks and greenways will have the same impact that Hudson River Park had on residential and commercial property values on the West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn, developers have put forth ambitious plans for construction near established waterfront neighborhoods in Williamsburg and Greenpoint, including a $1.4 billion plan to turn the former Domino Sugar factory into residential housing with about 2,200 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Queens, the city is planning the largest project of below-market-rate, or affordable, housing to be built in three decades, around 5,000 apartments, on the barren stretch known as Hunters Point. The infrastructure is being put in place to support the new community; developers have submitted bids; the city is expected to pick a winner by the end of the year and to begin construction by spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Bronx, the city has rezoned large sections of the waterfront to encourage residential development, including the lower part of the Grand Concourse and Hunts Point. The plan would create a greenway along the Bronx River from Hunts Point to Westchester County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on Staten Island, the old Navy Homeport, a 35-acre decommissioned base, would be developed into a largely residential neighborhood, with the city investing $33 million in road improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because one of the traditional hurdles to waterfront development has been lack of public transportation, the city is planning a pilot program that would expand water taxi service along the East River, similar to the service on the Hudson between Manhattan and New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Groundwork</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of building will generally correspond with broader economic conditions; even so, several projects are already moving ahead, while developers of other parcels are securing approvals and permits so that they can move quickly when the time is right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the past, when we have faced budgetary constraints, we chose to defer large infrastructure projects,'' said Seth W. Pinsky, the president of the <span class="companylink">New York City Economic Development Corporation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This time we have been able to keep all of our major projects moving forward, and we expect to have shovels in the ground on many of these headline projects within a matter of months.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By laying the groundwork now, Mr. Pinsky said, ''everything is in place so that when the climate turns, private developers will be able to ride the cycle up from the beginning rather than rush to meet it at the end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result, over the next decade, could be a market larger by tens of thousands of rental apartments and condos -- both affordable housing and luxury homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, grand visions have fallen short in the past -- or taken much longer than predicted. Both city officials and developers say using the current lull in the market wisely is critical to waterfront development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the more than 250 people who packed into a meeting room in the West Village last month to hear the city's Vision 2020 presentation, the environmental impact of any planned projects was of most concern. Some also expressed the sentiment that the city was too generous with developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the final draft of the plan is not due until the end of the year, city officials say that their goal is to work with developers in order to get them to pay for public improvements, often through specific provisions written into the zoning regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This administration's philosophy has long been to seed investments with public money in order to leverage investments by the private sector,'' Mr. Pinsky said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That can mean developers' spending millions on parks, schools, piers and bulkheads -- costs that play a role in how they price their properties. In this economic climate, some developers are balking at the city's demands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Scale of Things</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, waterfront parcels tend to be large, underused industrial sites, making it easier for developers to create more ambitious projects than in developed parts of town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, the Edge, on the East River around North Sixth Street, is the one of the largest condominium projects in Brooklyn. It includes a 30-story tower with 360 luxury units, a 15-story tower with 205 residences and lower-rise buildings with 360 below-market-rate units. Mr. Levine plans one more building on the site but is waiting for the economic forecast to improve before breaking ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, T. F. Cornerstone has been working on an outsize condo/rental development in Long Island City, Queens. In addition to a 498-unit rental building and a 184-unit luxury condo that have been built, four planned rental buildings would add more than 2,600 apartments to the neighborhood and test people's willingness to pay for stunning views in a neighborhood with few services that is still defining itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think in nearly all instances, the type of development and scale of that development on water's edge is different than what happens inland,'' said Jon McMillan, the director of planning at T. F. Cornerstone. On the waterfront, he said, ''you have kind of a clean slate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the more ambitious undertakings in Manhattan is the Riverside Center complex being built by the Extell Development Corporation. The project, between 59th and 61st Streets along the Hudson River, recently won a key approval from the City Planning Commission despite complaints that its five residential buildings -- with nearly 3,000 housing units on eight acres -- would overcrowd schools, become an enclave for the wealthy, and skimp on retail space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Barnett, the president of Extell, said that the ''quantum leap'' in demands being put on developers could even now stifle new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The question is whether some of these projects will ever get going,'' he said. ''Is it financially feasible because of all the requirements put on them?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He ran through the list of the things he has been asked to do in order to build Riverside Center: pay for part of a new school; use an expensive architectural plan preferred by the city; mitigate environmental problems at a nearby Con-Edison plant; set aside 35 percent of the land as open space; meet retail requirements; and create 500,000 square feet of affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of this costs money,'' Mr. Barnett said. ''All of these projects -- and I don't say mine are exempt -- are in danger.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many of the major waterfront projects, the Extell development has been in the works for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McMillan, who was the director of planning for Battery Park City from 1985 to 1997, said it had really been only in recent years that Battery Park City had established a firm neighborhood identity of its own, even though it was conceived in 1968.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, projects like the one he is working on in Long Island City will take years to come into shape, but the foundations being built today are critical to the kind of neighborhood that will develop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are essentially building a community here,'' Mr. McMillan said. ''When you are starting a new neighborhood, you really do have to start with rental housing to get things started,'' in part because ''young renters are often willing to make do without essential neighborhood services.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, many of the buildings in the pipeline today are likely to be rentals as opposed to condominiums, because they are a safer bet financially. Landlords can always lower rents until the economy improves, then raise those rents and still make money, whereas developers who sell condos at a loss cannot recoup it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy may be driving some of the changes in the types of projects likely to be built along the waterfront, but large tracts on the outskirts of established neighborhoods allow for greater freedom in design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In Battery Park City,'' Mr. McMillan said, ''we were going for that 'Ye Olde New York' look, paying special attention to historical precedence.'' He noted that that meant a lot of brick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now, I think people are less interested in creating a kind of prewar aesthetic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is encouraging higher-rise development right on the water, perhaps reshaping the skyline in Brooklyn and Queens. Advances in glass technology allow developers to be more creative in design as they build communities where none existed before. ''The water's edge is a chance to do something different,'' Mr. McMillan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public and Private</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is dictating that most of the new waterfront projects have a below-market-rate component, usually starting at about 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even with those units, the demand for affordable housing is still overwhelming. The Bloomberg administration hopes that the huge housing project at Hunters Point, on an empty finger of land jutting out from southwest Queens, will help ease the crunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it is complete, it will rival Co-op City in the Bronx as the largest affordable housing complex in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly a dozen developers have submitted bids to build apartments for the first phase of the project; the winning bid is to be chosen by the end of the year and construction to begin as early as 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The waterfront in the city is so extensive,'' said Mr. Pinsky of the economic development corporation, ''that we really have the opportunity to do everything.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AFTER a rapid plunge, the pace of residential construction in the United States has stabilized. But any respite for the economy that could have been provided by the end of that decline has been more than offset by a drop in privately financed nonresidential construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now even publicly financed construction has begun to slide on a year-over-year basis, something that has not happened since 1984.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid decline in nonresidential construction reflects the fact that commercial projects often cannot be stopped immediately, even if the market has soured. Finishing a building is usually preferable to leaving it half built, since there is no possibility of renting out an unfinished shell. That helped to keep such spending up early in the recession, but it has since fallen off rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures for September, released this week, showed that residential construction spending rose a little compared with August, but remained well below year-ago levels. At the same time, figures for almost every category of nonresidential spending showed declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-to-month figures can be volatile because of weather, even though the Census Bureau applies seasonal adjustments. The accompanying charts are based on total spending over 12-month periods, and compare one period to the same period a year earlier. The figures are in actual dollars, not adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private residential construction spending took off early in this century, rising to a peak in 2006. For the 12 months through June of that year, Americans spent $643 billion on building homes and apartments. That spending was spurred, of course, by easy credit and by a mortgage industry that was lending money to almost anyone. By early this year, the 12-month total was down to $243 billion, a decline of more than 60 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak, residential spending amounted to 55 percent of total construction spending, a level unprecedented since the government began collecting such data in the 1960s. For many years, nonresidential and residential spending were on different cycles, with one drawing in more money when the other faltered. But that pattern ended in the early 1990s, and residential spending was virtually unaffected by the 2001 recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Publicly financed construction, largely for things like roads, schools and sewers, has been relatively steady and did not rise as rapidly during the years when the economy was booming. Now it is sliding, but not as rapidly as the other categories. It is now the largest of the three categories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom, the excesses in the economy both drove up construction costs and left many areas overbuilt, with too many homes, offices, hotels and stores. It will take time to work off those excesses, which is a why a rapid pickup in such spending seems unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a need for public infrastructure projects, and with contractors desperate for business, there is a possibility of getting such work done for less than it would otherwise cost. But there appears to be little prospect that the government will be able to take advantage of that opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While federal aid often pays for a large part of projects, a vast majority of public construction projects are undertaken and at least partly financed by state and local governments. Many of them are suffering large budget deficits, in part because falling property prices have depressed tax collections, and are hesitant to undertake projects that can be deferred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is an area where a federal stimulus program could both pay for needed projects and put to work a sector of the economy that has otherwise dubious prospects, even if the overall economy does continue to improve. Concern over federal budget deficits, however, may make Congressional approval of such a program impossible.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people who signed contracts to buy homes fell in September after two months of gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said on Friday that its index of sales agreements for previously occupied homes dropped 1.8 percent in September, to a reading of 80.9. Contract signings fell in every region of the country except the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a second report, the Federal Reserve said that consumer borrowing increased in September for the first time since January even though the category that includes credit cards dropped for a record 25th consecutive month. Consumer credit increased at an annual rate of $2.1 billion in September, the Fed said, after having fallen at a rate of $4.9 billion in August. It was only the second increase in the last 20 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For September, revolving credit, the category that includes credit cards, fell for a record 25th consecutive month, dropping by an annual rate of $8.3 billion, or 12.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The category that includes student loans and auto loans rose by $10.4 billion, or an annual rate of 7.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $2.1 billion rise in overall borrowing pushed consumer debt to a seasonally adjusted $2.4 trillion in September, down 2.9 percent from where consumer credit stood a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results on the home sales highlighted the continuing problems facing the industry as it struggles to mount a sustained recovery from the recession. Many economists had expected a 3 percent increase. The index offers an early measurement of sales activity. There is usually a one- to two-month lag between a sales contract and a completed deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reading of 100 indicates the average level of sales activity in 2001, when the index started. The reading was above the 100 threshold from March 2003 through April 2007 and then sank as the country fell into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, the pending home sales index slipped 1.7 percent in the Northeast in September compared with August and was down 28.3 percent from September 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Midwest, the index fell 5.7 percent from the previous month and was down 33 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the South, the index fell 3.5 percent from a month earlier and is 19.1 percent below the year-ago level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only the West saw an increase in pending home sales in September, a rise of 3.5 percent from August. But even with the increase, pending sales were 24.7 percent lower than September 2009.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States economy is a bit like a jetliner short on fuel these days, waiting for something to give it the oomph needed for takeoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest report offers not much by way of immediate relief, as the Commerce Department estimated on Friday that the nation's economy grew at an annual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter. That growth rate, matching the forecast, is the barest tick up from the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak report comes at a parlous time for President Obama and the Democrats, who are only days away from crucial midterm elections that are widely expected to turn out well for Republican challengers. High unemployment and soaring foreclosure numbers in the Midwest and West already made this a particularly difficult election for Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's tens of millions of unemployed -- many now jobless for close to two years -- present a political and social challenge. Two percent growth, almost all economists agree, cannot produce nearly the demand needed to reduce the nation's 9.6 percent unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade gap remained wide in the latest quarter, as imports again surged and outpaced exports, and that too could portend ill for job creation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the expected G.D.P. number, which is mostly bad news for the economy,'' Josh Bivens, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, said of the gross domestic product. ''The growth rate is just nowhere near enough to put downward pressure on unemployment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fourth quarter of last year, the picture was far brighter, when growth rose 5 percent as the country emerged from recession. But conditions have weakened considerably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand is crucial to re-igniting the economy, and demand remained flaccid in the third quarter, although there were hints of increased consumer spending. Income growth, adjusted for inflation and taxes, slowed, rising at an annualized rate of 0.5 percent in the third quarter after increasing at a 4.4 percent rate in the second. And at the other end, prices excluding food and energy increased at a rate of 0.6 percent compared with 0.8 percent in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, the economy has presented two faces, which is reflected in the latest G.D.P. numbers. There have been fledgling signs of growth: home sales and chain store sales are up a bit; a swelling equities market has raised consumer confidence a few notches; and jobless claims fell noticeably last week, albeit they are still quite high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the steroidal effect of the federal stimulus spending is fading (although more than a trace of that spending is in the growth in large highway and bridge projects found in this quarter's output numbers). City and state governments have shed tens of thousands of employees, and states face a sea of red ink as they look at next year's budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Two percent growth is not great, but it beats zero,'' said Steve Blitz, chief economist with ITG investment research. ''But the picture of the economy remains troubling. There is certainly no sign that a normal cyclical upturn is taking hold. The consumer is still underemployed and overindebted, so the normal push won't be there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic bulls are more difficult to locate now than in the spring, when the economy appeared to gain traction. But Bernard Baumohl, chief economist for the Economic Outlook Group, has lost none of his elan, saying that he spots signs of strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The main message from this report is that the economic recovery is gathering fresh momentum from the sector that matters most to this recovery: consumer spending,'' he said in an e-mail. ''Slowly but surely, worries over job security and future income growth have subsided and households appear to be more at ease about shopping.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of economic activity, remains the great unknown. Americans have shed some debt, which is good, but in an unsightly fashion, which is not so good. They have defaulted on credit card debt or have lost their homes to foreclosure in record numbers. Their spending rose this quarter and personal savings was estimated at 5.5 percent of income, compared with 5.9 percent in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But price and income growth remains too weak to banish entirely the fear that deflation might yet take hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco touched on this prospect two weeks ago in a gloomy forecast, noting that no sector of the private economy stands ready to drive a robust recovery. ''The economic recovery is proceeding at a very slow pace and has lost momentum since the spring,'' said Mary C. Daly, vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. ''Japan's experience beginning in the early 1990s underscores the risk of getting into a long period of sustained disinflation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The midterm elections on Tuesday further complicate the economic picture. After the votes are counted, and certainty edges aside uncertainty, American business may start spending a bit more and banks may start lending to small businesses. But few economists are willing to turn that wish into a forecast, not the least because political deadlock looms as a possibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Rosenberg, economist for the Canadian investment firm Gluskin Sheff and Associates, does not put a lot of faith in consumers pulling the economy out of its ditch. ''Barring divine intervention, it's not clear how the economy keeps expanding in the coming year,'' he said. ''You'll have federal spending declining and more and more folks falling out of emergency unemployment benefits.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eyes of some economists and political leaders have turned to overseas economies, in hopes that sturdier boats might come to America's aid. The Chinese economy has cooled a touch, but its engine remains impressive. And the European economies have shown signs of stabilizing of late, with Germany as a potential driver of growth (its unemployment recently reached an 18-year low). All of this could bode well for America's export sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the facts in Friday's report offered little immediate help. Imports in the third quarter once again grew faster than exports, leaving a significant trade gap. Imports grew at an annual rate of 17.4 percent, compared with a 5.0 percent gain for exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government spending began to slow, as the effects of the stimulus spending wear off. That was reflected in the unemployment numbers for September. Companies added 64,000 jobs last month, but over all, the economy lost 95,000 nonfarm jobs, the result of a 159,000 decline in government jobs. Local governments were particularly hard hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problematic factor is that consumers remain fundamentally insolvent or worried about becoming so, and too many of the major banks are zombies uninterested in commercial or industrial lending,'' said James K. Galbraith, an economics professor at the University of Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, each quarter that the economy does not lapse back into recession adds incrementally to consumer and business confidence, and perhaps eventually to growth. The great immediate test, economists say, is the fourth quarter. The hope is that small signs of market strength in recent weeks may coalesce into something that looks more like an actual recovery, and that by next spring unemployment may stabilize and the gloom may lift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As with money, there is a power of compounding the economy,'' Mr. Blitz said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MADRID -- Manolo Marban, 59, is still living in his house in Toledo and going to work in the small pink-and-aqua pet grooming shop he bought here in 2006, when he got swept up in Spain's giddy real estate boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Marban does not own either anymore. The bank foreclosed on both properties last April, and he is waiting for the courts to issue the eviction notices. For most Americans facing foreclosure, that is the end of it. But for Mr. Marban and thousands of others here, it is just the beginning of their troubles. When the gavel falls on his case, he will still owe the bank more than $140,000. ''I will be working for the bank for the rest of my life,'' Mr. Marban said recently, tears welling in his eyes. ''I will never own anything -- not even a car.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate and banking excesses in Spain were a lot like those in the United States. Construction boomed, prices rose at an astonishing pace and banks gave out loans just as fast, often to customers like Mr. Marban, who used the equity in his house to finance a mortgage for his shop. But those days are over. Spain now has the highest unemployment rate in the euro zone -- 20 percent -- and real estate prices are dropping. For many Spaniards, no longer able to pay their mortgages, the fine print in the deals they agreed to years ago is catching up with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only are Spanish mortgage holders personally liable for the full amount of the loan, but throw in penalty interest charges and tens of thousands of dollars in court fees, and people can end up, like Mr. Marban, facing a mountain of debt. Bankruptcy is not the answer, either. Mortgage debt is specifically excluded here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Effectively, you can never get rid of this debt,'' said Ada Colau, a human rights lawyer who works for Plataforma, a new advocacy group formed both to give legal advice to homeowners and to push for reform of the country's foreclosure laws. ''Other countries in the European Union also have personal debt mortgages, but you can go to the courts and get relief. Not in Spain.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several opposition parties in Parliament have been pressing for amendments to the country's foreclosure laws, including letting mortgage defaulters settle their debts with the bank by turning over the property. But the government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has opposed such a major change in lending practices. Government officials say Spain's system of personal guarantees saved its banks from the turmoil seen in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is true that we are living a hangover of a huge real estate binge,'' said Marcos Vaquer, who was the under secretary of the Housing Ministry until a government reshuffle last week. ''And it is true that far too many Spaniards have excessive debt. But we have not seen the problems of the U.S. because the guarantees here are so much better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immigrants who moved to this country in the boom years and were the first to lose their jobs in the downturn, like Jaime Abelardo, have been the most severely affected so far. Mr. Abelardo arrived in Barcelona from Ecuador in 1999 with the promise of a job in a warehouse. A few years later, he could afford to bring his family over and buy a tiny apartment. Or so he thought. But within two years, he was laid off. He blames himself for not having been more cautious. Still, he cannot get over the figures printed on the dog-eared papers he has received from the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They say he now owes nearly 260,000 euros, almost $360,000, which includes about 77,000 euros to cover all court costs, including the bank's, his lawyer said. He bought the apartment for less than that -- about 220,000 euros, he thinks, though many aspects of the deal were never clear to him. His wife has left him. His unemployment payments are about to run out. He would like to go back to Ecuador with his four children, but he does not have enough money. ''I'm thinking about shooting myself,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 1.4 million Spaniards are facing potential foreclosure proceedings, according to Spain's consumer protection association, known as the Adicae. Recent figures from the courts show that the numbers are rising fast. In 2007, there were just 26,000 foreclosures. Last year, there were more than 93,000. Early indications suggest that they will be higher again in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> report found that 8 percent of Spain's housing is now worth less than the value of the mortgage, and with prices continuing to fall, experts believe, that figure could rise to 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates say that Spain's foreclosure procedures tilt far too much in favor of the banks, virtually guaranteeing that mortgage defaulters will end up owing large amounts after they lose their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks have the right to auction houses in foreclosure. If no buyers appear, as is often the case these days, the bank can take ownership of the house for 50 percent of its value, according to the estimate either at the time of purchase, or at the current time, depending on what the mortgage specifies. The banks then have 15 years to go after the homeowner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the banks initiate proceedings at any point, the clock starts ticking again, experts say. In the meantime, the bank can charge interest on that debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montse Andres Sabate, a lawyer with Ausbanc, a consumer association that specializes in banking services, says the banks usually charge 5 or 6 percent, but sometimes much more. ''We've seen 18 or even 19 percent,'' Ms. Andres said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there is the matter of guarantors. Bankers pressed many homeowners to find guarantors at the time they took out the mortgages or when they began to struggle to make payments. Mario Gozalvez, a truck driver, asked his 23-year-old daughter to act as a guarantor when he used the equity in his Barcelona apartment to buy a truck three years ago. At the time, she did not even have a job, and he thought of it as a silly formality. Now, she faces a lifetime of paying off his debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She may not be able to inherit anything from her mother because the bank can seize it,'' Mr. Gozalvez said. ''No one explains this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in the crisis, experts say, the banks were lenient with immigrants who had no assets and accepted the property as payment for the loan. But some advocates say they are tougher now. Under the law, the banks have the right to collect a percentage of a debtor's income if it is above $835 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santos Gonzalez Sanchez, the chairman of the Spanish Mortgage Association, says it is the bank's duty to try to collect. ''This helps to explain why our financial entities have not gone bankrupt,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal liability mortgages are common in Europe. But advocates here say that aspects of Spain's procedures -- how quickly banks can foreclose, the interest rates they can charge and the repayment schedules they can demand -- are particularly severe. This month, even Mr. Zapatero's party joined in voting for a parliamentary motion to slow foreclosure proceedings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marban knew he was in trouble within months of buying the pet store as his business began to taper off. To keep the bank from foreclosing, he gave it whatever he could scrape together. At one point, he sold his car at a huge discount to meet a payment. Eventually, he sold his wife's gold bracelet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was no good. He could never catch up on what he owed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's funny, when I finally lost the house, I started sleeping,'' he said. ''I cry sometimes, but at least I sleep now.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHARLES V. BAGLI   </div><div>704 words</div><div>27 October 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>24</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From his office at <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center, the developer Stephen M. Ross looked directly across Columbus Circle to a nearly vacant, financially troubled and, in his view, ugly, 26-story building. This being New York, where real estate is often a blood sport, he decided to do something about it. His firm, Related Companies, bought the $250 million mortgage on the property in September, intending to foreclose on the owner, demolish the building and erect a sleek skyscraper slightly taller than his 750-foot, two-towered <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Tuesday, the owner of the building that offended Mr. Ross, the rival developer Joseph Moinian, fought back, filing a 33-page lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan accusing his lender and Mr. Ross of a ''long-lived predatory lending scheme'' designed to steal the building, known as 3 Columbus Circle, for a fraction of what it was worth. He wants $200 million in damages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related Companies said the suit was ''totally without merit.'' But Mr. Moinian also enlisted a big-time partner, <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty</span>, a publicly traded real estate company that owns 30 office towers in New York City, in his struggle to hang on to 3 Columbus Circle and complete a $175 million renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SL Green is not party to the lawsuit, but its willingness to enter the fray and invest in Mr. Moinian's project makes it possible for Mr. Moinian to pay off his old mortgage, which is in default. But that is by no means a certainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Related tried to steal this building,'' said Mr. Moinian's lawyer, Stephen B. Meister. ''They're not going to succeed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meister says Mr. Moinian will pay the mortgage. The question is how much he will have to pay. Mr. Ross contends that the mortgage has swelled to $310 million with interest and penalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meister counters that Related's number includes a ''bogus'' $54 million prepayment penalty, which Mr. Moinian refuses to pay. Mr. Moinian does have assurances from SL Green that it will provide a new $250 million mortgage and have an equity stake in the property, if and when the Related mortgage is paid off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related said the lawsuit was ''designed to attempt to excuse the borrower's default in its mortgage obligations.'' Mark Walfish, a lawyer for Related, said the company hoped Mr. Moinian and his partners would fulfill their obligations and ''pay the approximately $310 million owed on the loan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many developers during the real estate boom, Mr. Moinian went on a shopping spree, accumulating 20 million square feet of property in Manhattan and elsewhere. When property values and rents plunged after 2007, Mr. Moinian ran into trouble with his lenders. He has restructured hundreds of millions of dollars in loans on three properties downtown, but he is behind on payments for three other buildings, including the W New York Hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He bought 3 Columbus Circle, also known as 1775 Broadway, in 2004 and refinanced the property two years later, borrowing $250 million from <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>. Mr. Moinian wanted to convert the building to a first-class office tower, even as other developers were canceling plans for office towers on nearby sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He defaulted on that mortgage in January. Nine months later, Related bought the note and moved to foreclose, and Mr. Ross announced on CNBC that ''there is a higher and better use for that property.'' He added, ''We are hoping to do something there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. Moinian had spent $100 million renovating the building, including its new glassy exterior, Mr. Ross wanted to tear it down. He planned to put a Nordstrom department store in the base of a new skyscraper designed by a famous architect, with about 140 condominiums on the upper floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the suit, Mr. Moinian claims that his lender and Mr. Ross scuttled leases with two potential tenants by insisting on a demolition clause, requiring the companies to vacate. He plans to ask a judge to let him pay off the mortgage while he and Related battle in court over damages and whether Mr. Moinian will be required to pay the $54 million penalty.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers of a condominium building at 100 11th Avenue in Manhattan got off to a rough start. In excavating the site they hit mud instead of bedrock, which led to long delays; by the time the 54 units were ready for occupancy, the demand for high-end condominiums had softened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least 16 units in the building, which overlooks the Hudson River at West 19th Street, remain unsold. And the commercial space that occupies much of the building's ground floor is vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the developers, Cape Advisors, had an ace in the hole: architecture by Jean Nouvel, a Pritzker Prize-winner with a towering international reputation. Mr. Nouvel has been the focus of an elaborate marketing campaign for the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the developers face a quandary. Real estate agents attribute slow sales in part to the lobby designed by Mr. Nouvel, a stark black space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the developers have begun to alter the lobby, not with the help of Mr. Nouvel, but of Jennifer Post, an Upper East Side interior designer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nouvel, reached at his studio in Paris, said he was sad about the changes. ''They have gone off course,'' he said of the developers. ''They want to complete the building as inexpensively as possible and they want to take the money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nouvel handed the phone to Francois Leininger, the project architect, who had just returned from New York. ''None of what they're doing is related to our design,'' Mr. Leininger said. ''We are out of the loop.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work on the lobby began when the owners removed some of its granite floor last week. The stone has been replaced with carpet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Post said she was bringing in ''three huge black boulders, rock sculptures, designed by me -- they're as big as grizzlies. And I'm adding furniture from my collection -- two seating areas, in cashmere. We're creating an environment where people are welcomed into the Nouvel building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holly Parker, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman and the building's sales director, said the goal was to ''take it to the next step of making the lobby more residential, and comfortable, when you walk in.'' Ms. Parker's listings range from a $1.45 million one-bedroom unit to a $22 million four-bedroom penthouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that she had heard, over and over, from both potential buyers and current residents, that they wanted the lobby warmed up, which she communicated to the developers. ''They interviewed a bunch of different people, and they made a decision to go with Jennifer Post,'' she said. She said that the furniture Ms. Post chose for the lobby would create a ''more residential'' feel, without disturbing Mr. Nouvel's architecture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some owners are skeptical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't want it warmed up,'' said Todd Eberle, a photographer who with his partner, Richard Pandiscio, owns a one-bedroom condo in the building. (Mr. Pandiscio also developed the marketing campaign for the building.) Their neighbor Barbara Dente, a communications executive, agrees. Ms. Dente, whose weekend house was designed by the modernist Marcel Breuer, said she wanted her Nouvel as Mr. Nouvel intended it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners were particularly dismayed that they were not consulted on the changes. They said they also could not determine whether it was the original developer, Cape Advisors, or Pembrook Capital Management that was calling the shots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Pembrook lent $47.1 million to Cape Advisors to keep the project afloat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuart J. Boesky, the chief executive of Pembrook, said he supported the lobby update. He said that he was not telling Cape Advisors what to do, but that ''they consulted with us, and we thought it was a good idea.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boesky said the real estate agents were right to report the views of potential buyers. ''I think it is appropriately their job to tell the owner what is in the best interests of selling the units,'' he said. Mr. Boesky said he was upbeat about the building's prospects. ''The market's coming back nicely, albeit not at the same price level as before,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existing lobby, Ms. Post said, is 60 feet long and ''it's nothing but a cold black hallway. We're not taking anything away from Nouvel. He's a hard-surface minimalist -- I'm adding my soft surfaces. I'm complementing his aesthetic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Boesky said, ''That building is absolutely a piece of art by Jean Nouvel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Parker added, ''We are channeling Nouvel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Nouvel, who is based in Paris, does not want to be channeled. ''What I designed was very precise,'' he said, adding, ''It's not respectful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Jeffrey S. Reich, a lawyer in Manhattan who often represents condominium buyers in lawsuits, condo owners have a right to sue if the building that is delivered is not the building they were promised. But in this case, he and his law partner, Steven D. Sladkus, said it might be hard for tenants to prove damages, unless they can show that the new lobby decreased the value of the apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its basic configuration will not change. Upon entering the lobby, visitors walk up seven stairs, then turn 90 degrees to enter a large dark space. At the top of the stairs a glass enclosure -- which some have likened to a fish tank -- hid the concierge desk, until it was removed last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now residents are waiting to see what the new version of the lobby will look like. Ms. Post is known for creating spare interiors; she once warned potential clients, ''You can't bring your 17 family photographs and your grandmother's seven dining chairs. You can keep one of each.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Parker, the broker, said she believed 9 out of 10 people in the building supported the changes, but that ''eventually the condo association will take control. And if they don't like the new furniture, they can put it in the basement.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOENIX -- <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and GMAC are firing up their formidable foreclosure machines again today, after a brief pause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But hard-pressed homeowners like Lydia Sweetland are asking why lenders often balk at a less disruptive solution: short sales, which allow owners to sell deeply devalued homes for less than what remains on their mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sweetland, 47, tried such a sale this summer out of desperation. She had lost her high-paying job and drained her once-flush retirement savings, and her bank, GMAC, wouldn't modify her mortgage. After seven months of being unable to pay her mortgage, she decided that a short sale would give her more time to move out of her Phoenix home and damage her credit rating less than a foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She owes $206,000 and found a buyer who would pay $200,000. Last Friday, GMAC rejected that offer and said it would foreclose in seven days, even though, according to Ms. Sweetland's broker, the bank estimates it will make $19,000 less on a foreclosure than on a short sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I guess I could salute and say, 'O.K., I'm walking, here's the keys,' '' says Ms. Sweetland, as she sits in a plastic Adirondack chair on her patio. ''But I need a little time, and I don't want to just leave the house vacant. I loved this neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GMAC declined to be interviewed about Ms. Sweetland's case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The halt in most foreclosures the last few weeks gave a hint of hope to homeowners like Ms. Sweetland, who found breathing room to pursue alternatives. Consumer advocates took the view that this might pressure banks to offer mortgage modifications on better terms and perhaps drive interest in short sales, which are rising sharply in many corners of the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some major lenders took a quick inventory of their foreclosure practices and insisted their processes were sound. They now seem intent on resuming foreclosures. And that could have a profound effect on many homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Arizona, thousands of homeowners have turned to short sales to avoid foreclosures, and many end up running a daunting procedural gantlet. Several of the largest lenders have set up complicated and balky application systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns about fraud are one of the reasons lenders are so careful about short sales. Sometimes well-off homeowners want to portray their finances as dire and cut their losses on a property. In other instances, distressed homeowners try to make a short sale to a relative, who would then sell it back to them (a practice that is illegal). A recent industry report estimates that short sale fraud occurs in at least 2 percent of sales and costs banks about $300 million annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales are also hindered when homeowners fail to forward the proper papers, have tax liens or cannot find a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of such concerns, homeowners often are instructed that they must be delinquent and they must apply for a modification first, even if chances of approval are slim. The aversion to short sales also leads banks to take many months to process applications, and some lenders set unrealistically high sales prices -- known as broker price opinions -- and hire workers who say they are poorly trained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, quite a few homeowners seeking short sales -- banks will not provide precise numbers -- topple into foreclosure, sometimes, critics say, for reasons that are hard to understand. Ms. Sweetland and her broker say they are confounded by her foreclosure, because in Arizona's depressed real estate market, foreclosed homes often sit vacant for many months before banks are able to resell them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Banks are historically reluctant to do short sales, fearing that somehow the homeowner is getting an advantage on them,'' said Diane E. Thompson, of counsel to the National Consumer Law Center. ''There's this irrational belief that if you foreclose and hold on to the property for six months, somehow prices will rebound.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners, advocates and realty agents offer particularly pointed criticism of <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, the nation's largest servicer of mortgages, and a recipient of billions of dollars in federal bailout aid. Its holdings account for 31 percent of the pending foreclosures in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix and Scottsdale, according to an analysis for The Arizona Republic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank instructs real estate agents to use its computer program to evaluate short sales. But in three cases observed by The New York Times in collaboration with two real estate agents, the bank's system repeatedly asked for and lost the same information and generated inaccurate responses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In half a dozen more cases examined by The New York Times, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> rejected short sale offers, foreclosed and auctioned off houses at lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I hear that a client's mortgage is held by <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, I just sigh. Our chances of getting an approval for them just went from 90 percent to 50-50,'' said Benjamin Toma, who has a family-run real estate agency in Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> officials also declined interview requests. A <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> spokeswoman said in an e-mail that the bank had processed 61,000 short sales nationwide this year; she declined to provide numbers for Arizona or to discuss criticisms of the company's processing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, the mortgage finance company with federal backing, gives cash incentives to encourage servicers, who are affiliated with banks and who oversee great bundles of delinquent mortgages, to approve short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But less obvious financial incentives can push toward a foreclosure rather than a short sale. Servicers can reap high fees from foreclosures. And lenders can try to collect on private mortgage insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some advocates and real estate agents also point to an April 2009 regulatory change in an obscure federal accounting law. The change, in effect, allowed banks to foreclose on a home without having to write down a loss until that home was sold. By contrast, if a bank agrees to a short sale, it must mark the loss immediately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales, to be sure, are no free ride for homeowners. They take a hit to their credit ratings, although for three to five years rather than seven after a foreclosure. An owner seeking a short sale must satisfy a laundry list of conditions, including making a detailed disclosure of income, tax and credit liens. And owners must prove that they have no connection to the buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, bank decision-making, at least from a homeowner's perspective, often appears arbitrary. That is certainly the view of Nicholas Yannuzzi, who after 30 years in Arizona still talks with a Philadelphia rasp. Mr. Yannuzzi has owned five houses over time, without any financial problems. When his wife was diagnosed with bone cancer, he put 20 percent down and bought a ranch house in North Scottsdale so that she would not have to climb stairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last few years, his wife died, he lost his job and he used his retirement fund to pay his mortgage for five months. His bank, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, denied his mortgage modification request and then his request for a short sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank officer told him that <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, which held the mortgage, would not take a discount. At the end of last week, he was waiting to be locked out of his home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm a proud man. I've worked since I was 20 years old,'' he said. ''But I've run out of my 79 weeks of unemployment, so that's it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He shrugged. ''I try to keep in the frame of mind that a lot of people have it worse than me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in Phoenix, Ms. Sweetland's real estate agent, Sherry Rampy, appeared to receive good news last week. GMAC re-examined her client's application and suggested it might be approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the bank attached a condition: Ms. Sweetland must come up with $2,000 in closing costs or pay $100 a month for 50 months to the bank. Ms. Sweetland, however, is flat broke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A late afternoon desert sun angles across her Pasadena neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After this, I'll never buy again,'' Ms. Sweetland says. ''This is not the American dream. This is not my American dream.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORKERS have been rediscovering a small neighborhood in Brooklyn called the Columbia Street Waterfront District -- and so have the real estate developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opening of Pier 6 in Brooklyn Bridge Park last spring, and the recent completion of a bicycle and pedestrian pathway along Columbia Street, part of the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway that will link north and south Brooklyn, have drawn visitors to the waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There, home buyers and renters will find a mix of row houses, urban renewal buildings, and a growing stock of new and recently developed condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A slice of about two dozen square blocks, cut off from the rest of the borough by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, the Columbia waterfront has been seen as an up-and-coming neighborhood. But development has come in fits and starts because of its location, the forbidding warehouses and piers that block harbor access, and a lack of subway lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This particular location -- we've liked it since Day 1,'' said Louis V. Greco, the general manager of the development company SDS, which bought two parcels in the neighborhood in 2008. ''That's because of the views of Lower Manhattan, obviously, and there's just so much going on down there now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late September, SDS began marketing a development with 37 condominiums on one of those parcels, called 100 Congress. Because of the recession's pressure, the developer had planned to sell the other parcel, at the corner of Columbia and Warren Streets, but recently decided not to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a market out there again,'' he said. The second development will have only 12 apartments, and all but one will be three-bedrooms. Mr. Greco said the interest thus far in 100 Congress, where nearly half the units are three-bedrooms, has been from families. Other real estate agents in the Columbia waterfront area said they too had noticed its growing appeal to young families. Almost the entire neighborhood falls into the zones for Public Schools 29 and 58, which are both highly regarded. There are also organizations that offer children's programs, along with a series of small parks and playgrounds, including the popular one at Pier 6, which has 1.6 acres of play areas and a ''water lab.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When my family first moved to the area in 2005, there was a big kind of hipster element to it,'' said Tina Fallon, an agent with the brokerage Realty Collective, whose office is on Columbia Street. ''What we're seeing now is an increasing number of people who are interested in what are called family-size apartments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Brooklyn Bridge Park, a 449-unit condominium complex just north of the district, has also helped raise the profile of the area, particularly by helping to subsidize park construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Galeano, a local real estate broker, built a small development with three apartments at 82 Union Street a year ago and units rented quickly, he said. ''The market is back quite a bit,'' Mr. Galeano said, estimating that a two-bedroom apartment rents on average for about $2,200 a month. ''It's not quite the level it was before the recession, but we're seeing a lot of activity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with 100 Congress, several other projects are coming to fruition. Columbia Commons, at 110 Warren Street, is the largest, with 42 condos, and in the beginning of October, after four months on the market, about half its units were under contract, according to Halstead Property Development Marketing, which is handling the listing. Prices for the remaining apartments ranged from $420,000 to $685,000 for one- and two-bedrooms; the remaining three-bedroom is listed for $935,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most prolific Columbia waterfront developers, Marshall Sohne, pulled his plans for a 10-story tower at 211-213 Columbia Street and instead plans to build eight experimental green condominiums and four mews houses. While he was prepared to finance the project himself, he said, bankers showed unexpected faith in the market. ''We're going to get bank financing, which I'm surprised at,'' Mr. Sohne said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another developer, Barrett Design and Development, is converting a former macaroni factory at 25 Carroll Street into 17 condominiums, and principals are confident enough in the market to sell from plans, with only one model unit, said Lindsay Barton Barrett, a broker at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Barrett said that Barrett Design, founded by her husband, Alex, has completed five other developments, all of them in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood from which the Columbia waterfront was sliced. Since June 2009, ''the market's been very strong'' in Carroll Gardens, Ms. Barrett said. ''It just largely has been a function of there being very little supply.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Barrett said that she hoped market strength would extend to the Columbia waterfront, where prices historically have been lower -- in recent years, about 20 percent -- and that 25 Carroll Street would be priced accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greco says price difference is minimized when a development is on a street like Congress that crosses over the expressway. At 100 Congress, SDS did ultimately decide to develop less-expensive three-bedroom apartments than first envisioned in 2008, but prices are still comparable to similar properties in Cobble Hill, Mr. Greco said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-bedrooms range from $350,000 to $390,000; two-bedrooms, $620,000 to $750,000; the range for three-bedrooms is $825,000 to $925,000; and there is one penthouse for $1.5 million, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Fallon says one of the biggest changes she's noticed is that she no longer has to sell the neighborhood to buyers as a low-cost alternative to Carroll Gardens and Cobble Hill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing people in our real estate work who say, 'I want to be on this side of the B.Q.E.,' '' Ms. Fallon said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR some New Yorkers on the hunt for an apartment, the must-have item in the search is nothing as prosaic as a walk-in closet or a second bathroom. It is a number -- a lucky number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could be the number of the apartment or the floor, or the closing date, or the precise amount of the final bid. And these buyers are happy to pay a premium or forgo a better apartment just to get that number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numerology of real estate seems to depend on cultural background and belief systems. Jewish buyers may favor the number 18, because it is the numerical equivalent for chai, or life. But for Chinese buyers, the number eight may rule, because it is a homophone for the word for prosperity. And Indians who follow Vedic astrology have a personal lucky number based on birth date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Willis and Emily Loughhead, who are in contract to buy a one-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side, based their lucky number on a system of their own invention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's nondenominational,'' said Mr. Loughhead, who is the executive chef at the Plaza Hotel, ''and it has nothing to do with anything. It's just good luck to us.'' Their number is 19, because Mr. Loughhead was born on April 19; Mrs. Loughhead, who is a pastry assistant at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, was born on Feb. 19; they unintentionally had their first date on Aug. 19, 2006; and then intentionally married on Sept. 19, 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also see the number in unexpected ways. When they went to get a cat from an animal shelter, the one they chose happened to come out of Box 19, and when they went to a baseball game this summer, they ended up in Section 19. ''It's amazing how much it shows up in our lives,'' Mr. Loughhead said. ''If there are so many coincidences, it's not a coincidence anymore. This is a lucky number, and it's important to us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Loughhead said that because she is Chinese-American, she has always been aware of the luck of numbers. When they started their apartment search, they were not bound by the number eight, but she wanted to avoid the fourth floor, because the Chinese word for four sounds like the word for death. Still, their main objective was to find a one-bedroom that they could afford and that had good light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their agent, Stephanie Rappoport-Wahlgren of Brown Harris Stevens, and other brokers say that numeric requests can sometimes add to their workload but that for the most part it is easy enough to get all parties to go along with a numerical imperative. ''It all falls under 'The things we do to sell real estate,' '' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Loughhead was the first to see the apartment they are now in contract for. It is smaller than they had hoped for, but because it is on the top floor, ''you look out and get pure sky and light,'' she said. ''When I walked in, it just felt right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Loughhead's parents gave the apartment their approval, because it is on the sixth floor and the number six sounds like the Chinese word for wealth. Then Mr. Loughhead took charge of the bidding process, which went through several rounds and involved two other potential buyers. Each bid he submitted included the number 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their final bid, which they declined to share, included a 19, as well as a 9, for the year they were married; a 4, for his birth month; and a 2, for her birth month. When Ms. Rappoport-Wahlgren relayed the tale of the numbers to the sellers, they told her that, like Mr. Loughhead, their twins had been born on April 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't make this stuff up,'' Ms. Rappoport-Wahlgren said. ''Then the sellers felt like this was meant to be, and it was a happy moment for both sides.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Loughhead feels certain that their lucky number helped them get the apartment. ''They had a cash bid that was higher than ours,'' he said. ''If we hadn't told them about the number, there wouldn't have been that connection with the owners.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Roberts, an agent at Halstead Property, also focused on numbers in her bid for the one-bedroom apartment she bought on the Upper West Side in 2002. The unit was listed at $495,000, and there were multiple bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Roberts, who is Jewish, said that whenever she made a donation she always gave a multiple of 18 because of the number's association with chai. So if a minimum suggested donation is $25, for example, she will write a check for $36.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She considered bidding $513,000, which was $18,000 above the asking price, but she ultimately bid $518,000 and got the apartment. ''I met the owner and I raved about the way he had redone the kitchen,'' she said. ''So in the end, I don't know if I was the best qualified, or if he took a liking to me because I liked his kitchen, or if it was the number 18. Whatever it was, it worked.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some buyers of Indian ancestry, Vedic astrology, which is based on ancient texts and the lunar calendar, helps dictate real estate decisions. Using a person's birth date, Vedic astrologers create charts to determine a lucky number and provide propitious dates for major events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Lou Currier, an agent with Century 21 NY Metro, said a client who bought a one-bedroom condo on the East Side last month was adamant that the deal close on Sept. 16, ''because his parents are Hindu and very religious, and they were quite set on that date.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Sept. 16 was just a few days away, Ms. Currier recalled, and the seller and the lawyers were happy to comply, but the management company said it would need an extra $500 to expedite the closing. The number was important enough, she said, that her client paid the fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Danica Cordell-Reeh, an agent with Halstead Property, said an Indian couple from New Jersey had introduced her to both Vedic astrology and Vastu, a design code similar to feng shui that guides the shape and orientation of buildings and rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, Aaditi and Avinash Lele, are looking to buy a one-bedroom apartment as an investment and potential pied-a-terre. Vastu dictates that a front door face either east or north but not south. What's more, Aaditi Lele said, an astrologer has determined that as a couple she and her husband have seven as a lucky number and eight as an unlucky number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unit number is the focus of their numerical goal: If an apartment has both a number and a letter, then the letter must be added to the number, so 3D would become 3 plus 4 (D being the fourth letter of the alphabet), or 7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cordell-Reeh says that since the Leles explained these requirements to her, she screens every potential apartment for its number, using a chart that she created assigning a number to every letter in the alphabet, and then she scrutinizes floor plans to make sure front doors don't face south. ''It really doesn't take that much extra work,'' she said, ''because most of the information is there and available.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Lele said that Vedic astrology had not guided her past real estate decisions. ''I didn't get involved with it because there are so many dos and don'ts,'' she said. ''But my current house has the number eight, and I don't know if there's anything to it, but my husband has had some tough times at work since we have lived here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is perhaps no better testament to the melting pot that is New York City than a couple whom Silvette Julian, a vice president of Nest Seekers International, recently helped place in a high-rise in Long Island City, Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, Abhishek and Sugandh Agrawal, are Indian and follow certain aspects of Vastu, but also decided to be guided by Chinese numerology. Sugandh Agrawal said she researched online and decided that she wanted an apartment number that added up to either six or eight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even though we have something similar in Hindu, we followed that instead,'' Abhishek Agrawal said. ''We felt that if we were going to go for something that will be our own, we should look at all the aspects.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Julian said the couple initially fell in love with a three-bedroom apartment with the number 1705. But those digits add up to the number 13, which in turn adds up to the number 4. ''Either as the number 13 or the number 4, that was an absolute no,'' Ms. Agrawal said. ''Four is considered inauspicious in Chinese and Indian culture as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only other unit available with the same layout was seven floors lower -- Apartment 1005, which the Agrawals bought and moved into two months ago, because 1005 adds up to six. ''It was definitely a better view on the 17th floor,'' Ms. Agrawal said. ''But I feel better, mentally more at peace here, because when you have even a little bit of doubt in your mind, then you might keep thinking that the house is not right for you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer of the building, TF Cornerstone, makes it a practice not to give anything it builds a 13th floor, something that is common in countries where the number is considered unlucky. Instead, many residential and commercial buildings skip from the 12th to the 14th floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We do our own construction,'' said Sofia Estevez, an executive vice president of TF Cornerstone, ''and when we're building, we have a 13th floor so that workers don't get confused. But that changes when the building is done. Why borrow trouble? If people are going to feel uncomfortable about it, we don't need to deal with it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For similar reasons, she said, in the Agrawals' building the company recently decided to change Unit 911 to 912. ''Every time I saw 911, I thought of Sept. 11,'' Ms. Estevez said. ''So I felt we should retire the number out of respect for the victims of Sept. 11.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sally Faubion, a numerologist in San Francisco who also works with clients here in New York City, said she advised people not to obsess about house or apartment numbers. ''If you get in a place that feels right and the numbers work too, that's great,'' she said. ''But if the numbers don't work perfectly, it can still be a good experience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, she has written a newsletter that addresses the importance of house and apartment numbers. ''There are some numbers that are very beneficial on a house or apartment,'' she said. ''So whether you believe it or not, why not stack the cards in your favor?''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GIVE my house to my children while I'm still alive? You must be kidding!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that's your sentiment, you have plenty of company. But the alternative could be to leave your heirs a hefty estate tax bill on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the estate tax lapsed for one year on Jan. 1, it is scheduled to come back next year with a vengeance. Unless Congress changes current law, the estate tax rate will be 55 percent (60 percent in some cases) on all but the first $1 million, except for what you bequeath to your spouse or charity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By shifting real estate now, you remove the asset and any subsequent increase in its value from your estate -- an especially timely move if your property's value is depressed and you expect it to bounce back at some point. What's more, if you wind up owing tax on the gift, the rate now is less than it may be later. Barring Congressional action, the tax rate for 2010 is 35 percent, rising to 55 percent on Jan. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shifting ownership of a home makes sense even for people who are only moderately wealthy, said Lawrence P. Katzenstein, a lawyer with Thompson Coburn in St. Louis. For example, a widow with a co-op apartment worth $2 million and marketable securities totaling $3 million might not want to give away investment assets -- she needs to live on the income. By transferring her apartment (if the co-op rules allow it) she can reap a substantial estate tax savings without disturbing her investment portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the biggest hurdle, though, is the awkwardness of having business relationships with family members, said Natalie B. Choate, a Boston lawyer and author of ''The QPRT Manual: The Estate Planner's Guide to Qualified Personal Residence Trusts.'' If you want to keep living in the house, you must pay fair-market rent to the family members or an entity (like a trust) that becomes the owner. Awkward though this might be, it's a smart estate tax move, because the rent then is a way of giving money to your family without having to pay gift tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You should familiarize yourself with these gift-tax rules: You are allowed to give up to $13,000 a year to each of as many people as you like; spouses can combine this annual exclusion to give jointly $26,000 to each of as many people as they like. On top of this, you can make total lifetime gifts of up to $1 million before any tax applies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You will probably want to reduce the value of any real estate you give away, to stay within the legal limits and minimize any gift tax you owe. Here are four strategies to consider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GIVE PARTIAL INTERESTS You can make gifts of shares all at once (for example, by giving various people an interest in the same property) or over time (if there is only one recipient). Because the recipient is yoked together with other interest holders and can't act unilaterally, the value of what's transferred can be discounted by about 15 percent, lawyers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This approach can work well, for example, if you and your spouse bought an inexpensive place for your son to live in while he was in college and he plans to stay on after graduation. Through a series of combined annual exclusion gifts worth $26,000, the two of you can gradually make him the owner of the property without having to pay gift tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You must get a professional appraisal at the time you make the first transfer, with follow-up appraisals if the value of the property has changed when you make subsequent gifts. If you make an annual exclusion gift in December for one year and another in January for the next, you can rely on the same appraisal for both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USE A GRANTOR TRUST If you want to benefit various people but don't want to become involved in any squabbles that arise among them, make your gifts to a trust that will benefit all of them and choose a trustee to oversee the property management. This should be structured as a grantor trust, meaning that the person who sets it up retains certain rights or powers, said Michael D. Mulligan, a lawyer with Lewis, Rice &amp; Fingersh in St. Louis. Why? A grantor trust is not treated as a separate taxable entity, so there's no income tax on the rent you pay. Here, too, you can discount the value of your gift by transferring partial interests, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One caveat this year is that you should not put assets into a trust that will benefit grandchildren, Mr. Mulligan said. The reason is complicated: right now there is no generation-skipping transfer tax and no exemption from that tax, either (though, like the estate tax, those provisions spring back next year). So it's possible that financing such a trust in 2010 could cause all the trust assets, including appreciation, to be taxed when they are withdrawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This an important pitfall to keep in mind, but as a practical matter most clients thinking about transferring real estate are likely to be concerned with benefiting adult children, rather than grandchildren, Mr. Mulligan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CREATE A QPRT With the Qualified Personal Residence Trust, known as a QPRT (pronounced CUE-pert), you put your primary residence or vacation home into an irrevocable trust, retaining the right to live there rent-free for a specified number of years. During that period, the trust, of which you could be trustee, owns the property. If you survive the preset period -- a condition for this technique to work-- ownership can then pass to the beneficiaries, usually children, or go into another trust, often called a dropdown trust, for the rest of your life (you would then need to pay rent if you want to live there).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The taxable gift with a QPRT reflects the value of the right to acquire the personal residence a certain number of years from when it is set up, discounted by the probability that the person setting up the trust will live that long. Figuring the discount involves a complex actuarial calculation based on the Section 7520 rate set each month by the Internal Revenue Service. The higher the rate and the longer the term, the bigger the discount and the more savings associated with the QPRT, said Mr. Katzenstein, whose Tiger Tables Actuarial Software (www.tigertables.com[http://www.tigertables.com]) does such computations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when interest rates are low, as they are now, QPRTs can work well for elderly people, because the discount goes up as life expectancy gets shorter, he said. For example, if a 70-year-old put a $2 million home into a five-year QPRT this month or next month, when the Section 7520 rate is 2 percent, the value of the gift would be $1,563,620, Mr. Katzenstein said. If an 80-year-old entered into the same arrangement, the value of the gift would be $1,228,740.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CREATE A LEGAL ENTITY For family vacation homes that you expect to be shared, Wendy S. Goffe, a lawyer with Graham &amp; Dunn in Seattle, recommends that you put the real estate into an entity like a limited liability company. (For tax reasons, property should not be placed in a corporation.) Then you can gradually give away shares in the enterprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This, too, can achieve valuation discounts, but is preferable to a trust in various respects, Ms. Goffe said. Most notably, it provides for smoother transitions of ownership and management -- something you ought to address in an operating agreement. One important issue to cover is the procedure for selling or transferring ownership interests if, for any reason, a family member wants out.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May 2008, a few months before the financial industry's meltdown, the shipping executive Vasilis Bacolitsas signed up to buy a $3.4 million apartment at the Brompton, a luxury condominium tower being built on the Upper East Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building went up as the real estate market went down, and Mr. Bacolitsas and his wife sought a $600,000 reduction in the purchase price. When they did not get it, they decided they did not want the apartment anymore. Their contract, like virtually all real estate contracts, required that they surrender the $510,000 deposit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last month, a judge ruled that the couple could walk away with their money. It was one of a series of recent rulings in New York and other states that have enraged developers and given an escape hatch to buyers who signed contracts at the worst possible time, before one of the biggest real estate meltdowns in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyers -- some wealthy, some not -- are successfully using a 1968 federal law intended to protect buyers of out-of-state land from unscrupulous developers or brokers. But in many of these cases, the properties have been built as advertised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, lawyers for the buyers are finding fault in wording that technically violates the law in contracts or other paperwork -- language that few developers or lawyers paid much attention to during the long real estate boom. Lawyers have won back deposits for errors as simple as failing to give buyers a legal description of the property or to register the building with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a basic requirement that many companies nonetheless overlooked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The statute was never designed for purchasers of luxury condominiums in urban areas to get out of contracts because of changes in the economy,'' said Bruce H. Lederman, a lawyer defending developers in two such cases out of Long Island City, Queens. ''It was designed to protect unsophisticated out-of-state purchasers like Jackie Gleason in 'The Honeymooners' from Florida swampland schemes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lawyers who represent buyers argue that this use of the law legitimately helps people who, because of changing conditions, conclude that buying such an apartment is no longer advisable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The crash of the market resulted in people losing their jobs, No. 1, and No. 2, the tightening of the credit market meant they couldn't get the loans they needed to buy the property,'' said Adam Leitman Bailey, who represented Mr. Bacolitsas and a number of other buyers in cases involving the law, known as the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, or ILSA. ''We had to find some law to help these people, and that's what ILSA did. Desperation inspired creativity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, a federal appeals court reinstated a lawsuit filed by eight buyers who had deposited $25,000 to $80,000 on new homes in Falls Church, Va., ruling that the wording of the developer's contracts did not comply with the law. Two decisions over the summer in Florida -- including one allowing a New Jersey couple to win back a $50,000 deposit on a townhouse in Port St. Lucie -- favored buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled in favor of three buyers who had placed about $300,000, combined, in down payments for apartments at 111 Fulton Street, a building known as the District. Late last month, Judge Paul A. Crotty of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that two buyers of a condominium conversion at 20 Pine Street may get their deposits back if they can prove that they would have pulled out earlier had the developer informed them about their rights under ILSA, according to the buyers' lawyer, Lawrence Weiner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Bacolitsas's case, the court ruled that his contract violated the law because it stated that the contract could not be filed with the city register, where property transactions are recorded. The law requires contracts to be recordable in city or county registries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Walfish, a lawyer representing the developer in that case, the Related Companies, said it would appeal. The apartment in question sold in April for $2.8 million -- $600,000 less than the original price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers on both sides said that if the ruling stood, it could open the floodgates to more buyer lawsuits because many contracts contained similar language. In New York, typically, only actual sales -- in the form of deeds or co-op stock transfers -- are recorded, not contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The phone is ringing off the hook,'' said Mr. Bailey, who represented Mr. Bacolitsas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ILSA law came about in response to the midcentury land boom in states like Florida and Arizona. Developers and brokers in boiler rooms not unlike the office depicted in the David Mamet play ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' would market properties, sight unseen, to Northern buyers. President Lyndon B. Johnson told Congress in 1967 that he hoped the legislation would ''give our investors better protection in their purchases of undeveloped land.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its name, the law applies to properties in the same state and city, too. It generally lets buyers cancel their contracts within two years and sue within three years if the contract does not include specific legal language. Developers can avoid the law's requirements if they complete their projects in two years and are building fewer than 100 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert M. Chasnow, a partner at <span class="companylink">Holland &amp; Knight</span> who has been advising developers on ILSA for 30 years, said that, at first, courts were not receptive to buyers' claims. Nationwide, until the last couple of years, roughly 10 to 20 ILSA court decisions came out per year, he said, but last year there were 69, and there have been 50 this year. ''There's been an explosion of ILSA cases,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, an analysis by The Real Deal, a New York real estate publication, found that buyers of at least 131 New York City condominium apartments worth $132 million were seeking to use ILSA to back out of their deals. A couple of early decisions favored developers, but more recent rulings in New York have sided with buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers have settled out of court, often with a confidentiality clause preventing buyers from discussing the agreement. Rebecca Schlanger, 34, who had used her life savings for a down payment on a $515,000 two-bedroom apartment in Miami, is suing under the law to get her money back. She said she could not obtain a mortgage because the developer had not purchased flood insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I did everything right,'' Ms. Schlanger said. ''I saved my money. I did my due diligence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But like many buyers before the bust, she did not have a contingency clause in her contract that allowed her to back out if she could not obtain a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Cooper, who represents Ms. Schlanger and 17 other buyers in the Miami building, said that she had grounds to sue under ILSA because the developer did not include a legal description of the unit in the contract. Mr. Cooper said the developer also made misrepresentations about Ms. Schlanger's ability to resell the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aslan Palachi, the developer of the Miami building, known as the 1800 Club, said he had no plans to settle Ms. Schlanger's case. He said her claims were ''unfounded.'' He added, ''We have met every requirement'' of ILSA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When the project was completed and the time came to close, they discovered it was not as good an investment,'' he said. ''They tried to find every possible way to get out of their contracts.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Manhattan's newest skyscrapers is rising on a nondescript corner of the Avenue of the Americas and 32nd Street. In coming months, the building, once called Tower 111 and now tentatively renamed the Continental, will begin marketing its 338 rental units. Its developer is hoping that sweeping views of the Empire State Building, nine-foot ceilings and amenities that include an indoor swimming pool will draw renters to this mostly commercial stretch of the Garment District.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Continental isn't the only new development in the area. There are three large projects on this stretch of Avenue of the Americas, from 32nd Street to 29th Street. Each has met a different fate, and their stories tell a tale of real estate's slow, jagged recovery from the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 53-story Continental, at 885 Avenue of the Americas, was nearly undone by the slumping economy, and only a cost-savings agreement with the construction trade unions saved the tower. The owners of a site one block to the south, at 855 Avenue of the Americas, were not as fortunate: a vacant lot attests to a residential development that never got off the ground. Another developer recently bought the mortgage on the land, and is now angling to take control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just to the south of that site, at 835 Avenue of the Americas, is the Beatrice, a limestone-and-glass rental and hotel building that recently opened. The tower was far enough along when the market crashed that it emerged from the downturn relatively unscathed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This neighborhood doesn't really have a name or a clear identity, but it continues to grow,'' said Richard V. Hamilton, a senior vice president of Halstead Property who specializes in the neighborhood. ''It's appealing to some because it is so central, with Broadway plays just 10 blocks to the north, Chelsea to the south, nightlife and shopping relatively accessible, and then there is great transportation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Continental, at the southern tip of Herald Square, is the newest addition. It is still under scaffolding, and the builder, Atlantic Realty Development of New Jersey, has yet to complete many details, including the building's name and its rent roll. The first tenants will most likely move into the building this spring, said Clifford Finn, the director of new development marketing at Citi Habitats, the brokerage that is representing the rentals. The mix of studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments, which start on the 10th floor, will have a starting rent of about $2,500 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the rental part of the development, there is a three-floor, 38,000-square-foot retail space. With its location across from the Manhattan Mall, the developers are hoping for a big-box tenant. The outdoor gear retailer REI was close to signing a lease when it chose instead to move to the Puck Building in SoHo, said Benjamin Fox, the president of the Winick Realty Group, which is representing the space. A gym is now considering the space, while TD Bank and Duane Reade have also looked. The asking rents range from $125 a square foot to more than $300 a square foot. Retail rents on nearby West 34th Street command an average of $500 a square foot, according to the Real Estate Board of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Continental was almost never built. When the market downturn hit, said Alan Schall, a senior executive at Atlantic Realty and the project manager of the Continental, ''we slowed construction, and there was definitely some contemplation about stopping.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction trade unions saw the difficulty that builders like Atlantic Realty Development were experiencing. ''When we realized that many projects were being put on hold, that everything was coming to a stop, we called an emergency meeting,'' said Louis J. Coletti, president and chief executive of the Building Trades Employers' Association, which represents some 1,700 construction managers, general contractors and subcontractors in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008 the group, along with the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, began negotiations among the unions, culminating in what it calls the Economic Recovery Project Labor Agreement. The agreement, which was instituted last year and comes up for renewal in March, requires that members lower their profit margins, work more efficiently and take other austerity measures to help make development projects more economical in the downturn. Developers must fill out an application showing their financial duress, and the level of savings is need-based.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Continental was one of the first projects to take advantage of the agreement. ''We had a big role in getting that agreement done,'' said Mr. Schall, who declined to detail how much savings the project received. ''The savings were significant, and it's safe to say we wouldn't have built without it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners of the land directly to the south of the Continental were not so fortunate. The Chetrit Group and Tessler Developments acquired the parcel, between 30th and 31st Streets, in 2007, taking out a $105.3 million mortgage. The plan called for a 37-story tower that would include retail space, more than 10 floors of offices, a parking garage and residential condominiums. Like the Continental, it would be designed by the architect Costas Kondylis. But with the real estate market crashing around them, the developers never broke ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Durst Fetner, a partnership of the Durst Organization and Sidney Fetner Associates, acquired the mortgage for an undisclosed sum from the troubled lender <span class="companylink">iStar Financial</span>, which took over the loan when it acquired <span class="companylink">Fremont Investment &amp; Loan</span> in 2007. IStar is now struggling with nearly $9 billion in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City records do not show any foreclosure proceedings, so experts in real estate turnarounds say it is likely that Durst Fetner is negotiating to take control of the land through a deed in lieu of foreclosure, or some other private deal. Both parties declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The timing of this project is good,'' said Mark S. Edelstein, a partner in the real estate workout group at the law firm <span class="companylink">Morrison &amp; Foerster</span>. ''Even if Durst Fetner spends the next 10 to 15 months foreclosing, they will still take title towards the bottom of the market, in an area that is ripe for future development.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In stark contrast to the vacant lot is the recently opened Beatrice. The mixed-use project is typical of developments that were popular during the market boom -- complex to build, with many features and amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the base is a retail space featuring FoodParc, a food court by the restaurateurs Jeffrey Chodorow and Ed Schoenfeld. The first 24 floors make up the 292-room Eventi Hotel, which opened in May. Above the Eventi are 301 rental apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental component, known as the Beatrice, has a separate entrance on 29th Street, a fitness center and private sky lounge, floor-to-ceiling windows and washers and dryers. It is 40 percent rented, said Mr. Finn of Citi Habitats, which is also the leasing agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rentals start at $2,775 for studios, $3,875 for one-bedrooms and $6,150 for two-bedrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The timing of the project was such that ''by the time we began feeling the pinch we were already far along in the building process,'' said Evan Stein, the president of JD Carlisle Development Corporation. The company bought the land, once a two-story parking garage, in early 2005 and broke ground in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, the company did reach out to the unions to partake in the same project labor agreement that the Continental benefited from, but because the project's fate was not so dire, savings were minimal, Mr. Stein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Beatrice is clearly a product of the real estate boom, said James P. Stuckey, a divisional dean of the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University. ''If done today,'' he said, ''it would have a substantially harder time getting financing because of its complexities.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a column on Tuesday, I discuss legal arguments regarding whether MERS -- Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems Inc. -- has violated state real estate laws, and note a couple of cases where rulings have gone against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those cases, in Oregon, may prove to be a classic example of how a single person can affect the legal system. The case was filed by Natache D. Rinegard-Guirma, a homeowner in Portland who is way behind in mortgage payments. She is acting as her own lawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judge Garr M. King issued an injunction in United States District Court blocking the foreclosure of Ms. Rinegard-Guirma's home, saying she was likely to prevail in her argument that the basic structure of MERS violates Oregon law and renders the mortgage invalid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her complaint, she sees a conspiracy to drive her out of her home, and says actions of the defendants have caused her to suffer "nausea, headaches, sleeplessness, skin rashes and depression," for which she was treated at the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine. She says efforts to negotiate a loan modification were rebuffed, despite proof she could not afford the monthly payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the judge, the mortgage on her home was sold to one of the more troubled subprime mortgage securitizations, GSAMP Trust 2006-HE5, a <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> deal. Under the law, the sale of the mortgage would have had to take place in 2006, around the time the securitization trust was created. The company that arranged the mortgage, <span class="companylink">Mortgage Lenders Network USA Inc</span>., has gone out of business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That securitization has only eight loans from Oregon, which makes it relatively easy to spot the loan to Ms. Rinegard-Guirma. According to the September monthly report of the trust, her loan had a principal of $382,500 when it was made, was for 90 percent of the appraised valuation and now carries an interest rate of 9.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her first payment was made on Aug. 1, 2006, and the last on Sept. 1, 2007. She seems to have made 13 monthly payments, which together cut the principal by less than $100 a month, to $381,309.81. Since then, she has missed 34 monthly payments, and owes $99,000.87 in back interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the complaints about MERS is that financial institutions who register loans with it can get their own employees designated as MERS vice presidents. It struck me that, according to at least one news report, Mortgage Lenders Network halted operations on Jan. 3, 2007, as the subprime market was imploding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oregon judge reports that "on April 15, 2008, at 4:56 a.m., Marti Noriega, acting as vice president for 'Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems Inc. as nominee in favor of <span class="companylink">Mortgage Lenders Network USA Inc</span>.' signed as assignment of Deed of Trust" conveying the mortgage to LaSalle National Bank, the trustee of the mortgage trust. (LaSalle is now part of <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That date is more than six months after the last payment on the mortgage. Mortgage Lenders Network had halted operations 15 months earlier, yet still was able to have someone act as its nominee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note the time, before 5 a.m. According to the trust report, it began foreclosure proceedings in April 2008. Is it possible that the proceedings began the same day the deed was assigned?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The column includes excerpts from e-mails sent to me by Karmela Lejarde, a spokeswoman for MERS. But it does not include the full e-mails, which I print here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first e-mail came in response to my request for a comment on the article by Christopher L. Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah. Ms. Lejarde's reply reads:Every single court challenge to the standing of MERS in the foreclosure process has been upheld, either in the initial court proceeding or upon appeal, when proper evidence is presented before the court. Prof. Peterson's assertion that "virtually any company can show up, claim to own the note, and proceed to foreclose," is false. Foreclosure is a terrible thing for homeowners but none of the confusion surrounding erroneous foreclosures can be ascribed to MERS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERS does not create a defect in the mortgage or deed of trust. Claims that MERS disrupts or creates a defect in the mortgage or deed of trust are not supported by fact or legal precedents. This argument is often used as a tactic by lawyers to delay or prevent the foreclosure. The mortgage lien is granted to MERS by the borrower and the seller at closing and that is what makes MERS the mortgagee. The role of mortgagee is legal and binding and confers to MERS certain legal rights and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERS does not initiate foreclosure proceedings; it is the lender that initiates the proceeding. Similarly, certifying officers are designated by lending institutions and are allowed to execute only certain documents on behalf of MERS. Certifying officers selected by their employer are expected to fully comply with the policies of the lending institution for which they work, as well as MERS guidelines and all applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding the recording issue that was raised several times in the report, MERS fully complies with all recording statutes. The purpose of recording laws is to show that a lien exists, which protects the mortgagee and any bona fide purchasers. When MERS is the mortgagee, the mortgage or deed of trust is recorded, and all recording fees are paid. As for the fees themselves, these are local fees for service; if no service is needed or requested, no fee is appropriate. Additionally, any costs savings on fees are passed on to consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERS does not remove, omit, or otherwise fail to report land ownership information from public records and the trail of ownership does not change because of MERS. Parties are put on notice that MERS is the mortgagee and notifications by third parties can be sent to MERS. Mortgages and deeds of trust still get recorded in the land records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MERS System tracks the changes in servicing rights and beneficial ownership. No legal interests are transferred on the MERS System, including servicing and ownership. In fact, MERS is the only publicly available comprehensive source for note ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this information is tracked through the MERS System, the paperwork still exists to prove that actual legal transfers occurred. No mortgage ownership documents have disappeared because loans were registered on the MERS System. These documents exist now as they have before MERS was created.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We hope this helps clear up some of the confusion on these issues.In response, I asked Ms. Lejarde, the MERS spokeswoman, how the Arkansas Supreme Court ruling squared with the statement that "Every single court challenge to the standing of MERS in the foreclosure process has been upheld, either in the initial court proceeding or upon appeal, when proper evidence is presented before the court."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She replied:That particular case was not about foreclosures. The Arkansas Supreme Court held in Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. v. Southwest, 2009 WL 723182 (March 19, 2009) that even though the deed of trust specifies MERS as the beneficiary, Pulaski Mortgage Company, Inc. as the lender on the deed of trust, was the beneficiary, because Pulaski "receives payment on the debt." This finding in the opinion misconstrues the legal rights afforded a beneficiary under a deed of trust and presupposes that the beneficiary of a deed of trust is the legal equivalent to a party receiving payments under a promissory note. The court failed to offer any legal support for its finding that Pulaski was the beneficiary because at one point it received payment on the debt. It has been established in other jurisdictions that a beneficiary named in the deed of trust is granted a security interest in the subject real estate and must be receive notice., See, e.g., Schmidt v. Langal, 874 P.2d 447 (Colo. App.1993), Monterey S.P. Partnership v. W.L. Bangham, Inc. 49 Cal.3d 454, 777 P.2d 623 (1989), In re Trustee's Sale of the Real Property of Upton, 102 Wn.App. 220, 6 P.3d 1231 (2000); Brand v. <span class="companylink">First Federal Savings &amp; Loan</span> Ass'n of Fairbanks, 478 P.2d 829 (Alaska 1970); Lohr v. Cobur Corp., 654 S.W.2d 883, 885 (Mo. 1983); Wylie v. Patton, 111 Idaho 61, 720 P.2d 649 (1986); Kenly v. Miracle Properties, 412 F.Supp. 1072, 1075 (D. Ariz. 1976). All parties to the deed of trust, the contract governing this transaction, agreed that MERS, as beneficiary, acquired a security interest in the underlying real property. The Court's finding that Pulaski is the beneficiary is in direct contravention to long standing Arkansas law that it is the duty of the court to construe a contract according to the unambiguous language without enlarging or extending its terms. North v. Philliber, 269 Ark. 403, 602 S.W.2d 643 (1980). The United States Supreme Court has held in Mennonite Bd. Of Missions v. Adams that a secured party possesses a substantial property interest that is significantly affected by a foreclosure sale; and since the secured party possesses a legally protected property interest, it is constitutionally entitled to notice reasonably calculated to appraise it of the pending foreclosure sale. 462 U.S. 791, 103 S.Ct. 2706 (1983).The boldface emphasis was from Ms. Lejarde.</p>

Rinegard-Guirma v. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> in United States District Court in Oregon, Civil Case No. 10-1065-PK.&nbsp; In the trust records, which I found on Bloomberg, the loan has the number 404029308.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON June 27, 2006, <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span>, the nation's largest mortgage lender, was about to close its books on a record-breaking six-month run. The housing market was on fire and Countrywide's earnings were soaring. Despite all the euphoria inside the company, some executives noticed that Angelo R. Mozilo, the company's brash and imperious chief executive, seemed subdued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a town hall meeting that day with 110 of the company's highest-ranking executives in Calabasas, Calif., Mr. Mozilo sat alone on a stage, fielding questions and offering rosy predictions about his company's prospects. But then he struck a sober note in response to a question from one of his colleagues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The questioner wanted to know what, if anything, worried Mr. Mozilo, according to a participant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wake up every day frightened that something is going to happen to Countrywide,'' Mr. Mozilo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year and a half later, that day arrived. In January 2008, Countrywide, the company he had built from a two-man mortgage operation into a lending behemoth, had to sell itself to <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> at a bargain price because it was being smothered by losses tied to a mountain of sketchy loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet almost until the moment Countrywide was taken over, Mr. Mozilo was publicly buoyant about its ability to ride out the mortgage crisis. Privately, however, he occasionally offered a gloomier assessment of Countrywide's prospects and practices, according to e-mail and interviews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Mr. Mozilo, now 71, knew about Countrywide's problems, and precisely when he knew it, was what eventually led the Securities and Exchange Commission to file civil securities fraud charges against him last year. And on Friday, in the Los Angeles courtroom of John F. Walter, a federal District Court judge, representatives for Mr. Mozilo and for two of his top lieutenants -- David Sambol, Countrywide's former president, and Eric Sieracki, the company's former chief financial officer -- settled those charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the settlement, Mr. Mozilo and his co-defendants didn't admit to any wrongdoing. But Mr. Mozilo agreed to pay $67.5 million in a penalty and reparations to investors and is permanently banned from serving as an officer or a director of a public company. Mr. Sambol is paying $5.52 million in a penalty and reparations and agreed to a three-year ban from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Mr. Sieracki agreed to pay a $130,000 penalty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The settlement is a signal event in the credit crisis and its aftermath, including the foreclosure debacle that is now rattling the mortgage market and upending the lives of average homeowners. Although <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> settled securities fraud charges earlier this year, Mr. Mozilo is the first prominent chief executive to be held personally accountable for questionable business practices that contributed to the housing bubble, the dizzying financial machinations that surrounded it, and a ruinous lending spree that ultimately threatened to undermine the nation's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mozilo and his two former colleagues were accused of misrepresenting the company's declining lending standards during 2006 and 2007 and portraying themselves publicly as underwriters of high-quality mortgages even as they learned that the company's loans were becoming increasingly risky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government also contended that Mr. Mozilo and Mr. Sambol improperly profited on inside information about the company's problematic loans when they sold Countrywide shares. From May 2005 to the end of 2007, Mr. Mozilo generated $260 million from his stock sales, while Mr. Sambol's sales produced $40 million, the government says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers for Mr. Mozilo declined to comment. Mr. Sambol's lawyer said his client had ''put the matter behind him for the benefit of his family and loved ones.'' Mr. Sieracki's lawyer noted that the S.E.C. had decided not to pursue fraud charges against his client and that his client had not been barred from serving at a public company. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> is paying Mr. Mozilo's legal bills. Countrywide is paying $5 million toward Mr. Sambol's repayment to investors and $20 million of Mr. Mozilo's reparations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.E.C.'s legal team, led by John M. McCoy III, associate regional director of the enforcement division, said the settlement amounted to a hard-won victory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement on Friday, Mr. McCoy said: ''This settlement will provide affected shareholders significant financial relief, and reinforces the message that corporate officers have a personal responsibility to provide investors with an accurate and complete picture of known risks and uncertainties facing a company.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Battered by widespread criticism that it failed to corral scam artists like Bernard L. Madoff and to effectively police Wall Street as a whole during the years leading up to the credit crisis, the S.E.C. may now regain some stature as a successful litigator and investor advocate from its settlement with Mr. Mozilo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As is the case with most settlements, this is a compromise where nobody comes out a complete winner,'' said Lewis D. Lowenfels, an authority on securities law at Tolins &amp; Lowenfels. ''The S.E.C. gets a substantial monetary settlement and a bar with respect to Mozilo serving as an officer or director. On Mozilo's side, he is probably satisfied to have this behind him. He suffers a considerable stain on his reputation, has to pay a substantial amount of money but retains significant wealth and at the age of 71 may find the possibility of being an officer or director of another public company less enticing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL began operations in 1969, when Mr. Mozilo and his mentor, David Loeb, refugees from an established mortgage lender, decided to start their own loan originator. The company grew slowly at first, but by 2004, Countrywide was the nation's largest home lender, generating annual revenue of $8.6 billion. Mr. Mozilo ran the company alone after Mr. Loeb retired in 2000. (Mr. Loeb died in 2003.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An up-by-the-bootstraps entrepreneur -- his father was a butcher in the Bronx -- Mr. Mozilo was obsessed with wresting market share away from his buttoned-down rivals in the staid world of banking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I run into these guys on Wall Street all the time who think they're something special because they went to Ivy League schools,'' he told The New York Times in 2005. ''We're always underestimated. And we still are. I am. I must say, it bothered me when I was younger -- their snobbery and their looking down on us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an industry that favored low-key behavior and conservative dress, Mr. Mozilo stood apart. He offered blunt opinions about banking and was open about his corporate aspirations. To complement his ever-present tan, he wore flashy clothes and drove expensive cars like Rolls-Royces that were often painted in a shade of gold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he managed his business for most of its history with a tight focus on the bottom line and on vigilant lending practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, Countrywide specialized in plain-vanilla, fixed-rate loans. As recently as 2003, such mortgages accounted for 95 percent of the company's loans, according to regulatory filings. Countrywide was the biggest supplier of mortgage loans to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, the federally backed mortgage finance giant that was also hobbled in the credit crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, Countrywide's sober-minded lending style changed significantly. It began aggressively offering loans to first-time home buyers and to borrowers with modest incomes. These mortgages were known in the industry as ''affordability products,'' but that ho-hum designation belied the potential financial dangers embedded in the loans if borrowers -- particularly low-income borrowers -- wound up unable to pay their debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Countrywide embraced such loans with gusto. For example, adjustable-rate mortgages -- those with a low introductory rate that could ratchet up in later years -- accounted for about 18 percent of Countrywide's business in 2003. But a year later, they made up 49 percent of its loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subprime loans also grew in 2004, to 11 percent of its originations, up from 4.6 percent in 2003. These loans often required no down payments and very little documentation of borrowers' incomes, assets or employment; they generated immense profits to Countrywide but, again, presented a bevy of risks. And even when the going got rough for some homeowners, Countrywide didn't hesitate to take a hard line with borrowers who fell behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A born salesman, Mr. Mozilo promoted his company's prospects wherever he went. In front of a crowd of investors or analysts, he would predict what Countrywide would generate in profits five years down the road and how many of its competitors the company would vanquish. No matter what, Countrywide would survive, he vowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over the entire history of this country, housing prices have never gone down nationally. They have gone down in some local areas, but never nationally,'' he told an interviewer for CNBC in early 2005. ''Secondly, any homeownership over the 10 years has proved to be the best investment that you could ever make. Over any 10-year period, housing prices go up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later that year, he was equally optimistic when he again visited CNBC's studios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From our perspective -- and we've been doing this for 38 years -- we're still in a terrific mortgage market,'' he said. ''So the road ahead to us appears to be extremely vibrant, very sound.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the wheels were coming off of the Countrywide cart in 2007, Mr. Mozilo's upbeat public pronouncements continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think you have to keep things in perspective. You know, there's an old saying that you don't know who's swimming naked until the tide goes out, and obviously the tide's gone out,'' he told CNBC in March 2007, when a number of once-successful subprime lenders were plunging toward bankruptcy. ''I think it's a mistake to apply what's happening to them to the more diversified financial services companies such as Countrywide.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> invested $2 billion in Countrywide in August 2007 -- a move that caused many analysts to question Countrywide's financial wherewithal and its ability to remain independent -- Mr. Mozilo again struck an optimistic note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Countrywide's future's going to be great. You know, it's always been great,'' he told CNBC at the time. ''So I think, down the line, this is going to be a better company, a more profitable company and a company that's going to be a great investment for shareholders as we continue down the line. Because the market ultimately will come to us. This is America. People want to own homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRIVATELY, however, Mr. Mozilo had long been worried about some of the loans his company favored, as indicated by e-mails he sent to his deputies. And this gulf between Mr. Mozilo's private views and his public proclamations went to the heart of the S.E.C.'s case against him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning in 2005, for example, he fretted about lending practices at Countrywide, e-mail messages show. One target of his ire was the ''pay-option adjustable-rate mortgage,'' a loan that let borrowers pay a fraction of the interest owed and none of the principal during an introductory period. These loans put homes within many borrowers' financial grasp -- at least initially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a borrower made only modest payments, the shortfall was added to the principal balance on the loan, meaning that the mortgage would grow in size. Given this arithmetic, borrowers could wind up owing more than their homes were worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, pay-option A.R.M.'s accounted for 6 percent of Countrywide's originations. Two years later, they accounted for 21 percent of its loans. The loans were moneymakers for Countrywide; internal company documents show that the company made gross profit margins of more than 4 percent on such loans, double the 2 percent generated on standard loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Countrywide pushed the lucrative loans hard. A sales document called ''Pay Option A.R.M.'s Made Simple'' asked rhetorically what kinds of customers would be interested in these loans. ''Anyone who wants the lowest possible payment!'' was one of the answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these loans unnerved Mr. Mozilo, as his e-mails indicate. In April 2006, for example, he learned that almost three-quarters of the company's pay-option customers had chosen to make the minimum payment the prior February, up from 60 percent the previous August, according to the S.E.C.'s complaint. In an e-mail to Mr. Sambol, Mr. Mozilo wrote: ''Since over 70 percent have opted to make the lower payment it appears that it is just a matter of time that we will be faced with much higher resets and therefore much higher delinquencies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two months later, and just one day after he talked up his company's pay-option A.R.M.'s to investors at a Wall Street conference, Mr. Mozilo wrote an e-mail to Mr. Sambol predicting trouble ahead for many borrowers in these mortgages. They ''are going to experience a payment shock which is going to be difficult if not impossible for them to manage,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in September 2006, Mr. Mozilo wrote an e-mail saying the company had no way to assess the risks of holding pay-option A.R.M.'s on its balance sheet. ''The bottom line is that we are flying blind on how these loans will perform in a stressed environment of higher unemployment, reduced values and slowing home sales,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Countrywide product that concerned Mr. Mozilo was its so-called 80/20 loan, named for the fact that the combination allowed a borrower to receive money covering 100 percent of a home's purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mozilo had become worried about these loans in the first quarter of 2006, when HSBC Bank, a buyer of Countrywide's 80-20 loans, began forcing the lender to repurchase some that <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> contended were defective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In all my years in the business, I have never seen a more toxic product,'' he wrote to Mr. Sambol in an April 17, 2006, e-mail cited by the S.E.C. ''With real estate values coming down ... the product will become increasingly worse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such e-mails suggest that by mid-2006, Mr. Mozilo had recognized how reckless some of his company's lending had become. And just three months later, according to the S.E.C. complaint, he met with his financial adviser to increase the amount of Countrywide shares he could cash in under a planned executive stock-sale program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mozilo had always been a big seller, and rarely a buyer, of the Countrywide shares he was granted as a part of his compensation. The timing of some of his sales, however, has drawn the scrutiny of the S.E.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, on Sept. 25, a day before writing the e-mail about how Countrywide was ''flying blind'' on pay-option A.R.M.'s, he set up a new planned stock-selling program for himself, known as a 10b-5 plan, the S.E.C. said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such plans allow executives to sell stock regularly, without running afoul of regulations governing the sale of stock around significant corporate announcements. Mr. Mozilo also set up plans enabling a family foundation and a trust he oversaw to sell shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Altogether, the S.E.C. said, from November 2006 to October 2007, he sold more than five million Countrywide shares under his personal plan. His gains were $140 million, the S.E.C. said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mozilo has long maintained that his stock sales were not unusual, and in the past Countrywide has said that it and Mr. Mozilo were battered by economic forces beyond their control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one, including Mr. Mozilo, could have foreseen the unprecedented combination of events that led to the problems borrowers, lenders and investors face with many of these loans today,'' a Countrywide spokesman told The Times in 2007. ''Countrywide is proud of its role in making homeownership affordable to lower-income households.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lawyers and analysts say Friday's settlement means that Mr. Mozilo's legacy is likely to be something quite different from that of a banker who brought homeownership to the masses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mozilo is agreeing to a permanent ban on serving as an officer or director of a public company,'' said James A. Fanto, a professor at Brooklyn Law School and a specialist in corporate and securities law. ''That is a significant punishment and does not look good for his legacy.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ABINGDON SQUARE PARK, a 0.222-acre triangle of greenery in the West Village, is not a place that requires much time for exploration. A lap of its curving byways, around a manicured garden island, takes just a minute or two. Indeed, most everyone there on a recent sunny Saturday was partaking in the square's main day-to-day activity: sitting on benches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet that is a pleasure, devotees say, that should not be understated. For neighbors of the park it is a place to read, to sit quietly in the shade, to meet friends and in general to retreat from the busy streets just a few steps away. The advantages of life near a big park, with acres of forest and lawn, are well known and well chronicled. But living on a square like Abingdon, or any of a handful of other patches of greenery tucked in around New York, is a more intimate and private experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a wonderful place to just go and collect your thoughts and think about current projects,'' said Michael Neville, an artist and composer who has lived for 33 years on Bank Street, about a block from Abingdon Square. ''The plantings, the landscape and the whole environment is just so beautiful and calming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that, real estate brokers say, means apartments and houses on green spaces, even very small ones, sell or rent for a premium. Peter Comitini, a vice president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said the appeal of places like Duane Park in TriBeCa, where he recently sold a three-bedroom co-op unit, was largely visual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It creates a little more room to breathe between you and the next closest building,'' Mr. Comitini said, ''and I think that has value right there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides interesting locations -- squares tend to be in places where the urban grid breaks down, like Greenwich Village, the Upper West Side near Broadway and Lower Manhattan -- Mr. Comitini said units near squares had built-in advantages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They offer greater light and views, and those are things that are at a premium in the city,'' he said. ''The stuff that doesn't sell is the stuff that faces a dark shaftway in the back, and this is the polar opposite of that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People in search of a unit on a square have a range of options. Some vest-pocket parks, like Verdi Square, at West 73rd Street and Broadway, are bustling and vibrant. Others, like Jackson Square, just northeast of Abingdon at Eighth and Greenwich Avenues, are shady and placid. Most are in Manhattan, where open space is rarest, but there are exceptions, like Cobble Hill Park, on Verandah Place in Brooklyn, a 0.585-acre site where a neighborhood petition drive in the 1960s defeated plans for an apartment building. Two-family town houses there have sold in recent years for $2.2 million or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Straus Park, at Broadway and 106th Street in Manhattan, is named for the department store mogul Isidor Straus and his wife, Ida, both of whom perished in the sinking of the Titanic. Among the visitors to the park on a recent afternoon were a man eating lunch, a mother and child blowing bubbles, and a pigtailed girl jumping rope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across Broadway, at 272 West 107th Street, two condominium units that look out over the park are for sale. One is 15C, with three bedrooms and two and a half baths, on the market for $2.75 million, and listed by Lisa Lippman and Scott Moore at Brown Harris Stevens. It has a large eat-in kitchen, and its balcony and floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room look out to the Hudson River. The square is far below; the treetops look like a welcome mat of greenery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on the Upper West Side, but on a much busier corner, is 200 West 72nd Street, a new rental building that faces Verdi Square. The focal point of that square is a subway station, served by the No. 1 local and the Nos. 2 and 3 express trains. Gray's Papaya is on one side of Broadway, <span class="companylink">Urban Outfitters</span> on the other, and the building has a <span class="companylink">Trader Joe's</span> on the ground floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building's unit closest to the action is 3H, a two-bedroom two-bath apartment that Cody Moore, an agent in the leasing office, said was available for $9,800 a month. Its tall windows, at treetop level, afford a dizzying perch for people-watching: the sidewalks are a constant stream of pedestrians. Apartment 15E, with three bedrooms and two and a half baths, is at a greater remove, but it has an 830-square-foot terrace from which it is possible to hear a saxophone player in the square. Monthly rent, Ms. Moore said, is $18,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenacre Park, on 51st Street between Second and Third Avenues, is not a square like the others, formed by the intersection of multiple streets. Instead, it is in a small notch of land at midblock, owned and maintained by the private Greenacre Foundation. Started by the Rockefeller family, the foundation maintains a small concession stand, a handful of tables and chairs, and the park's centerpiece, a tiered waterfall 25 feet high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The waterfall is audible through open windows in some units of the redeveloped condominium building just west of the park, at 211 East 51st Street. The view of the park from 6F and 7F, one-bedroom units on the eastern side of the building, is mostly of the tops of honey locust trees. But along with the units' white-oak floors and marble counters, the waterfall is a sort of amenity: a very large white-noise generator. Both units are listed by Josephine LaPietra at H. Justin Realty, 6F for $1.075 million and 7F for $1.095 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenacre Park has looked very much the same since it was founded in 1971, but many of the city's squares are only recently coming into their own after decades of disuse and deferred maintenance. Abingdon Square is one: it was the beneficiary of a renovation between 2000 and 2004 and is now maintained by the nonprofit Abington Square Alliance, to which some of the surrounding buildings contribute a monthly per-unit fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jackson Square, with an even more recent renovation, is another. It has free wireless Internet, courtesy of an adjacent new condominium building at 122 Greenwich Avenue. Michelle MacLachlan, a resident of 122 Greenwich, says she goes to the square to read, sip coffee or do a bit of work. Ms. MacLachlan, who is 25 and works as a broker in the financial industry, describes the open space as precious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't think of that when you live in New York,'' she said. ''You don't feel like that ever exists.'' It is, she added, quite different from the woodsier setting around her native Vancouver, British Columbia. ''It's crazy how people will get so excited about 10 trees in a square,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. MacLachlan, who lives on the Eighth Avenue side of her building, said some neighbors had paid extra to face the square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The curving glass building, also known as One Jackson Square, has several available units on the park. One of them, 6D, a two-bedroom three-bath, is listed with Heather Cook of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group at $6.35 million; it has a 319-square-foot terrace overlooking the square across Greenwich Avenue. A bedroom, which has floor-to-ceiling windows and one of two wood-burning fireplaces, offers an even more dramatic view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building's penthouse is also available. It has four bedrooms and a private roof deck with a pool and an outdoor kitchen. It is listed at $21.75 million, also through Ms. Cook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A short walk to the south, Unit 3C at 302 West 12th Street, a one-bedroom condo, is more humble. It has a wood-burning fireplace and access to a leafy common roof deck, but its fixtures are relatively drab. Still, it faces Abingdon Square, and is on the market for $1.395 million, listed through Robert Browne at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lee Zimmerman, another Corcoran broker, is a founder of the Abingdon Square Alliance and lives in the building. One of the best things about the area, Mr. Zimmerman said, is getting to know the neighborhood characters who frequent the square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One is Philip Thompson, 81, who has lived nearby on Jane Street since 1965. Mr. Thompson's name appears on a bench in the square: He dedicated a plaque to his longtime partner, Alex Szogyi, who died in 2007. They used to sit there together, and in recent years, Mr. Thompson said, the green space has provided solace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you're sharing your apartment with somebody for so many years, the loneliness is very difficult,'' he said. ''So just to be surrounded by the trees and flowers -- all of a sudden you're chatting with somebody.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zimmerman said he knew that feeling of reflection from the many hours he had spent in the square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not Central Park; it's not Prospect Park; it's not Battery Park,'' he said. ''You kind of lose yourself in those kinds of parks. In the smaller parks, you find yourself.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEDBUGS have infiltrated more and more places in New York City, and now they've even found their way into co-op and condominium contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York State Legislature passed a law this summer requiring city landlords to disclose any history of bedbug infestation before leasing an apartment. Real estate lawyers and brokers say that even though the law was intended to address rentals, bedbug disclosure has become an issue in the sales market as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law requires landlords to give renters written notice before a lease is signed indicating whether the apartment being considered, or any other apartment in the building, has been infested within the last year. Anyone renting out an apartment in a co-op or condo would also have to comply with the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been confusion in the real estate industry over the scope of the law, but Nancy Peters, a spokeswoman for the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, said last week that co-ops must also follow the law when there is a sale, because new buyers enter into a proprietary lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The division has issued a form (http://www.dhcr.state.ny.us/Forms/Rent/dbbn.pdf[http://www.dhcr.state.ny.us/Forms/Rent/dbbn.pdf]) with a checklist that clearly states whether there has been any bedbug infestation in the apartment or in the building within the last year, and also whether any ''eradication measures'' have been taken. There is no penalty for not complying, although renters who do not receive a disclosure form can file a complaint requiring disclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, some lawyers representing co-op and condo buyers had already made bedbug disclosure a part of contract negotiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early September, about a week after the law went into effect, Daniel Farris, a senior vice president of Brown Harris Stevens, said he came across a bedbug rider while reviewing a client's proposed contract to buy a two-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rider, which was proposed by the buyer's lawyer, read, ''The seller has no knowledge of the existence or presence of bedbugs in the unit either currently or in the past.'' The seller signed the rider, and Mr. Farris's buyer is now in contract for the apartment. Mr. Farris said he routinely counseled buyers to ask whether a unit has had a history of leaks or other problems and to have the building checked for rodents. He said he thought the rider made perfect sense, ''for your own level of comfort; a buyer should know what they're getting into.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, in a recent condo sale on the Upper West Side, Louise Phillips Forbes, an executive vice president of Halstead Property, represented a seller and said she spent about six days hunting down bedbug history, or the lack thereof, to help seal the deal. The buyer asked about bedbugs and was not satisfied just knowing that the seller knew of no bedbugs in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building had recently switched managing agents, so Ms. Forbes had to get statements from both agents, and she also checked with three members of the condo board, none of whom knew of any bedbug problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, a Democrat from the Upper West Side who sponsored the legislation, said that it had been written to address rentals in New York City, but that she planned to introduce a separate disclosure law for co-ops and condos next year. ''I think it's great if people are voluntarily disclosing the information already,'' she said. ''Since this is such an urban epidemic, the more transparency the better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bedbug disclosure has been a major topic of discussion in the real estate industry in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been fielding a lot of calls from our members, which is normal whenever a new law comes into effect,'' said Angela Sung, the senior vice president for management services and government affairs of the Real Estate Board of New York, which represents 12,000 building owners, managers, builders, brokers and lawyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Kirschenbaum, the general counsel for Cooper Square Realty, which manages about 400 buildings in New York City, said, ''I've been in this business for a long time, and I can't recall a less well-drafted statute.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property managers and landlords said that because the disclosure form used the term ''vacancy lease,'' which tends to apply only when discussing rent-regulated apartments, it suggested that market-rate rentals and apartment sales in co-ops or condos might not be included.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also said compliance would be difficult because the disclosure form requires owners or managing agents to state definitively whether there has been any bedbug infestation in any apartment in the building. ''What the form should say is that the owner or managing agent is providing information that is to the best of their belief,'' Mr. Kirschenbaum said. While managing agents of rental buildings might have a thorough bedbug history for a building, he said, ''managing agents won't necessarily know about an apartment in a co-op or condo, because owners don't have to report bedbugs, and they might get treatment themselves.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you out of your mind to even consider buying a foreclosed property right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Todd Phelps and Paul Whitehead didn't think they were last month when they were the winning bidders in a foreclosure auction on the steps of the main Riverside, Calif., county courthouse. They thought they had won the lottery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, they had been living in a rent-controlled apartment in Santa Monica and waiting out the housing bubble in hopes of buying a weekend getaway in the Palm Springs area. And on Sept. 10, they thought they had finally done it, getting a house for $137,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several days later, however, they realized that what they had really bought was a second mortgage from <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> on a house that still had an enormous, unpaid primary loan. In other words, they did not own the home free and clear, and the auction company wouldn't give back their $137,000 check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tale is certainly enough to give anyone pause, especially as several banks slow or halt their foreclosure proceedings amid questions about how they cut corners to speed up the process. Still, roughly half the recent home sales in hard-hit states like California, Arizona and Nevada have been foreclosures or short sales, according to RealtyTrac. Anyone wanting to buy homes in those and other states hit hard by the housing crisis will probably encounter these sorts of properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the houses will be tempting for scores of first-time homebuyers, second-home seekers and people looking to get an early jump on buying a retirement home while prices and interest rates are low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So given the pitfalls, are they crazy? The answer is no, not always. But it's important to keep something in mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The whole foreclosure process is adversarial, even though it's nonjudicial in many areas,'' said Tom Cahraman, the presiding judge in Riverside County. ''One person is losing their home, and another person is trying to get a new home at a discount price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's absolutely right. Strap on the body armor, and think hard about the following five factors if you find foreclosed homes even remotely enticing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE LOAN First of all, many banks that own foreclosed properties would prefer that you stay far away from their listings. In fact, they may sell a property for less money to an investor who can pay all cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You, on the other hand, will probably need a mortgage, and your need for bank approval can delay the sales process because your lender may hesitate when you say you're interested in a foreclosed property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Lenders will usually only give you a loan on homes that are pretty ready to be lived in,'' said Andy Tolbert of Oneir HD Realty in Longwood, Fla., who represents buyers shopping for foreclosed and other homes and invests in distressed property herself. ''If the carpet is ripped out and the toilets are missing, they are not going to give the loan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is especially important to consider if you're using a Federal Housing Administration or Veterans Administration loan, where there may be particularly stringent requirements. ''I have seen V.A. lenders require torn carpet to be repaired or replaced because they see it as a hazard to the new occupants,'' said Mike Goblet, a mortgage broker with United Mortgage Financial Group in Mesa, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some exceptions. The F.H.A. offers a mortgage called a 203(k) that may allow you to borrow money to buy and substantially rehabilitate a foreclosed property. But it could take a while to find a bank that offers the loan and to get your project approved. Some sellers, meanwhile, won't let you buy with F.H.A. loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE AUCTION PROCESS Foreclosure auctions can be a dangerous place for people who don't know what they're doing or are relying on help from people who are sloppy or negligent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Phelps and Mr. Whitehead had a real estate broker who was supposed to be checking the records of the home they wanted to buy at auction. But the broker did not discover, or did not report to them, the fact that the property had several claims against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They considered suing the broker, but first turned to the auction company, Executive Trustee Services, a unit of GMAC Mortgage (one of the companies that suspended many foreclosures in recent weeks). At the company's Burbank, Calif., office, a representative told Mr. Phelps that all sales were final and that Executive Trustee was merely a middleman. Mr. Phelps asked for further documentation and was told that he could have it when he returned with a subpoena. Classy, no? Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for the company, did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple also wrote plaintive letters to executives at <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>, now part of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, because both defaulted loans attached to the home they were trying to buy came from that bank. (The auction company was working on the bank's behalf.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a couple of rounds of e-mail and phone inquiries on my part, the bank decided to give Mr. Phelps and Mr. Whitehead their money back. ''Given the circumstances, we have decided to rescind the sale on the property and return the funds to the buyers,'' Vickee J. Adams, a <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the couple, having nearly lost most of their life savings, now realize that they were in way over their heads bidding for homes at auction and were lucky to get their money back. ''Trust no one,'' Mr. Phelps said. ''We didn't get involved when the market was going crazy and everyone was getting subprime mortgages, and we felt like we were smart and that this was our reward for sitting on the sidelines. But there are enough bargains to be had on a straight sale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE INSPECTION Let's say you do manage to get a loan, resist the auctions and take the straight sale approach, shopping through a real estate agent. You'll want to make any bid for a home contingent on a thorough inspection from someone familiar with foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mold may be your first concern, especially in more humid climates, given that many foreclosed homes have been uninhabited for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's sabotage. You should arrange (or have the real estate agent arrange) to have the power and water turned back on before the inspection if possible. Why? The previous owner (or vandals who have been in the home since) may have cut wires behind walls or poked holes in pipes in various places. Having running water and power can make these things easier to detect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pour-concrete-down-the-toilet trick is one that most good inspectors know to look for. But Jon Bolton of The Inspectagator in Oviedo, Fla., recently ran into a bit of destructive ingenuity he'd never encountered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Someone went on the roof with a bag of cement and dropped it down the chimney,'' he recalled. ''It rained, and now you have a solid block of concrete somewhere where it's extremely difficult to get in to break it up. That's just wrong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, don't forget to inspect the minutes of the condominium board or homeowners' association, if there is one. It may be in deep financial trouble if other foreclosures have occurred. Ms. Tolbert says that a good title insurer may be able to help with contacts if you have no luck finding the manager or treasurer on your own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE TITLE INSURANCE Speaking of which, title insurance is a must, particularly now. In the unlikely event that a former owner somehow wins back rights to the foreclosed home you end up buying and then tries to kick you out, you will need to make a title insurance claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if you plan to put a lot of money into fixing up the home, you'll want to ask about a rider on the insurance policy that can cover you for more than what you paid to buy the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE WAITING GAME Still worried about the prospect of former owners showing up someday and asking for their home back? Cyd Weeks, a real estate agent with Palmcoasting.com in Palm Coast, Fla., suggests waiting a few months before trying to buy a foreclosed home. Now that all eyes are on the foreclosure process, he said, homes coming on the market early next year will probably have been foreclosed upon with much more care and precision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Ms. Weeks's tip suggests a larger point. Given the foreclosure moratorium that some banks have put in place and the lengthy investigations and lawsuits that are sure to follow, there is no rush to buy as long as you don't have to move or if renting is an option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take your time. Assemble a panel of experts and apprentice yourself to them. And watch the listings carefully. For better or for worse, foreclosed properties are going to be available for a very, very long time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Performing arts centers typically present performances, not develop real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark is stepping up its involvement in real estate by putting its founding president and chief executive, Lawrence P. Goldman, at the helm of its newly created NJPAC Development Corporation, the center announced on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The arts centers that are going to be successful in the next decade or two are the ones that diversify their revenues,'' Mr. Goldman said in an interview. ''The basic economic model of presentations, tickets sales and fund-raising is beginning to break down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goldman, 64, will step down as chief executive in June, the end of the fiscal year, after almost 22 years of leading the performing arts center, which is among the largest in the nation. The center's board has established a search committee to find a successor for Mr. Goldman, who started in 1989 after serving as vice president of Carnegie Hall and who oversaw the design and construction of the center, which opened its doors in 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For an arts center to truly live up to its full potential, it must focus on being more than just a venue; it must be a force in the creation of economic opportunity,'' Cory A. Booker, the mayor of Newark, said in an interview. ''Newark is the arts capital of New Jersey. We are still not fulfilling our potential in terms of the economic impact the arts could be having.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move does not reflect a state of emergency at the center, a need for a quick infusion of money or any shift in priorities, Mr. Goldman said. Rather, it represents a recognition that, given the economic climate, it makes sense to develop alternative sources of income and to play a more active role in animating the center's neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to make it the Piazza Navona of Newark,'' Mr. Goldman said, speaking of the popular square in Rome, ''with cafes and restaurants and galleries, to revitalize the area and make it a 24/7 environment. What Newark needs is people downtown.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sense the performing arts center has been preparing for this shift from the beginning, having originally acquired more land than it needed for a cultural building: a total of 12 acres. (Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, by comparison, has about 16.) That leaves eight acres available for private development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas H. Kean, who as governor ushered in the arts center, said he had Lincoln Center in mind when determining that urban development should be integral to the center's activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I saw Lincoln Center go in and what happened to the neighborhood surrounding it,'' he said in an interview. As the area became commercially successful with Lincoln Center's development, he said, the center itself did not have a corresponding benefit because it had not invested more directly in neighborhood property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William J. Marino, the New Jersey center's chairman, said the timing was right. ''The real estate opportunities are better than they have been in quite some time,'' he said. ''Real estate is one of Larry's strengths.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goldman will become president of the corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the arts center. Among its first orders of business will be the completion of One Theater Square, a 1.2-acre, 44-story, mixed-use residential building that is next to the arts center and is slated to be the tallest building in Newark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gov. Christopher J. Christie has approved $38 million in tax credits over 10 years for the project, which is being developed with Dranoff Properties. The 325-unit tower still requires $160 million in financing. In addition to amenities like a pool and a health club, the building is to include 20,000 square feet of retail space, and 20 percent of its apartments will rent at below market rates to qualifying artists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the corporation Mr. Goldman will also focus on the planning and development of two other sites that are contiguous with, and controlled by, the center. The corporation is working ''in a preliminary way'' with <span class="companylink">Liberty Property Trust</span> of Philadelphia, Mr. Goldman said, on a commercial building on at least one of the other properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goldman came to the arts center with the idea of undertaking real estate ventures, having helped shepherd the expansion and renovation of Carnegie Hall. In the 1980s a small parking lot of Carnegie's between the hall and the Russian Tea Room restaurant, he said, was returning about $250,000 to the hall. That space now has Carnegie Hall Tower, developed by the <span class="companylink">Rockrose Development Corporation</span> and designed by Cesar Pelli. The property now generates more than $2 million a year for Carnegie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The arts center has to be the town square of New Jersey,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''Corporate events, weddings, bar mitzvahs, poetry festivals, other nonprofits doing their fund-raisers here, graduations, job fairs. It has to be more than what's on your stages.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To a large extent, Mr. Goldman said, the development corporation is an attempt to build on the arts center's success. The center, which has an annual operating budget of $30 million, has been in the black for five years running. It has built an endowment of more than $55 million and raises about $11 million a year. And the center is notably diverse, with minorities making up 27 percent of the audience and 50 percent of the staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What this is saying is, the arts center is now stabilized -- we are doing pretty well in a difficult environment,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''And it is time to focus on the planning and development of the property we control.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-running feud between the developer Sheldon H. Solow and the Fisher real estate family appears to be over, again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fisher family, once Mr. Solow's partner in a planned $4 billion development on nine acres along First Avenue, filed a lawsuit last year seeking to force Mr. Solow to pay them a final $111 million for their stake in that project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow countersued. But with Mr. Solow due in court this week for a deposition before a special referee, the two sides reached a settlement, according to a notice filed Thursday in State Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can tell you we're pleased and we will be buying out the Fishers' interest," said Andrew Hayes, general counsel for Mr. Solow's real estate company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Mennitt, a lawyer for the Fisher family, confirmed the settlement, but like Mr. Hayes, he declined to go into detail because of a confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow, who is 82 and a billionaire, has been a subject of much speculation within the real estate industry this year because of frequent absences from the real estate scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, Mr. Solow's son, Stefan, oversaw a proposed settlement with the Fishers, after his father mysteriously stopped coming into the office. His lawyers notified the court of the action, but the elder Mr. Solow quickly reappeared and refused to sign the agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow also severed ties with the real estate broker who was trying to fill a giant block of vacant space in his flagship, 50-story skyscraper at 9 West 57th Street. No leasing deals have been completed since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current settlement would appear to be a victory for the Fishers, although it is difficult to know without the details. Mr. Hayes insisted that the Fishers had lost every motion they filed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow and the Fishers won a hotly contested auction 10 years ago for the nine acres along First Avenue, south of 42nd Street, when they agreed to pay <span class="companylink">Con Edison</span> more than $600 million for the property. But the 50-50 partnership quickly soured, and the Fishers began selling their interest to Mr. Solow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, Mr. Solow agreed to buy out their remaining 15 percent stake for $227 million. The Fishers subsequently sued when Mr. Solow failed to make a final $111 million payment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Not so long ago, the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was a hodgepodge of bunkerlike academic buildings, converted World War I-era factories, parking lots and even an occasional Quonset hut. But a 10-year development plan, nearly complete at a cost of $1.4 billion, has set a new mood -- avant-garde -- with 10 buildings by architects like Frank Gehry, <span class="companylink">Steven Holl</span> and Fumihiko Maki, as well as a revamped streetscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transformation was made possible by donations, portfolio investments and other financing sources like tax-exempt bonds -- as well as profits from M.I.T.'s commercial real estate activities, many in its own Kendall Square/East Cambridge neighborhood. The university owns about six million square feet of commercial real estate in the neighborhood, in addition to the 11 million square feet that make up its 160-acre campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president of M.I.T., Susan Hockfield, said, ''The physical campus was not keeping pace with the leading-edge research of our scientists and engineers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university's property investments, on and off its campus, have in turn drawn other investors and tenants from around the world. That has helped lift East Cambridge out of its postindustrial doldrums, turning it into a submarket with global cachet. Just this year, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Sanofi-Aventis</span> all leased space here. A few years ago, <span class="companylink">Novartis</span> moved its global research headquarters from Basel, Switzerland, to a building owned by M.I.T. next to the campus in Kendall Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''M.I.T. is instrumental in the success of Kendall Square as a commercial real estate market,'' said Hans G. Nordby a director of PPR, a CoStar Group company. Since 2003, Mr. Nordby said, 24 percent of the commercial space leased in the metropolitan area has been in Cambridge, although it has only 14 percent of the inventory, and 75 percent of those leases have had a Kendall Square address, he said. Much of the growth has come in the biotechnology sector, which barely existed 20 years ago, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The timing of M.I.T.'s development was fortunate, with most of the financing and plans in place well before the economic slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very difficult for colleges and universities to do development now with endowments down, the credit crunch, and if they're public institutions, state budget problems,'' said Randall Shearin, the editor of Student Housing Business magazine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when few major developments have opened on or off campuses, the corner of Main and Vassar Streets in Kendall Square is a showcase of new academic buildings intended to promote innovative research and learning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Main and Vassar is one of the most powerful interdisciplinary intersections on the planet,'' said Theresa M. Stone, the institute's executive vice president and treasurer. ''Therefore, leading edge companies want to locate here. We do the research. They develop the drugs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the newest buildings on campus, the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, designed by the architectural firm Ellenzweig, engineers and life science researchers will collaborate in the search for breakthroughs in cancer treatment. Next to it is perhaps the most-recognizable symbol of the new M.I.T., Mr. Gehry's Stata Center, which opened in 2004. It brings together students and researchers immersed in artificial intelligence, linguistics, electrical engineering and computer science. (M.I.T. sued Mr. Gehry and the builder in 2007, after leaks and cracks required repairs. The lawsuit was settled in March.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By allowing greater collaboration, these additions are changing how teaching and learning are carried out at the institute. At the Koch Center, for example, engineers are using nanoparticles as homing devices to deliver doses of therapies or chemotherapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university's new look also helps its neighborhood, said Peter Bekarian, a senior vice president of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, a real estate company. ''When M.I.T. enhances its campus, it resonates in the commercial real estate market,'' he said. Mr. Bekarian said Cambridge is recovering from the recession faster than other areas in the region, including downtown Boston, in large part because of activity in Kendall Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year the Kendall Square/East Cambridge market saw a net absorption of 120,000 square feet in the neighborhood's 13 million square-foot office and lab market. To equal that, downtown Boston, a 60 million- square-foot market, would have had to absorb 600,000 square feet. Instead, tenants vacated a million square feet more than they leased, said Rick Cleveland, the managing director for United States research services at Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kendall Square's vacancy rate is 11 percent. But in the six premier office towers with river views, it is just 4 percent, and landlords are pushing gross asking rents into the $50-a-square- foot range, about the same as prime space in downtown Boston. About 3 percent of East Cambridge's highest-quality lab space is vacant, and gross rents are about $75, said Mark Winters, an executive director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute's commercial property activity here is run by a 16-person team that reports to the president of the M.I.T. Investment Management Company, which oversees the university's $8.3 billion endowment. Profits flow into the endowment, often as unrestricted funds, and are used for general operations, including on-campus construction. And when M.I.T. sells a property, it retains a long-term ground lease. ''We never give up land,'' Ms. Stone said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 10 to 12 percent of the endowment is invested in real estate, and about half of it is near the campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute has already started its next development plan, which may call for a $1 billion investment on campus, although no projects have been authorized yet, Ms. Stone said. The university may develop an additional $1 billion in commercial space off campus, said Steven C. Marsh, managing director of real estate for the M.I.T. Investment Management Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an academic institution, M.I.T. differs from its commercial real estate counterparts because it can invest with a 10- to 20-year strategy rather than having to generate short-term returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, when opportunity knocks, M.I.T. can answer as nimbly as some of its private competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, for example, the institute won two tenants who had been courted by other Cambridge landlords ''very, very hard,'' Mr. Winters said. Last month, <span class="companylink">Sanofi-Aventis</span> agreed to lease nearly 110,000 square feet in 640 Memorial Drive, an M.I.T. building. The institute also signed up <span class="companylink">Aileron Therapeutics</span>, a biopharmaceutical company, for 24,000 square feet at 281 Albany Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As M.I.T completes the plan for this decade, Mr. Marsh is already working on one for the next 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">M.I.T. has won city approval for a new 410,000-square-foot build-to-suit structure at 610 Main Street and is considering how to enliven the area around the Kendall Square subway stop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After bringing in so many companies, Mr. Marsh said, ''now we want to focus on developing places for brilliant people to meet and collaborate.''</p>
