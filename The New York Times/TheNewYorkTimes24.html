<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite some signs of a weakening market, Manhattan's lofty real estate prices were little changed during the last quarter, according to a series of market reports released yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports showed that the number of apartments on the market rose and the number of sales fell during the second quarter of the year, a shift that suggests an increase in bargaining power for buyers rather than sellers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the economy strong and apartments in demand, buyers so far have not been able to translate that market power into lower prices over all. According to one report, released by Prudential Douglas Elliman, average sales prices of Manhattan apartments were up to $1.39 million, an increase of 6.6 percent over the prices in the first quarter of this year and 5.2 percent above those in the same period a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People out there wondering whether it is the right time to buy should make a decision based on their lifestyle, not by trying to sharpshoot the market,'' said Pamela Liebman, president of the Corcoran Group. ''When sellers lose their patience they will allow the prices to go down. Right now there is a lot of demand to support prices.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that sales activity picked up toward the end of the quarter, in deals that had not closed and were not counted in the second-quarter statistics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of the reports, using different methodologies, came up with different figures but similar explanations. While the Elliman report showed overall prices up modestly, a report by the Corcoran Group and another by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead showed a similar decline, by less than 5 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In each case, prices of cooperative apartments, which are usually located in older apartment buildings with stricter rules, showed more strength than newer condominiums. Douglas Elliman reported that average sales prices of co-ops rose by 18 percent over the prior quarter, while Brown Harris Stevens showed a 7 percent increase, and Corcoran showed a 1 percent decline. Prices on two-bedroom co-ops rose sharply in several of the reports.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominium prices were weaker, but the declines were attributed to scores of sales in new condominiums with smaller, less expensive apartments. Last year, when average apartment prices set records, there were many multimillion-dollar sales in other new condominiums, like the Time Warner Center in Columbus Circle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for Terra Holdings, which owns Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead, noted, for example, that while condo prices over all fell by 15 percent from the previous quarter, prices for one- and two-bedroom condos rose somewhat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With the economy this strong, we are not going to see a huge swaying of the market, one way or the other,'' he said, but rather ''a gradual change in different segments of the market based on supply and demand.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Elliman reported that the average condo sales price fell by 1.9 percent to $1.45 million. It put the median price of a Manhattan condo at $990,000 and a co-op at $722,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Inc., the appraisal firm that prepared the Elliman report, said the inventory of 7,640 condos listed in the second quarter was up 10 percent over the previous quarter and 53 percent over a year ago. He found the number of sales was down 3.5 percent from the last quarter, often the slowest of the year, and 15 percent from a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And despite the decline in condominium prices, he said that for the second month ever, condo sales made up more than half of all sales, even through there are far more co-ops in Manhattan. He attributed that to the intensive marketing campaigns for new condominiums.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, June 27 -- Sales of existing homes fell 1.2 percent in May as higher interest rates slowed buying activity, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 6.67 million units in May from a downwardly revised level of 6.75 million in April. The rate in May was 6.6 percent below the pace of 7.14 million units a year earlier, but slightly higher than analysts had expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David A. Lereah, the association's chief economist, said the data were consistent with his forecast of a soft landing for the housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over all, I think this is a pretty good report,'' he said. ''It demonstrates that the housing sector is slowing, but it's slowing in a manageable way.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the data also showed a buildup of inventories of unsold homes. A record 3.6 million homes were for sale at the end of May, representing a 6.5-month supply, compared with 6.1 months at the end of April and the largest monthly supply since May 1997, the trade group said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some overheated local markets, like Southern Florida, the supply of unsold homes has reached more than 10 months' worth, putting them on the cusp of price reductions, Mr. Lereah said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any downward adjustment in prices would probably last only a few months, he said, because of demand from home shoppers who have been waiting for opportunities to buy at more affordable prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's pent-up demand out there in these local markets where prices will soften because those local economies are very healthy,'' Mr. Lereah said. ''There's job creation, and there's also good migration of households into those areas.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, home prices still increased in May, both compared with April and a year earlier. The national median existing home price for all housing types was $230,000 in May, up 6 percent from $217,000 in May 2005 and up 3.6 percent from the April median of $222,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah said sales dropped more sharply in some markets, including Florida, Virginia, California and the District of Columbia. States where sales increased included Texas, North Carolina, Georgia and Utah. In the Northeast, the Realtors said existing home sales fell 4.2 percent, compared with April, and in the Midwest they fell 3.8 percent, while edging up 0.7 percent in the West and 0.4 percent in the South.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national average mortgage rate for conventional 30-year fixed-rate loans was 6.6 percent in May, up from 6.51 percent in April and 5.72 percent in May 2005.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, June 26 -- Sales of new homes rose in May, surprising economists who had forecast that housing would slow because of rising mortgage rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported Monday that sales of new single-family homes increased 4.6 percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.234 million units. But the median price of homes sold declined -- to $235,300, a drop of 4.3 percent from the April sales price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are still looking for sales of both new and existing homes to fall about 10 percent this year as rising mortgage rates crimp demand. The lowest mortgage rates in four decades helped propel sales to five consecutive annual records.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 4.6 percent increase pushed the sales rate to the highest level since December. It came after increases of 5.9 percent in April and 7.3 percent in March. The previous months' increases were helped by unusually mild weather.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For May, sales were up in all parts of the country except the Northeast, where they declined 7.9 percent, to an annual rate of 58,000 units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up 6 percent in the South, to an annual rate of 669,000. Sales rose 5.3 percent in the West, to an annual rate of 317,000 units, and increased 2.7 percent in the Midwest, to an annual rate of 190,000 units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in sales in May reduced the number of unsold new homes at the end of the month to 556,000, compared with the record of 560,000 at the end of April. It would take 5.5 months to exhaust the current inventory of homes at the May sales pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the huge backlog of unsold homes will put further downward pressure on prices in coming months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In keeping with the economic data, the Lennar Corporation, one of the nation's largest home builders, said Monday that its second-quarter profit surged 33 percent on sharply higher sales. But the company, which is based in Miami, cut its full-year earnings outlook on an anticipated slowdown of orders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar's second-quarter earnings rose to $324.7 million, or $2 a share, from $243.5 million, or $1.48 a share, in the year-earlier period. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial had expected earnings of $1.85 a share on sales of $3.87 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quarterly revenue rose 56 percent, to $4.58 billion from $2.93 billion in the year-earlier period as home sales climbed 53 percent.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York has a smaller share of middle-income families than any other major metropolitan area in the nation, and like residents of most American cities and suburbs, they live in a dwindling number of middle-income neighborhoods, according to a new analysis of census figures released yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only Los Angeles has a smaller proportion of middle-income neighborhoods than New York, and not by much.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In metropolitan New York, 16.2 percent of the families and 28.3 percent of the neighborhoods were identified as middle-income.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Middle-income neighborhoods are vanishing faster than middle-income families,'' said the nationwide analysis, done by the Brookings Institution in Washington.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis attributed the shrinking number of middle-income communities to, among other factors, gentrification of more marginal neighborhoods and a bunching of high-income families in more homogenous surroundings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It sounds like it's a function of changing income distribution,'' said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. ''What happened between 1990 and 2000 in metropolitan New York and especially New York City was that the number of really high-income households went up, and low-income went up and the middle shrank.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What looks like a shrinking middle is partly an upgrading of income,'' he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hollowing out was most pronounced in Manhattan, where 51 percent of neighborhoods were identified as high-income, 40 percent as low-income and only 8 percent as middle-income. Long Island ranked second only to Scranton with the highest proportion, 65 percent, of middle-income neighborhoods of any metropolitan areas in the nation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis found ''increasing heterogeneity in some neighborhoods,'' but concluded that ''by and large, however, families at either end of the distribution appeared to occupy more economically homogeneous neighborhoods in 2000 than they did in 1970.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, between 1970 and 2000, the share of neighborhoods classified as lower-income rose to 31 percent from 20 percent, middle-income neighborhoods declined to 30 percent from 42 percent, and higher-income neighborhoods remained almost unchanged, about 38 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You see a dramatic shift between 1970 and 1980 and then more stability since then, although the proportion of families with so-called middle incomes continues to decline,'' said Alan Berube, a fellow in the metropolitan policy program at Brookings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While concentrated poverty, where 40 percent or more of the population live below the poverty line, declined in many areas, those neighborhoods still tended to have incomes far below the median, which was about $42,000 in 2000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The share of New York City neighborhoods with very low incomes decreased in the 1990's, from 12.1 to 9.1 percent, and the share with low incomes increased, from 17.8 to 21.6 percent,'' Mr. Berube said. ''This may capture the decline in concentrated poverty, but it did not result in an increase in middle-income neighborhoods.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in the share of New York City middle-income families was smaller than in most other cities, including Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia. The 12-percentage-point drop in the share of New York City neighborhoods classified as middle-income was less than the much steeper declines in Baltimore, Chicago and Philadelphia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Queens and Brooklyn actually seem to remain havens for middle-income families,'' Mr. Berube said. ''Moreover, strong immigration to New York City during this period may have helped replenish its stock of moderate-income families and neighborhoods.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis suggests that further changes may have taken place since 2000, but does not quantify them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The question is whether, since 2000, housing price gains and gentrification might have 'tipped' lower-income neighborhoods into middle-income status, or middle-income neighborhoods into high-income status,'' Mr. Berube said. ''Just looking at the Greenpoint-Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, it's notable that only 8 of roughly 50 census tracts had median family incomes above the city median in 2000. So here and elsewhere we might see evidence of increasing middle-income neighborhoods by 2010.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staten Island had the highest percentage of very high-income neighborhoods, 56 percent, of any borough. In the Bronx, 56 percent were classified as low income, with fully 25 percent as very low, defined as less than 50 percent of the median.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the analysis found that middle-income neighborhoods declined in 2000 to 41 percent of all metropolitan neighborhoods, from 58 percent in 1970. In 12 metropolitan areas studied in greater detail, they declined to 23 percent from 45 percent in the central cities. Even in the suburbs, their share shrank to 44 percent from 64 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Families earning between 80 percent and 120 percent of their metropolitan-area median incomes -- what many would consider to be the 'middle class' -- shrank from 28 percent of the total in 1970 to less than 22 percent by 2000,'' according to the analysis, by Jason C. Booza, Jackie Cutsinger and George Galster of Wayne State University for Brookings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the growing share of high-income families in some areas could be considered positive, the analysis said, the sharper increase in lower-income families and the decline in middle-income families ''overshadowed that good news.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis defined very low income as less than 50 percent of the median in the area studied, low as 50 to 80 percent, high as 120 to 150 percent and very high as more than 150 percent above the median. In the 12 areas studied more thoroughly, moderate income ranged from $59,313 in Atlanta to $72,247 in Washington.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new homes rose in May, bouncing back from a disappointing April, the federal government reported yesterday. But the improvement may prove to be a temporary blip, as other numbers in the report pointed to a slowdown in the coming months and a market that is less robust than a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Department of Housing and Urban Development said new construction rose 5 percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1,957,000 homes. Still, that number was 3.8 percent less than in May 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase was not a sign of an upward trend, but more likely a rebound after three months of significant declines, economists said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists had predicted less of a bounce.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The one we got was larger than expected, but certainly not enough to overturn the idea that housing is in a contraction,'' a group of economists from Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist of PNC Financial, said the upturn in May probably ''marks one of the housing market's last hurrahs.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market had little reaction to the report. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index was virtually unchanged. The Nasdaq composite fell slightly, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose slightly. [Page C9.]  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign that construction is likely to taper off, the number of building permits declined considerably in May, to its lowest level since 2003. The rate was 2.1 percent lower than in April and down 8.5 percent from a year earlier. The decline in the number of permits usually shows up in the construction numbers within three months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken with other signs of slower growth in housing -- like a record number of unsold new homes on the market and a darkening financial outlook among builders -- the new construction numbers point to an overall slowdown from the boom of the last few years, economists said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think there's anything scary about what's happening in the housing market,'' Patrick Newport, an economist with Global Insight, said. ''It's just a slowdown from record-high numbers. It's just slowing down to a more stable pace.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government report hurt the stock values of some of the largest home-construction companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Toll Brothers, the largest builder of luxury homes, and D. R. Horton, the largest home building company, both posted losses. Other large home builders -- the Centex Corporation, Pulte Homes and the Lennar Corporation -- were also down for the day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock values of most major home construction companies have been pummeled over the last year. Since the beginning of the year, the Bloomberg United States home builders index, which includes the largest construction companies, has fallen nearly 30 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in new construction last month was helped by the continuing surge of building in the West, where new construction jumped 15.8 percent from April's levels. The building rate in the South also posted an 8.5 percent gain from April. Housing starts were up only marginally in the Northeast and fell 15.8 percent in the Midwest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also showed strong growth in the construction of apartments, a sign that high interest rates are beginning to affect the housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As interest rates start to rise, particularly mortgage rates, it becomes more expensive to purchase a home,'' said Bernard Baumohl, executive director of the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, N.J.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as purchases of single-family homes slow, so does the economy, he said. ''Does the continued strength in apartment building bode well for real estate and the economy? Not quite.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government report showed a 25.4 percent increase since April in the construction of structures with five units or more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's housing report was the latest to suggest a slowdown. On Monday, a survey of home builders found their collective view of the current business climate at the lowest level since 1995.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Federal Reserve also cautioned that the housing market appeared to be cooling. In its Beige Book report, the Fed said that building had slowed in most regions and that too many homes were being built in some regions.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE smoke may have cleared from the last of the Memorial Day barbecues, but two months into the second quarter, many New Yorkers are still hazy about the state of the local real estate market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate professionals say that many people have the money and desire to buy, but they are waiting on the sidelines, feeling skittish about the economy and confused by housing reports that take the temperature of the nation rather than of individual markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some concerns may be well-founded. Inventory -- the number of properties on the market -- in Manhattan is up 67 percent for May 2006 over May 2005, according to Jonathan J. Miller, president of the Miller Samuel appraisal firm. Co-op inventory is up 53 percent and condominium inventory is up 87 percent, he said, adding that the condo figure is mainly attributable to new development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, apartments are staying on the market longer. In the first quarter, the average was 138 days, according to Miller Samuel. It is now approaching 150 days, Mr. Miller estimated, adding that he thinks that a lot of the inventory is overpriced.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, high-end multimillion-dollar properties are selling well. Pamela Liebman, the president and chief executive of the Corcoran Group, predicted there will be records this year on the number of sales above $20 million. Mr. Miller said he was struck by the number of transactions so far this year that are above $5 million, which he attributes mainly to residual Wall Street bonus money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, sales have been stronger since the end of 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We took a real shellacking through January,'' said Neil Binder, a principal at Bellmarc Realty. ''Now things are moving along O.K. From January on, there's been a considerable degree of constancy.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this quarter, which began on April 1, those most affected by the market are the people who are first-time home buyers or those just barely able to afford to buy. Because of rising mortgage rates, these would-be buyers (the kind who made up a good part of buyers in the real estate frenzy of the past few years) are often now renting instead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's been a tremendous surge in people signing leases,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Landlords, especially in new buildings, are ratcheting up rates and reducing enticements almost as fast.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upturn in the rental market makes sense, he said, because mortgage rates and rental demand correlate almost directly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike other markets, New York has always been somewhat insulated because of the range of buyers it attracts, from foreigners looking for pieds-a-terre to the superrich to artists and dancers with songs in their hearts and little cash in their pockets. Of course, if too many people become so fearful of a slowdown that they stop buying, they could create a self-fulfilling prophecy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The biggest unknown is what's going to happen with inflation,'' said Gregory Heym, the chief economist for Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens, adding that when it comes to interest rates, it is not so much the amount that they go up, but what an increase symbolizes. ''As they creep toward 7 percent, it has an effect on the psyche of both buyers and sellers,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Binder of Bellmarc Realty pointed out that interest rates have not increased precipitously. ''You can still get an excellent rate,'' he said. ''I remember when interest rates were 16 percent and we were doing a hell of a business.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wild card right now, he said, is new construction, which developers seek to sell at a premium. (Mr. Binder estimates that premium to be 15 to 25 percent over resales.) ''A lot of this new construction stuff is going to have a daunting time,'' he said, adding that new condominiums can make resales look comparatively affordable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several new luxury condominiums are selling well, though as Ms. Liebman said, some ''have taken off like crazy'' while others ''are floundering.'' Basically, sales are inconsistent and properties that lack the essential combination of location, amenities and attractive price will not sell.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of scaling back seem to be manifesting themselves more in second homes and vacation rentals than in primary residences, according to Mr. Binder. ''That's were the line is being drawn,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a 48-unit development in the Berkshires, in Massachusetts, where he owns a condo, he said there has not been a sale all year. ''I'm trying to sell a place,'' he said. ''I've owned it for 20 years and I'm going to own it for another 10, whether I want to or not.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marketers are spending more money now than in years past in an attempt to capture the attention of buyers who continue to exhibit zero tolerance for overpriced properties. Some sellers, however, have yet to come to terms with that.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're starting to see a little more realistic pricing, but it still has a long way to go,'' Mr. Miller said, adding that sellers were buoyed by the spring market and are more likely to adjust prices this summer. ''I think that's where you're going to see more accurate pricing,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like some other real estate companies, Corcoran enjoyed a strong spring, and it also reported the most gross sales volume in its history during March. But the number of transactions dropped 6 percent from April 2005 to April 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some people do not think the economy is as healthy as others have painted it, Mr. Heym is optimistic that New York's economy will grow, that schools will continue to improve and that the crime rate will further decline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's still such a strong desire for homeownership in this country,'' he said. ''People want to own something tangible that doesn't disappear overnight. Like Enron stock.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STONE HARBOR -- OF all the possible business investments over the last decade, real estate at the Jersey Shore has been among the rosiest. While this is still largely true, real estate brokers say they have noticed an odd twist this season: extravagant houses in the $5 million to $10 million range are moving quickly, but sales of midpriced housing have slowed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes you don't know when a market is changing until it actually happens,'' said Ron Soldano, an agent with James C. Otton Real Estate in Stone Harbor. ''Suddenly, those meat-and-potatoes properties in Avalon and Stone Harbor, those that go for between $1 million and $2 million, these are just lying fallow.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market is still strong for the most exclusive homes at the beach, according to Mr. Soldano, the mini-estates that walkers see when they look up from the sand, seaweed and driftwood just past the dunes in towns like Avalon, Stone Harbor, Mantoloking, Harvey Cedars and Loveladies. People who can spend $6 million or $7 million are still spending it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is word that a property in Avalon went for $9 million in cash,'' he said. ''That person is clearly not worried about rising gasoline prices.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two islands north from Mr. Soldano, Mark Grimes, a broker with Ocean City Realty and who grew up on the island, is seeing the same trend.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the oceanfront and the bay are holding up really well,'' Mr. Grimes said. ''But I would say that four-bedroom, two-bath place a couple of blocks in from the ocean, the ones that were appreciating so rapidly in recent years, those are not going so well.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in general have always been a little lower in Ocean City than in Stone Harbor and Avalon, but Mr. Grimes said that a four-bedroom, two-bath house was selling for $700,000 to $900,000 last year, and would probably bring that again this year, if a seller were patient.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What I see in that range is that prices are the same as in 2005, but some people thought they would go up and up again, so they have priced them too high,'' he said, noting that last year, his office had 600 to 700 listings at this time, but now has about 1,400. ''We just had some really great years. Now this is back to normal. People who are greedy won't get what they ask for. People who are reasonable will still find buyers, but it is definitely slower in that midrange category.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is that strange upside-down market at the Shore that is unusual, though. Joel Naroff, the chief economist for Commerce Bank, whose headquarters are in Cherry Hill, said that there is anecdotal evidence that high-end homes inland are not doing so well, while midpriced homes are continuing their hot pace of recent years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of course, it's hard to know what is midlevel anymore in New Jersey,'' Mr. Naroff said. ''Some people would say that $750,000 is a midlevel house these days in many parts of New Jersey, and that is about the price we see being stalled, but I would still consider that quite high.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are scattered discussions of Realtors saying they are having trouble selling, but it just may be that things were so good for so long that this is a normal pulling back. It is possible that high-end buyers are just holding on to their properties right now, and those few who are buying are buying second homes at the Shore.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farther north, where a lot of the Shore towns have more year-round residents than in the south, the trend appears to be similar, with high-priced homes on or near the ocean still selling well. The catch may be, according to Gwen Pastorelli, an agent for Mary Holder Real Estate, that high-end sellers are more savvy in the first place.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people have waited out the boom and still see that their neighbors are getting $3 million to $5 million for something they paid a couple-hundred thousand for some years ago and are willing to cash out, but are not in a hurry,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those people, Ms. Pastorelli said, are willing to spruce up their houses so they show well. ''They are willing to take the time and effort to pull up the dirty carpet, splash some new paint on the walls, fix up the garden. People who just want to flip a property that they bought on the cheap won't do that, so those houses aren't selling now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said, too, that developers who are putting up grand new homes are getting sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At the Shore, people seem to want new,'' she said. ''They don't want to put up with fixing. Developers are smart enough to build a big new Victorian-looking home to fit in, say, in Ocean Grove, and they are getting their price, while the older, more inexpensive one may not.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it is not like anyone with Jersey Shore real estate is about to land in the poorhouse any time soon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Little condos in decent areas are going from $429,000 to $1 million,'' said Jo Ann Lo Duca, of HCH Realty in Harvey Cedars, on the northern end of Long Beach Island. ''A $799,000 house a block from the main road here was considered a teardown. We're seeing things selling for $7.9 million in some cases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even if people say some things are slowing down, it's still pretty amazing. Prices of air fares are going up, even bread is going up. I think that soon the number of buyers will catch up with the sellers in the middle class. I wouldn't wait around for prices to go down.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME builders in the United States are finally turning pessimistic, or at least that is what they say. The National Association of Home Builders reported this week that its monthly survey showed more pessimism than at any time since 1995. And the next day the government reported that housing starts in April were down 7 percent from March.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing start numbers can be volatile, however, and the number the government focuses on is a seasonally adjusted annual rate, which would be fine if weather did not have a way of distorting the statistics. So all that pessimism may yet prove to be false.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the housing boom is finally nearing an end, it is clear from the accompanying charts, showing regional activity in both apartment and single-family home construction, that it was an unusual boom. The 2001 recession had only a mild impact on apartment building and did not dent single-family construction. After it ended, the market took off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of the Northeast, where condominium and cooperative apartments remain strong, it was also a boom with declining interest in multifamily housing, which includes everything from duplexes to large apartment buildings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The charts show actual starts over 12-month periods ended in the dates shown. The figures show the change over each 12-month period from the entire year of 1997 -- a period when housing starts were already relatively high.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As can be seen, the strongest growth in single-family homes since then came in the South and West regions, with the recent 12-month totals more than 60 percent higher than the 1997 figures. In the other two regions, the gain has been less than 30 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In multifamily housing, the boom was in the Northeast, where the volume of starts peaked earlier this year at more than double the 1997 level. In the Midwest, apartment starts were down sharply, while they are running very close to 1997 levels in the other two regions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, that reflects a trend toward single-family housing. The record for annual housing starts in the United States is 2.36 million, set in the 12 months ended in November 1972. In that period, 44 percent of the starts were multifamily units; construction in that category was set to plunge in the recession that began a year later. Three years later, multifamily starts were down more than 75 percent from the peak.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The peak 12 months of this boom, through March of this year, had just 2.09 million starts. But only 17 percent of them were multifamily units, while single-family starts set records.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The speculative fervor back in the early 1970's was in apartments being financed by real estate investment trusts. This time it was in single-family homes, some of them being bought by investors seeking quick profits by flipping homes they financed with innovative mortgages that had not been thought of during previous booms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will this boom end as badly for those speculators as the early-1970's one did for the real estate investment trusts, some of which went broke? Stay tuned.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By CONRAD DE AENLLE  </div><div>490 words</div><div>14 May 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEDERAL Reserve policy makers indicated last week that data on the housing market and on the economy's use of vital resources would influence their decisions on interest rates. Several reports scheduled for Tuesday should supply crucial information on both fronts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two indicators of strength in the housing market are expected to provide a cloudy picture. Housing starts are estimated in a Bloomberg News poll of economists to have edged down to an annual rate of 1.95 million units in April, from 1.960 million in March, while a dip is foreseen in building permits, to an annual rate of 2.040 million units, from 2.094 million units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mixed signals are anticipated in manufacturing data for April to be released the same morning. Industrial production is forecast to have risen 0.5 percent, down from 0.6 percent the month before. Capacity utilization, the proportion of the nation's factories that are humming along, is projected to have risen to 81.5 percent, from 81.3 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Michael Williams, a strategist for Tocqueville Asset Management, adds up all the figures, he finds no ambiguity at all. The economy is progressing better than many believe, in his opinion, and he thinks the Fed is far from finished.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's nothing to suggest that those numbers are going to be negative,'' Mr. Williams said of the releases this week. ''We continue to believe it's not all over on the rate hike side. I don't think the numbers are going to give them a reason to run for the exits and stop.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He does not expect an increase at the next meeting, he said, but he predicted two more before the year is out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Fed may pause, but I think there will be more rate hikes because the economy, in many ways, is actually accelerating,'' Mr. Williams said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what happens to stocks if the reports this week are benign? ''In a perverse way, maybe the market will sell off,'' he predicted. ''If we get good housing numbers, the market will sell off in a second.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Williams is bullish on stocks for the long term, but Wall Street is ''voting for a slowdown so the Fed will stop raising rates,'' he said. ''There's a real negative psychology burned into the place now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DATA WATCH -- As if the housing and manufacturing reports were not enough to occupy the minds of traders, data on April producer prices will also be announced on Tuesday. The latest spike in energy prices is expected to have resulted in a 0.8 percent increase in producer prices, according to the Bloomberg poll. After factoring out food and energy costs, a much tamer 0.2 percent rise is forecast.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in Business Day on Tuesday about a slowing in the market for home sellers misstated the original list price of a house owned by Dan Marr in San Rafael, Calif. It was $1.045 million, not $1.45 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Thu May 11 2006   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Americans who planned on real estate as their path to wealth are beginning to find that there are limits to how high is up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blame market forces. As higher interest rates dampen demand in cities and suburbs that only a year ago were battlegrounds for fierce bidding wars among numerous buyers, sellers are grudgingly lowering their prices to drum up interest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A house at 57 Marina Boulevard in San Rafael, in Marin County north of San Francisco, was originally listed at $1.45 million. The owner recently dropped the price to $949,000 when a competing house on the same street lowered its price to $959,000, from $989,000. In the county, the prices of about a quarter of all listings have been reduced. County records show that 57 Marina Boulevard was sold in February for $700,000, so the owner, Dan Marr, is unlikely to lose money even at the lower price, though he may not make as much as he had hoped. ''I don't want to talk about it,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is getting tough out there for sellers. What is happening in Marin County is being repeated in cities and suburbs across the United States. Nearly a year after the sales of homes peaked, buyers are wresting control from sellers in many areas as inventories of unsold homes have grown, in some markets doubling. Few people are losing money after the run-up in housing prices in the last 10 years, but the air is coming out of the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a slow leak, to be sure. The most widely used statistic to measure home values, the median home price, shows that once-hot markets like San Mateo, Calif., and Mercer County, N.J., are now registering year-over-year declines. In general, prices are still climbing, but they are doing so far more slowly in cities like Las Vegas and San Diego, which had been lucrative markets for speculators.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going from a seller's market to a buyer's market,'' said David Lereah, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. In March, ''price appreciation went down to 7.4 percent, from over 10 percent,'' he added. ''That most probably reflects that sellers are bringing their prices down.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As always, real estate remains intensely local and sellers have retained, or regained, control in some markets, because there are fewer properties to be had and demand is being bolstered by stronger job markets. Even in markets with growing inventories like Chicago, the situation is not uniformly weak in all neighborhoods.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ZipRealty, the discount real estate broker, has found widespread price reductions in the multiple listing services used by all agents to advertise homes. Prices have been trimmed on 35.7 percent of all homes currently listed for sale in the Boston area, for example. The same is true for homes in San Diego, Sacramento, Los Angeles and Miami. And prices have been snipped on a quarter of the homes in Chicago, Washington and Baltimore.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Silicon Valley, where jobs are coming back after the collapse of the technology bubble, Richard Calhoun, a real estate agent, said that the number of homes sold was now 85 percent of the 25-year average. A year ago, it was 30 percent above that average. In Santa Cruz, inventories have tripled to 124 days, from 42 days.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A result is that the median price of homes in San Mateo County dropped 2.7 percent, to $875,000, in March, from $899,000 a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's clearly a slowdown,'' Mr. Calhoun, the Silicon Valley agent, said. ''But how can you complain when more than 50 percent of sellers are getting more than their asking price and when you have only two months of inventory when in other places four to six months is considered normal?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, for the first time in nearly a decade, you can smell the anxiety. The listing agent for a four-bedroom home on Scripps Trail in San Diego informed other agents in the multiple-listing service that a ''very, very motivated seller will entertain all reasonable offers'' and ''will help with closing costs.'' The house was listed in September at $810,000. After a previous price cut, the seller is now willing to entertain offers as low as $685,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller bought the house for $730,000 in 2005, according to county property records, for what the listing agent said were investment purposes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking a loss is still rare for sellers, because homes appreciated so much in the 1990's and 2000's. Stephen and Brenda Abelkop bought their four-bedroom house in La Jolla, Calif., for around $850,000 about 15 years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they put it up for sale right after Thanksgiving, they followed their agent's advice to ask for $2.75 million. ''You price it for the market,'' Mr. Abelkop said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they didn't attract much interest. Inventories in the San Diego area have risen 25 percent in the last year, to more than 19,000 unsold homes, a record. So there is a lot more competition, even for a high-end property like the Abelkops' house, which has sweeping views of San Diego Bay. They recently dropped the price to a range of $2.5 million to $2.7 million and said the drop had resulted in more buyer visits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some agents say setting price ranges attracts buyers who would otherwise walk away thinking the home was too expensive. Others say it is simply a sign of a wavering owner.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because sellers are not panicking, it appears unlikely that the real estate market will fall abruptly. ''Sellers remain optimistic,'' said Edward Leamer, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leamer sees some evidence that the bubble is deflating slowly, but says he finds it striking that it has taken so long. For example, sales volume peaked in the San Diego area in the summer of 2003. Only in January did inventories begin to swell, hitting an eight-month supply of homes that month, and sellers began to get nervous enough to bring the prices down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories have since moved closer to a six-month supply of homes, which balances the volume between buyer and seller.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PMI, a company that tracks risk in the real estate market for mortgage lenders, said the chances were increasing that prices in San Diego would decline in the next two years. The company said the city had a 60 percent chance of a decline, up from 52.8 percent last summer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in most of California and the Boston-to-New York corridor could also fall, said Mark Milner, the company's chief risk officer. Its statistics, which lag the current market by about two months, show homes continuing to appreciate, but at a slower rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After open houses for their four-bedroom, two-story ranch house in Lawrenceville, N.J., brought in no offers, Mary Ellen and Anthony Pierrard are telling potential buyers they are willing to negotiate their $420,000 asking price and are even considering enlisting a real estate agent to help them market their home. That's a far cry from the couple's experience selling two houses on their own in Rockland County, N.Y., a few years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''During the first open house for both, we received a minimum two to three offers,'' Mrs. Pierrard, a corporate employee relations manager, said. ''We sold them on the first day. Now, no one is even making an offer, period.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robin L. McCarthy, a real estate agent who works in nearby Princeton, N.J., said homes were sitting on the market three to four months, when houses sold in as little as a few days a year ago. Houses that would have been the subject of intense bidding wars now sell for slightly less than asking price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buyers are afraid that real estate prices are going to go down, so they are very careful,'' Ms. McCarthy said. ''They don't want to pay too much.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus far, prices have not fallen in any of the 375 largest American cities tracked by the PMI Group. But many are showing a sharp deceleration in price increases, among them Las Vegas, San Diego, Elmira, N.Y., and Lebanon, Pa.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, those cities are outnumbered by cities where prices are drastically accelerating -- like St. George, Utah; Binghamton, N.Y.; Boise, Idaho; Naples, Fla.; and most cities in Arizona.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'd expect a soft landing in prices because, naturally, the economy is strong,'' Mr. Milner said. Unless a recession hits and people begin to lose jobs, house prices will fall slowly, most economists say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new home business, large builders like Toll Brothers and Hovnanian Enterprises report that orders have fallen 4 percent to 29 percent but that average selling prices are still rising, albeit more slowly than six months ago. Nationally, however, the Commerce Department reported that median new-home prices -- half the homes sold for more, half for less -- fell 2.2 percent, to $224,200, in March from a year ago. It was the first year-over-year price decline since February 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories are not high in every city. For a variety of reasons, mostly stronger job markets, sales and prices are picking up in markets like Houston, Boise and Dallas, which did not see a boom in recent years, experts say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Seattle, for instance, some buyers are enmeshed in bidding wars that push prices far beyond the asking price -- a phenomenon that was common in San Diego, Las Vegas and Washington only a year ago. Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a new online real estate service based in Seattle, has hired a champion video gamer, with great thumb-twitching skill, to speed data entry during the multioffer auctions. ''Polite, soggy Seattleites have become blood-thirsty cannibals,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston appears to be benefiting from strength in the energy industry, robust hiring and transplants from Louisiana. More than 100,000 hurricane evacuees are living in the city and its suburbs. Clint Simpson of Greenwood King Properties said that in the last month he had represented four home buyers who were relocating to Houston because their companies were scaling back operations in New Orleans.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Houses are getting multiple offers the first week on the market and many of them are going over list,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, sales of existing homes were up 22 percent from a year earlier and median prices rose 5.4 percent, to $143,310, according to the Houston Association of Realtors. Inventories fell by nearly 3 percent in the month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Formerly hot coastal markets and previously flat markets in the middle of the country have reversed their roles, said Mr. Lereah, from the Realtors association.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chicago, real estate agents say each neighborhood is different. A high-rise building boom has created a glut of condos downtown and buyers can often negotiate free parking spaces, which previously would have cost $35,000. But the pickings are so slim in the popular Lakeview area north of the central business district that an agent, Brad Lipitz, recently found only three listings there. ''Chicago is comprised of many markets,'' he noted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Southern Florida, agents and sellers say sales have slackened as inventories have ballooned, but they note that prices are not falling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donna L. Lanzon sold her late mother's two-bedroom condo in Deerfield Beach in Broward County in March. The condo was initially priced at $250,000, but Ms. Lanzon reduced the asking price to $235,000 and sold the 1,260-square-foot, two-bedroom unit for $225,000 after three months on the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her agent, Cathleen Flanagan, who works for ZipRealty, said the growing inventory -- the Fort Lauderdale area had more than 20,000 homes for sale at the end of April, more than four times the level a year ago -- had forced sellers to rethink their asking prices and offer incentives, like increasing the commission of the buyer's agent to 4 percent, instead of following the usual practice of splitting a 6 percent commission between buyer's and seller's agents. One seller recently offered a free five-night Caribbean cruise for two.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do the tactics work? ''Absolutely; it makes sense,'' Ms. Flanagan said. ''A lot of buyers' agents will go out there to see the home.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN 2005, the least-affordable place in the country to live, measured by the percentage of income devoted to mortgage payments, was Salinas, Calif.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second was the Santa Cruz-Watsonville area of California.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third? Santa Rosa-Petaluma, Calif.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, California has the distinction of having the 11 least-affordable metropolitan areas in the country. One would need to go all the way down to 12th place -- and across the country to the New York region's northern suburbs -- to find a non-California metropolitan area on the least-affordable list of 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of California is pretty. It has beaches and the mountains and, of course, the weather. But why are places like Salinas, which is surrounded by agriculture, topping places like Honolulu (No. 17) and Miami (No. 22) on the out-of-reach list?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no one answer, but demographers and public planners who study such trends say that a confluence of factors in California -- both artificial and natural -- have combined to create a particularly acute problem.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''California has both political and geographical constraints on building,'' said Dowell Myers, professor of policy, planning and development at the University of Southern California. ''That drives up prices, and then it snowballs.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The geographical limits on developable land are the hills and the coast, while the political restrictions are state and local regulations that prevent building new homes, in response to both environmental and congestion concerns.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the key factors here is the basic law of supply and demand,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''California is in marked contrast to Florida, where you can expand without constraint. It's more like the New York suburbs, where too many dollars are chasing too few homes.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many states have regulations on growth, California is a leader, Dean Hughes says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California is also in the forefront of population growth, but it is not driven, as might be expected, by envious Easterners and Midwesterners escaping snowbound winters. Nor is it driven by long-term Californians. In fact, census figures show that over the past decade, more people have left California -- emigrating to neighboring states like Nevada and Arizona and farther away, to Texas and Florida -- than have moved in from other parts of the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The population increase is driven primarily by births and foreign immigration. According to census statistics, from April 2000 to July 2005, California experienced a net natural increase -- taking into account births and deaths -- of 1.5 million people.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And an additional 1.4 million moved in from other countries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While California's birth rate is not the highest in the nation -- Utah's is -- it is near the top.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New York has the constraints but doesn't have the population growth,'' Professor Myers said. ''Florida has the population growth but doesn't have the constraints.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it is difficult to build new houses in California, that isn't to say none are going up. According to the California Association of Realtors, there have been increases in the number of housing units built over the past nine years -- from 94,283 in 1996 to 207,154 in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is substantially more than the low in 1993, when California was in the throes of a severe economic recession and only 84,656 units were built. But it's not as prolific as in 1988, when 255,559 went up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a number of reasons for the restraints on home building, including the fact that many desirable areas in the state are already ''built out'' and the permit process is more complex and drawn out now than it was a few decades ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the Realtors group, said the state needs about 250,000 units a year to meet housing demand. ''We've been below that every year over the past 10 years,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high demand and low supply created a perfect breeding ground for investors and speculators, which became ''the last straw'' in driving housing prices up, said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another quintessentially California issue is Proposition 13, the 1978 measure that slashed property taxes by more than 50 percent and ignited a national property tax revolution.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure, which was supposed to facilitate home buying, has backfired to some extent; local governments prefer that land be used for retailing rather than housing because they collect more from sales taxes than from property taxes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Proposition 13 is a big stop sign saying 'no housing needed,' '' said Peter Dreier, professor of public policy at Occidental College in Los Angeles and an author of ''Place Matters: Metropolitics for the 21st Century'' (University Press of Kansas, 2001). ''Every municipality is engaged in a bidding war for retail -- they're battling for Wal-Mart, to keep the libraries open.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unlikely that will change, Professor Dreier and others say, calling Proposition 13 ''the third rail of government -- it's untouchable.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it is no surprise that house prices have gone through the roof in places like Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, what is more unexpected is that less-popular areas away from the coast are also topping the list of least-affordable places to live.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a huge movement away from L.A. County and from San Francisco and the great beneficiary is the Inland Empire'' in Southern California, and in Sacramento and points east in northern California, said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The migration is happening both among high-skilled and middle-class residents, as well as low-skilled and lower-class ones, so the cost of housing is exploding even in areas of the state that most people do not think of as traditionally expensive, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Baby boomers are getting older and moving into the higher-income bracket and into the top-dollar markets,'' Professor Myers said. ''Immigrants have high ownership rates at the bottom of the market. It's a recipe for a bubble.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These noncoastal communities are no longer simply attached to established cities, but in many cases have become job centers in their own right, Ms. Appleton-Young said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Inland Empire, made up of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, has been in a 30-year transition from a bedroom suburb to a metropolitan area, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are now working where they live,'' Ms. Appleton-Young said. ''It's not a commuter area.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Joaquin Valley, in central California, on the other hand, still has a way to go to attract an educated work force and to create a diverse and thriving economy. But Ms. Appleton-Young said it appears to be following in the footsteps of the Inland Empire: ''As we say, jobs follow housing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final paradox in this state of paradoxes is that traditionally, many Californians are not homeowners; the state ranks 48th, behind only New York and Hawaii, in terms of homeownership, and about 10 percent below the national average. But over the past several years, even as housing prices have increased, more people are buying.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales climbed fairly steadily from 1996 through 2005, with only a slight downward blip in 2001, said the California Realtors' association.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hans Johnson, a demographer with the nonprofit Public Policy Institute of California, said, ''It's counterintuitive.'' But apparently typical. Those familiar with home-purchasing trends say that people buy when the market is going up, not when it is going down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If houses are so costly, how are people managing to make the leap and become homeowners?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, they use methods of financing that were not previously available, Mr. Johnson said. Instead of fixed-rate 30-year mortgages, they take, for example, variable-rate interest-only loans, which have lower monthly payments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, he said, homeowners are paying far more on mortgages than the 30 percent of income recommended by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 40 percent of all households in California, the most anywhere, exceeded this recommended threshold. ''In some cases, they're even paying more than half,'' Mr. Johnson said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homeowners are buying smaller homes or condominiums; according to the study, only 15 percent of long-term homeowners in California live in multifamily housing units, like condominiums, while 26 percent of recent buyers do.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In some ways it's good, because people own a house and have equity,'' he said. ''In other ways it's bad,'' he explained, because ''if interest rates go up, there will be a large increase in monthly rates.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If there's a bubble that bursts or slowly leaks,'' he added, overextended owners may not be able to sell and recover enough to pay off the loan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Dreier of Occidental College said he also blamed state government and business leaders for failing to support the creation of moderate-priced housing -- not just for low-income residents, but also for middle-class people, like teachers and nurses, who cannot buy into the overheated housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he was a city official in Boston, the state government, businessmen and bankers ''understood that affordable housing was part of a healthy work force,'' Professor Dreier said. ''In California, businesses and the Chambers of Commerce have not embraced housing issues like they have embraced other issues, such as health care. We won't see the political will to solve the housing crisis until the organized business community weighs in and says it's unacceptable.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big question now is whether the housing market will deflate while the economy stays strong, which would enable more Californians to buy. The answer seems as elusive as predicting the next earthquake.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The signs point toward a slowdown: interest rates are going up, and investors and speculators, who drove up prices by buying and selling houses, seem to be pulling back in hot markets nationally. But everyone, even those who study the subject, knows it is dangerous to predict.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask Professor Myers of U.S.C., who sold his house in Los Angeles last year. ''I was convinced it was going to peak,'' he said. ''After I sold, it rose another 15 percent.''  </p>

</div><div>AP</div>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA, May 5 -- Toll Brothers, the builder of luxury homes, said on Friday that signed contracts for its homes fell 29 percent in the second quarter and that home deliveries for the year would be 200 lower than expected as the housing market began to slow.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After five years of explosive growth, the housing market is in the grip of a slowdown prompted by rising mortgage rates and higher inventories.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's pretty much what we had thought,'' said William Mack, a home building analyst for Standard &amp; Poor's. ''Things are slowing and at a pretty rapid rate.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But shares of Toll Brothers and other home builders rose yesterday because a weaker-than-projected jobs report for April was seen on Wall Street as giving the Federal Reserve less incentive to raise interest rates. That would slow the rise of mortgage rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales of new homes rose 13.8 percent nationally in March, the median price of homes sold dipped 2.2 percent as builders cut prices. Sales of existing homes edged up in March, but the backlog of unsold homes hit a record high, according to the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Toll Brothers, whose well-heeled customers are less vulnerable to economic winds, is not immune.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the second quarter, Toll said signed contracts came in at $1.56 billion, down from last year's $2.2 billion. Its backlog rose 3 percent to $6.07 billion from $5.87 billion in 2005. The biggest declines in signed contracts were on the East Coast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll predicted it would deliver 9,000 to 9,700 homes in fiscal 2006, a decline of 200 homes from its previous outlook.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other home builders are feeling the pinch as well.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Hovnanian Enterprises lowered its outlook for the second quarter and the year. Hovnanian cited cancellations, slowing sales, higher material costs and increased concessions and incentives.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another builder, the Centex Corporation, recently said its new orders fell 11 percent in the fourth quarter. The company also scaled down its earnings forecast for 2007. Pulte Homes and Beazer Homes USA also said new orders fell during the quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll Brothers attributed the drop in contracts and deliveries to fewer speculative buyers, more cancellations from nonspeculative buyers and weaker demand from those worried about the direction of home prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cancellation rate over the quarter was 8.5 percent, higher than Toll's historic average of about 7 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Speculative buyers are no longer fueling demand,'' said Robert I. Toll, the company's chairman and chief executive. ''Instead, they're putting the homes they've recently acquired back on the market or are canceling contracts in midconstruction.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is not slowing as fast as economists expected, according to a report yesterday, but some say the data suggest a more pronounced contraction in the next few months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report that carried mixed signals, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes edged up last month, the number of homes for sale rose markedly and prices increased more slowly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes, which make up about 85 percent of all homes sold, increased 0.3 percent in March, to an annual pace of 6.92 million. That was higher than the 6.9 million pace in February and the 6.57 million pace in January but lower than the 6.97 million pace in March 2005. Sales were up in the Northeast and Midwest but dropped slightly in the West and South.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expected sales to fall to a pace of 6.66 million, according to a survey by Bloomberg News.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median selling price -- half the homes sold for more and half for less -- was $218,000, up 7.4 percent from a year earlier. The increase was smaller than the 9.5 percent gain in February and the 11.7 percent increase in January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes on the market rose 7 percent, to 3.2 million. At the current sales pace, that amounts to a 5.8-month supply, up from 5.5 months in February and four months in March 2005. Economists say the rising number of homes on the market makes it harder for sellers to demand higher prices, as buyers take advantage of greater choice and their increased bargaining power.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bidding fever that was present a year or so ago has all but disappeared, and that's another sign that this market is slowing,'' said Anthony Chan, chief economist at J. P. Morgan's private client services group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting late last year, buyers and sellers of homes, particularly in the East and West Coast markets, appeared to be staring each other down. Many buyers, sensing a slowdown coming, said they were holding out for a better deal, while sellers, believing they still controlled the market, refused to cut their prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in sales in February and March indicate that the standoff is easing as sellers cut asking prices to lure buyers, economists said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate speculators in particular were affected, said David Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors. In many Florida and California cities, he said, investors who bought condominiums and other property in a bid to make a quick profit are scrambling to unload them as interest rates rise. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.32 percent in March, up from 6.25 percent in February. ''They are all leaving at once, particularly in Miami and Naples and some of the California markets,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah said the small sales increases in the last two months were temporary. ''Interest rates have gone up and we will see sales come down a little more,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Conference Board said that consumer confidence rose to its highest level since May 2002 as Americans felt more optimistic about the job market. The index registered 109.6 this month, up from 107.5 in March.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INVESTORS will examine measures of retail and wholesale prices this week for signs of rising inflation, but they may scrutinize a couple of reports on the housing market even more closely.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Inflation is more important in the big picture,'' said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services, ''but housing is more volatile, and we're in a position now where the housing sector is a bit on the cusp.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are signs that it's weakening,'' he added, ''but then we keep getting strong numbers.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers on the calendar this week, both on Tuesday, cover housing starts and building permits for March. A Bloomberg News poll of economists expects declines in both.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts are estimated to have run at an annual rate of 2.03 million units, down from 2.12 million in February. Permits, an indicator of the market's health further in the future because they relate to activity yet to begin, are projected to slip to an annual rate of 2.10 million units for March, versus 2.179 million the month before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One culprit in the slowdown is higher mortgage rates, Mr. Cheney said, but it is only a minor one.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From a long-term perspective, rates aren't that bad,'' he said. ''As long as the overall economy keeps generating jobs and income growth, it will outweigh the negative effect of rising mortgage rates.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices are a thornier problem. They have soared for years, and he pointed to signs that the advance might be stalling along with building activity. In some metropolitan areas, he noted, home price ''appreciation has slowed down, if not ground down to a halt.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concern among economists and investors is that as housing goes, so goes the economy. ''Some say the housing market will crash and take the economy down with it,'' Mr. Cheney said, ''but I think that fear is exaggerated.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet it is not completely out of line, he conceded. A slowdown in housing, he said, ''will cut into the ability of consumers to take out new equity and spend it on Ferraris.'' One indication that fewer Testarossas may be leaving the showroom, and that fewer traders will be inclined to buy stocks on Tuesday, would be a decline in housing starts or permits to below an annual rate of two million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That would feed into the story that there's a sharp correction and not the mild one that I'm expecting,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''If we start getting numbers starting with a '1,' it will start to get people's attention.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DATA WATCH -- The forecast for core producer and consumer prices for March is for a sharp increase in yawns.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The era of cheap money may finally be nearing its end.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors pushed up the yield on the government's benchmark note to over 5 percent on Thursday, its highest point in nearly four years and a signal that many borrowers will soon be paying more on mortgages and home equity loans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driven by a stronger economy and a nearly two-year money-tightening campaign by the Federal Reserve, the rising level of interest rates across the board is expected to have the biggest impact on people who took out home loans with low introductory interest rates that are set to adjust in line with market rates in the next few years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year Treasury note, which crossed the 5 percent threshold yesterday for the first time since June 2002, serves as a touchstone for a variety of borrowers, from consumers to corporations and governments. But it is most closely tied to mortgages and is likely to play a role in slowing home price increases and curbing the home-buying frenzy in many parts of the country.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Where you are going to feel the pain the most is on the housing market,'' said Brian J. Carlin, a vice president at J. P. Morgan Private Bank.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carlin estimated that recent homebuyers with adjustable rate mortgages could experience a jump in interest rates of 3 to 4 percentage points in the next two years, as the typical 3 percent introductory rate is adjusted higher in annual increments. For a family with a $400,000 mortgage, that could translate into an increase of as much as $1,000 in monthly interest payments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage delinquencies have already started climbing, although they remain at relatively low levels. In the fourth quarter of last year, 4.7 percent of all home mortgages were delinquent, up from 4.4 percent in the third quarter, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. A delinquent loan is one in which monthly payments are past due for 60 days or more.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But experts note that by past standards borrowing costs still remain modest and that the recent interest rate increases may have only a limited effect on economic growth. For many Americans, the growing number of jobs and improvements in incomes are likely to outweigh the impact of higher mortgage costs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we go back six years,'' said Harold S. Woolley, a managing director at Bessemer Trust, an investment management firm based in New York, ''people thought 5 percent was a pretty low rate.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For much of the last year, analysts and policy makers have struggled to explain why long-term interest rates have remained relatively low, given the Fed's campaign to push up interest rates by increasing its benchmark short-term rate, now at 4.75 percent. Investors now expect the Fed to raise interest rates at least once more, to 5 percent, at its meeting next month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech yesterday, Donald L. Kohn, a Fed governor, said that rising interest rates were likely to slow the economy later this year, primarily by deflating the once-robust housing market. He indicated that he would favor increasing short-term rates further if the economy sharply accelerated or energy prices shot up, because both could ignite higher inflation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A tendency for inflation to move higher would put economic stability and the long-term performance of the economy at risk,'' he told bankers at a luncheon in Oklahoma City. Mr. Kohn said that inflation excluding energy and food costs had so far remained modest at about 2 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wall Street, the stock market was little changed yesterday in light trading, in part because the start of Passover this week and the Good Friday holiday led many traders to take time off.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many analysts say that longer-term interest rates in the United States have been kept low by the purchase of government securities by foreign governments and investors, particularly from Asia.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some early indications that foreign buying is easing. In the first week of April, for instance, the Japanese government purchased foreign bonds at a much slower rate than it did during the comparable period from 2003 to 2005, said Wan-Chong Kung, a senior portfolio manager at First American Funds, a mutual fund company in Minneapolis.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have seen some moderation in buying from Asia, and I think we will continue to see that,'' Ms. Kung said, noting that recent interest rate increases by central banks in Europe and Japan were conditioning investors to higher borrowing costs across the world.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mortgage Bankers Association estimates that the burden of higher interest costs would fall on about 7 percent to 8 percent of all homeowners. The rest have either paid off their mortgages or face no immediate increase because they took out fixed-rate mortgages or refinanced their earlier loans to mortgages that hold rates steady for 5 to 10 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, new homebuyers will be paying more.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average national 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate was 6.43 percent last week, up from 6.21 percent at the start of the year and 5.71 percent at the start of 2005, according to Freddie Mac. The introductory interest rate on a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage was up to 6.11 percent, from 5.78 percent in January and 5.3 percent a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Graph: ''Rates Rising''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose above 5 percent yesterday for the first time since June 2002.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS the busy spring shopping season gets under way, listings throughout Connecticut are cluttered with winter leftovers. The inventory of available houses is up almost everywhere, suggesting that sellers who want their properties to move quickly have to come to terms with a cooling market and falling consumer confidence.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are beginning to emerge in the usual numbers, but compared with the heady spring markets of recent years, they are fussier and less pressured to act quickly, said Mary Ellen Vicino, senior vice president for the Greater Hartford area offices of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pricing a house realistically is crucial in this more-competitive market, especially for properties with obvious negatives.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You've got to be right on the button now with prices,'' said Rick Higgins, chairman and founder of the Higgins Group, a real estate brokerage based in Fairfield. ''People aren't going to overpay -- they're afraid to overpay. Before, people felt, 'Well, if we overpay, we'll be O.K. in six months.' They're used to 12, 15 percent gains. Now, it's 5 percent, 6 percent.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If buyers have the jitters, however, many sellers are still hoping to be the last on their street to sell at boom-market prices. Given the relentless competition, however, entering the market at too high a price may condemn a property to weeks, or even months, of market time, its value declining as buyer interest wanes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a backlog of people waiting to buy -- they're the experts, they've seen what's out there,'' Mr. Higgins said. ''Once they pass on a house, it's obviously not worth as much.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of available houses in Fairfield County is up roughly 30 percent over last year, he said, though the amounts vary markedly from town to town. For example, Darien's inventory is up about 40 percent over a year ago, while Ridgefield's is up just 8 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some towns, the swollen inventory is partly explained by a glut of higher-end homes. In Westport, for example, 115 of the roughly 300 homes on the market earlier this month were in the $2-million-and-up range.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's huge -- that's like a year's worth of inventory,'' said Darcy Sledge, an agent with the Westport office of Prudential Connecticut Realty. ''There's a lot of new construction sitting. Buyers in that range are being very choosy, and those houses not on an ideal site are sitting a little bit longer.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, sales have slowed considerably relative to last year, although many agents said properties have begun to move more briskly in the past few weeks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sampling of town statistics compiled by Ms. Sledge showed that as of March 30, sales of single-family homes were down about 40 percent for the year in Easton and Weston, 15 percent in Norwalk, 10 percent in Westport and Wilton, and 7 percent in Fairfield.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Greater Hartford Association of Realtors reported a 15 percent rise in inventory as of the end of February, with sales down about 17 percent for the year to date. New Haven County real estate agents are seeing similar numbers, according to Frank D'Ostilio, regional vice president for Coldwell Banker.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are still up over last year, however, and multiple offers are common on well-sited houses in excellent condition.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such properties are moving ''just as fast and just as pricey as they have in the past,'' said Carole Cousins, an agent with Century 21 Landmark Properties in Ridgefield. Just recently, a ''bread-and-butter colonial'' -- Ms. Cousin's term for a traditional center-hall colonial -- in an established subdivision in Ridgefield sold for the asking price after multiple offers because, she said, ''the house was pristine.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The baths were done, the kitchen was renovated,'' she said. ''The house was immaculate.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patty Hutchinson, an agent with Kelly Associates in Darien, tells a similar story about a fairly new colonial in ''perfect condition'' that listed at $3.5 million last month. The owners listed the house on a Thursday, received three offers during the weekend open house and sold it by Sunday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several other Darien properties listed in the $3 million to $4 million range are languishing, she noted, because they are overpriced relative to the competition.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Grant, an agent with the Higgins Group, has had to lower his expectations since putting his own home in Easton on the market a little more than a month ago. ''I thought I would hit the spring market hard and there would be tons of buyers out there,'' he said. After an initial flurry of calls, however, interest has tapered off to barely a phone call a week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Grant first listed his house -- a 4,000-square-foot colonial built in 1996 on three acres -- only two comparable properties were available in Easton. He set the price at $998,900. Since then, five more properties have been listed in that range, some of them larger or newer. Mr. Grant has lowered his price to $984,000, a level at which he believes there is a window in the market without competition.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listing a house at the high end of its price range is not necessarily the way to go right now, agents said, especially if the house does not show as well as others in the same range.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cousins recommends pricing a house at the point where it becomes the best house on the market at that price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers are often blind to their own house's shortcomings, however, as was the case with the couple who recently asked Ms. Cousins to perform a market analysis of their home in Brookfield.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Ms. Cousins pulled in, she noted that the house was built down low at the base of a steep driveway. High-tension wires loomed behind the property.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Inside, they had totally redone the kitchen, and they were very proud of that,'' Ms. Cousins said. But in the living room, the view of the backyard was dominated by railroad tracks at the back of the property.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she later presented her analysis to the owners, she suggested that the house ought to be priced lower than other homes with the same number of bedrooms and square footage to make up for the low site, wires and railroad tracks. The owners ultimately rejected her analysis in favor of the higher price recommended by another agent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If that house sits on the market for a year, people will say, 'Oh, it's a bad market,''' Ms. Cousins said. ''But no, the real problem is bad pricing.''  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Apartment Prices Up Again After a Slump in Manhattan  </span>
</div><div class="author">By JOSH BARBANEL  </div><div>639 words</div><div>4 April 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaking off months of fretting over rising interest rates and bursting real estate bubbles, affluent buyers stepped up their purchases of large Manhattan apartments in the first three months of the year, pushing average sale prices above those of a year ago, according to several market reports released yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After several quarters of declining average prices and withering sales, the average sale price was reported to be $1.3 million, a 7 percent increase from the same quarter in 2005, according to one report, by the brokerage firm Prudential Douglas Elliman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the increases were far below the 25 percent to 30 percent annual increase reported the year before, brokers celebrated the new numbers as an indication of a second wind blowing in a housing market that had been buffeted by caution and anxiety.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Compared to what my friends in California and Las Vegas tell me, New York seems to be holding its own,'' said Dottie Herman, chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, president and chief executive of the Corcoran Group, said, ''It shows that the New York market, after having a lackluster fourth quarter, is back in full swing with strong numbers across the board.'' She said recent transactions logged by her firm suggested that the stronger sales trend would continue into next quarter's figures as well.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, according to sales figures provided by Prudential Douglas Elliman, the number of sales of apartments with two or more bedrooms rose 44 percent in the first quarter of this year, to 1,017 from 705 in the last quarter of 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there were some signs of caution in the figures released yesterday. Although prices were up 7 percent to 8 percent from figures reported a year ago, depending on the report, they remained below the spikes in prices reported last spring. And the inventories of unsold apartments also rose significantly, with a rising supply of new condominiums coming to the market. Hundreds of additional new or newly converted condominium apartments are due to come on the market this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each brokerage firms tracks inventory differently, but in the first quarter they showed the same trends. Prudential Douglas Elliman put the current unsold inventory of apartments at 6,904, up 60 percent from the 4,327 it reported a year ago and 16 percent from the previous quarter. Corcoran listed 9,206, more than double the 4,492 it listed a year ago, and up 10 percent from the previous quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm that prepared the Prudential Douglas Elliman report, said that when the changing mix of apartments sold is taken into account, using the average price per square foot, condo prices actually declined slightly from the previous quarter, by 4.2 percent, while co-op prices rose by 2.8 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said that looking at the numbers this way suggested that price appreciation was ''essentially flat.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now I see there being parity between buyers and sellers,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist at Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, offered a more optimistic interpretation. ''People really became confident again, and people got bonuses at the end of the year,'' he said. ''The strength continues to be there.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the second half of last year, sales of studio apartments and one-bedrooms remained strong, perhaps as buyers rushed to lock in mortgage rates, and were up this quarter as well. Although prices per square foot on smaller apartments have sharply trailed larger ones over most of the last decade, Mr. Heym's data showed that average prices on one-bedroom and studio apartments in Manhattan were both about $905 a square foot, close to the $1000 average for all apartments.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS clusters of open-house balloons bob across the suburbs of the metropolitan area, from the New Englandy enclaves of Fairfield County, Conn., to the salt-sprayed boroughs of the Jersey Shore, the question remains: whither the housing market?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone, it seems, has an answer, and those answers can be strangely contradictory and accurate at the same time. If inventory is your gauge, the market is slackening. If prices are your prism, it's still going strong.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in interviews with more than two dozen real estate agents, buyers, sellers and economists, the consensus is that the housing market in the region remains remarkably buoyant but is coming down to earth. Prices are still in the clouds, but inventory is expanding and bidding wars, once commonplace, are increasingly rare.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the boom is over, there is no bust in sight. ''It's turning,'' said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business organization. ''It's neither a buyer's nor a seller's market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers say they no longer feel pressured to make an offer the moment they step over the doorsill. (There are even isolated reports of some sellers getting lowball offers.) Brokers, meanwhile, are lecturing sellers to be more realistic about prices, and sellers are working harder to spruce up their homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A few years ago, sellers were not making their beds and leaving dishes in the sink, and buyers were still coming and buying,'' said Cindy DeRose, a sales agent for Hudson Shores Realtors in Irvington, N.Y. ''It is still a healthy market. But it has cooled down enough that sellers just have to do a little more work, frankly.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the real estate market in the New York City suburbs has long had its ups and downs. But over time, houses there have proved to be extraordinary investments because people want to be close to the city while enjoying the relative safety and good public schools the suburbs tend to offer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the pattern of contradiction in the current market seems fairly consistent from state to state, there are differences from one community to the next, with some towns appearing almost impervious to any downturn, at least for now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Anthony, a sales associate for Coldwell Banker in Mendham, called the current market ''town sensitive.'' He compared a Cape Cod in East Hanover that was first listed for $539,000 and sat on the market for 80 days with a colonial in Millburn that was listed for $775,000 and sold in two days.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anthony says he believes the market is still hot as long as three conditions are met: ''nice house, nice location and nice price.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the talk of a bubble, prices do not seem ready to collapse or even edge south, with the exception of houses whose price tags were plainly inflated. Brokers say the $1 million mark seems to be a dividing line: houses priced for less sell quickly, while houses listed for more are sitting longer and, in some cases, going for less than their list prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent statewide real estate data for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut show that housing prices continued to appreciate late last year, but at a less breathless clip than the year before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Rae D. Rosen, a senior economist and assistant vice president for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the growth rate in the price of an average house peaked at the same moment in all three states, the third quarter of 2004. New York State saw a 17 percent increase in sales prices for single-family houses, over the same quarter in 2003; Connecticut, 15 percent; and New Jersey, 18.5 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, in the last quarter of 2005, housing prices in New York rose 12.6 percent over the year before, 11.9 percent in Connecticut and 14.6 percent in New Jersey. Westchester County's fourth quarter witnessed a more modest increase of 6 percent. And some brokers say that housing prices may be leveling off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like going from 60 miles per hour to 30 miles per hour,'' Ms. Rosen said of the rise in prices. ''We're just decelerating. It looks like the market is moving away from its peak.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armed with reports of an easing market and steeped in Internet research, some buyers are heading to open houses with raised hopes, expecting to find a house or a condominium they can not only afford but also actually want to inhabit. Some are equating a softening market with falling prices; they are often disappointed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to this market,'' said Claudia DeNatale, who recently toured a lackluster three-bedroom condominium in Huntington Station listed for $425,000. ''There's been so much talk about the market changing, but I don't see anything dramatic. When you talk about a drop, it should be significant.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What many buyers do report is greater choice. Indeed, inventory -- tight as a noose since 2000 -- is up across the region, sometimes markedly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, the number of unsold houses in January stood at 23,470, a 67 percent jump from the year before. Inventory in Connecticut also rose. In Fairfield County, the number of houses for sale at the end of last year was 35 percent higher than in late 2004. Inventories in some communities (Norwalk, Easton, New Canaan and Darien) were up more than 50 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey's inventory swelled, too, up 46 percent in January over the previous year. Westchester had the least growth in the number of houses on the market, 13 percent more at the end of 2005. If you add in co-ops and condominiums, the rise in inventory was 21 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief executive of Westchester County's real estate board, P. Gilbert Mercurio, said the total number of residential properties now on the market is still less than half that of the mid-1990's. ''The real estate boom ate into the inventory in Westchester County, and it is only now starting to rebuild,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the exact inventory increases, the effect is a more relaxed home-buying environment. Kelly Sabloff has sampled both markets. In 2001, she and her husband, Matthew, relocating from Montreal, bought an expanded Cape for $515,000 in Stamford, Conn. In February, after selling it for $680,000, they moved a short distance to a center hall colonial, for which they paid $747,000. ''The big difference I noticed was the choice,'' Mrs. Sabloff said. ''Granted I was in a different price range four and a half years later. But there was a sheer volume of choice. You didn't have the pressure of, 'If you don't put an offer down, you're going to lose it.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Hanley, president-elect of the New Jersey Association of Realtors and manager of Weichert Realtors in Metuchen, agreed. ''Before, we had one home for 10 buyers,'' he said. ''Now the one buyer can look at 10 homes.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For sellers, the new market dynamic can lead to frustration. Gary Harman watched in recent years as his neighbors sold Cape Cod-style homes for more than a half-million dollars. At the end of December, he put his house, in East Hanover on the market for $539,000. None of the more than 25 people who went to see it made an offer. He then dropped the price three times, to $499,000, and late last month finally received an offer, which he accepted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had thought his house would stand out because of the abundant custom wood molding that he installed. ''The discouraging part is that when the people go through the house, they don't even take that into consideration,'' he said. ''You could have holes in the house and it wouldn't matter.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sellers are newly self-conscious about the style of their house. Contemporaries, ranches and split-levels tend to sell more slowly than traditional houses, but that is even more true in a softening market, brokers say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lori and Greg Margolis have just put their 1960's ranch in Harrison, N.Y., on the market for nearly $2.2 million. It is sizable: 4,000 square feet on one and a half acres. They have transformed the house, which Mrs. Margolis termed a ''complete 1980's abomination,'' by renovating the bathrooms and painting the rooms stark colors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, she is approaching the listing with trepidation. ''The market's not vibrant now,'' she said. ''It's a nice house, but it's a certain look. The buyers in Westchester are not eclectic. It's very conservative. This house in L.A. would be the hippest, coolest house. People here like English country.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers, for their part, are feeling the pressures of rising interest rates and limited investment potential. The first would seem to propel buyers toward a purchase, so that they can lock in what is still a desirable rate. The second factor -- the possibility that the market may be at its peak -- may suggest caution.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say buyers are responding by looking for attributes that tend to prop up a home's value over time, like good schools and attractive commutes. More buyers are taking property taxes into account, too.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ruth Chizzini, vice president and director of relocation in Westchester for Sotheby's International Realty, said that escalating property taxes in the county were deterring some. ''When you come to New York, you can live in three states, and buyers are going with value,'' she said. ''We are very impacted by taxes. I just lost a couple of $3 million customers to Connecticut.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, some towns in the region enjoy such a buzz that market shifts are not acutely felt. There is Rye, N.Y., on Long Island Sound, with top-rated schools and many old and charming houses (quite a few of them mansions -- without the ''Mc'').  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a house in the prestigious Milton Point section that was listed for $1.7 million went to a sealed bid, a more civilized take on the bidding war, when the seller's broker asks all potential buyers for their best offers and terms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Chizzini says tear-downs are still common in Rye, another sign of a superheated market: in March a builder closed on a $1.6 million house on less than a half-acre, with plans to knock it down and build anew. And two young couples were recently competing for one of Ms. Chizzini's Rye listings -- a four-bedroom split-level asking $875,000 that, in her words, ''needs everything, everything.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for every situation like that, there is one like the town house listed in late January by Carol Ann Decker, a sales associate in the office of Country Living Associates in Westport, Conn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Decker put the town house, in Fairfield, Conn., on the market for $535,000. ''We sold it instantly,'' she said. But the buyer got cold feet, she said, and failed to move forward with an inspection. Three other buyers expressed interest but faded away, Mrs. Decker said. It was not until late March that a firm offer was made and accepted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Three years ago,'' she said, ''I think it would have sold -- and stuck -- right away.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photos: Matthew and Kelly Sabloff, above, with Malkam, Oliver and Ava, in their new home in Stamford, Conn.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS clusters of open-house balloons bob across the suburbs of the metropolitan area, from the New Englandy enclaves of Fairfield County, Conn., to the salt-sprayed boroughs of the Jersey Shore, the question remains: whither the housing market?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone, it seems, has an answer, and those answers can be strangely contradictory and accurate at the same time. If inventory is your gauge, the market is slackening. If prices are your prism, it's still going strong.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in interviews with more than two dozen real estate agents, buyers, sellers and economists, the consensus is that the housing market in the region remains remarkably buoyant but is coming down to earth. Prices are still in the clouds, but inventory is expanding and bidding wars, once commonplace, are increasingly rare.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the boom is over, there is no bust in sight. ''It's turning,'' said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business organization. ''It's neither a buyer's nor a seller's market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers say they no longer feel pressured to make an offer the moment they step over the doorsill. (There are even isolated reports of some sellers getting lowball offers.) Brokers, meanwhile, are lecturing sellers to be more realistic about prices, and sellers are working harder to spruce up their homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A few years ago, sellers were not making their beds and leaving dishes in the sink, and buyers were still coming and buying,'' said Cindy DeRose, a sales agent for Hudson Shores Realtors in Irvington, N.Y. ''It is still a healthy market. But it has cooled down enough that sellers just have to do a little more work, frankly.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the real estate market in the New York City suburbs has long had its ups and downs. But over time, houses there have proved to be extraordinary investments because people want to be close to the city while enjoying the relative safety and good public schools the suburbs tend to offer.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's Up, What's Down: Prices, Sales and Inventories  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices stayed relatively strong through the end of 2005, but sales were falling in many places, and inventories were increasing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW JERSEY  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were still rising at a double-digit pace, but the increases were not as great in the hottest markets as they had been earlier in the year. Sales were declining over all in the counties closest to New York City, according to the Otteau Report, and inventories were up 58 percent in February over a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Graphs track Percentage change over prior year in Bergen, Passaic, Essex and Hudson counties.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONNECTICUT  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were increasing at double-digit rates in Fairfield, but sales dropped sharply late in the year, so inventories grew. A sampling of 12 towns around Fairfield County showed inventories at the end of 2005 ranging from 11 percent to 59 percent higher than a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Graphs track Percentage change over prior year in Fairfield.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Percentage change over prior year in Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester prices were still going up, but at a single-digit pace. Sales were falling off moderately, and inventories were growing, but not as fast as in other areas in the region.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island prices were rising at single-digit rates, off their doubledigit pace earlier in the year. More people were putting homes on the market, but sales were stagnant, so inventories were growing. Long Island had a 10-month supply of homes on the market for the first time in 10 years.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes unexpectedly surged in February after falling for five months in a row, the National Association of Realtors reported yesterday, reflecting a lift related to unseasonably warm weather and signaling that the housing market is healthier than some experts had suggested.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales climbed 5.2 percent last month, to an annual pace of 6.91 million homes, after falling 8.9 percent in the previous five months. The nationwide median price -- the point at which half the homes sold for more and half for less -- climbed 10.6 percent from a year earlier, to $209,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes for sale, however, continued to climb, rising by 5.2 percent, to 3.03 million, which at the current pace of sales amounts to a 5.3-month supply of homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts, who had expected sales to fall to a pace of 6.5 million, cautioned that the increase could not yet be considered a turning point. Several other real estate gauges, including mortgage applications, interest rates and pending home sales, have indicated that sales are slowing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unusually warm January appears to have played some role in the sharp increase in sales. Warmer weather allows more people to venture out, and sellers often use the opportunity to hold open houses. The association counts homes as sold at the closing, which typically happens one to two months after contracts are signed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales jumped 19.2 percent in the Northeast, the biggest monthly increase ever recorded for the region, and 11.1 percent in the Midwest, the largest increase since 1992. Sales in the West climbed a more modest 5.1 percent, and they fell 2.5 percent in the South.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts say the surge in February could mean home sales will be softer later this spring. Since August, sales of existing homes have fallen 4.2 percent. Mortgage applications for home purchases have fallen by about 16 percent in the last 12 months, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices were higher than last year in all regions but were rising at a slower pace than they were last year, especially compared with the peak spring and summer months, when it was not unusual to see increases of 13 percent to 15 percent nationally.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents and analysts report that prices have dropped in some hot markets, and that appeared to be attracting some buyers who had been wary of local housing bubbles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Before, we had lots of people who were looking, but they said they weren't going to buy because they said prices were going to go down,'' said Chobee Hoy, an agent in Brookline, Mass., near Boston. ''And now we find ourselves in a very healthy market where people are not only looking at properties but making offers.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others say they expect sales to remain strong in the coming months. ''It was quiet, but the last few weeks have been brisk,'' said Bob Moulton, a mortgage broker on Long Island.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of condominiums and co-ops, which fell more than single-family home sales in the last few months, were up 8.8 percent in February, while sales of single-family homes were up 4.7 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department reported that claims for unemployment insurance fell by 11,000, to 302,000, for the week that ended March 18. The number of outstanding claims for the week that ended on March 11, however, rose by 38,000, to 2.5 million. That was down by 7.5 percent from the comparable week a year earlier.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS clusters of open-house balloons bob across the suburbs of the metropolitan area, from the New Englandy enclaves of Fairfield County to the salt-sprayed boroughs of the Jersey Shore, the question remains: whither the housing market?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone, it seems, has an answer, and those answers can be strangely contradictory and accurate at the same time. If inventory is your gauge, the market is slackening. If prices are your prism, it's still going strong.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in interviews with more than two dozen real estate agents, buyers, sellers and economists, the consensus is that the housing market in the region remains remarkably buoyant but is coming down to earth. Prices are still in the clouds, but inventory is expanding, sales volume declining and bidding wars, once commonplace, increasingly rare.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, the boom is over. Yet there is no bust in sight. ''It's turning,'' said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business organization. ''It's neither a buyer's nor a seller's market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers say they no longer feel pressured to make an offer the moment they step over the doorsill. (There are even isolated reports of sellers getting lowball offers.) Brokers, meanwhile, are lecturing sellers to be more realistic about prices, and sellers are working harder to spruce up their homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A few years ago, sellers were not making their beds and leaving dishes in the sink, and buyers were still coming and buying,'' said Cindy DeRose, a sales agent for Hudson Shores Realtors in Irvington, N.Y. ''It is still a healthy market. But it has cooled down enough that sellers just have to do a little more work, frankly.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the real estate market in the New York City suburbs has long had its ups and downs. But over time, houses there have proved to be extraordinary investments because people want to be close to the city while enjoying the relative safety and good public schools the suburbs offer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the pattern of contradiction in the current market seems fairly consistent from state to state, there are differences from one community to the next, with some towns appearing almost impervious to any downturn, at least for now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Anthony, a sales associate for Coldwell Banker in Mendham, N.J., called the current market ''town sensitive.'' He compared a Cape Cod in East Hanover, N.J., for $519,900 that has sat on the market for 80 days with a colonial in Millburn, N.J., that was listed for $775,000 and sold in two days.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anthony believes the market is still hot as long as three conditions are met: ''nice house, nice location and nice price.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the talk of a bubble, prices do not seem ready to collapse or even edge south, with the exception of houses whose price tags were plainly inflated. Brokers say the $1 million mark seems to be a dividing line: houses priced for less sell quickly, while houses listed for more are sitting longer and, in some cases, going for less than their list prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent statewide real estate data for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut show that housing prices continued to appreciate late last year, but at a less breathless clip than the year before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Rae D. Rosen, a senior economist and assistant vice president for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the growth rate in the price of an average house peaked at the same moment in all three states, the third quarter of 2004. New York State saw a 17 percent increase in sales prices for single-family houses, over the same quarter in 2003; Connecticut, 15 percent, and New Jersey, 18.5 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, in the last quarter of 2005, housing prices in New York rose 12.6 percent over the year before, 11.9 percent in Connecticut and 14.6 percent in New Jersey. Westchester County's fourth quarter witnessed a more modest increase of 6 percent. And some brokers believe that housing prices may be leveling off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like going from 60 miles per hour to 30 miles per hour,'' Ms. Rosen said of the rise in prices. ''We're just decelerating. It looks like the market is moving away from its peak.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armed with reports of an easing market and steeped in Internet research, some buyers are heading to open houses with raised hopes, expecting to find a house or a condominium they can not only afford but also actually want to inhabit. Some are equating a softening market with falling prices; they are often disappointed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to this market,'' said Claudia DeNatale, who recently toured a lackluster three-bedroom condominium in Huntington Station, N.Y., listed for $425,000. ''There's been so much talk about the market changing, but I don't see anything dramatic. When you talk about a drop, it should be significant.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What many buyers do report is greater choice. Indeed, inventory -- tight as a noose since 2000 -- is up across the region, sometimes markedly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, the number of unsold houses in January stood at 23,470, a 67 percent jump from the year before. Inventory in Connecticut also rose. In Fairfield County, the number of houses for sale at the end of last year was 35 percent higher than in late 2004. Inventories in some communities (Norwalk, Easton, New Canaan and Darien) were up more than 50 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey's inventory swelled, too, up 46 percent in January over the previous year. Westchester had the least growth in the number of houses on the market, 13 percent more at the end of 2005. If you add in co-ops and condominiums, the rise in inventory was 21 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief executive of Westchester County's real estate board, P. Gilbert Mercurio, said the total number of residential properties now on the market is still less than half that of the mid-1990's. ''The real estate boom ate into the inventory in Westchester County, and it is only now starting to rebuild,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the exact inventory increases, the effect is a more relaxed home-buying environment. Kelly Sabloff has sampled both markets. In 2001, she and her husband, Matthew, relocating from Montreal, bought an expanded Cape for $515,000 in Stamford. In February, after selling it for $680,000, they moved a short distance to a center hall colonial, for which they paid $747,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The big difference I noticed was the choice,'' Mrs. Sabloff said. ''Granted I was in a different price range four and a half years later. But there was a sheer volume of choice. You didn't have the pressure of, 'If you don't put an offer down, you're going to lose it.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Hanley, president-elect of the New Jersey Association of Realtors and manager of Weichert Realtors in Metuchen, N.J., agreed. ''Before we had one home for 10 buyers,'' he said. ''Now the one buyer can look at 10 homes.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For sellers, the new market dynamic can lead to frustration. Gary Harman watched in recent years as his neighbors sold Cape Cod-style homes for more than a half-million dollars. At the end of December, he put his house, in East Hanover, N.J., on the market for $539,000. None of the more than 25 people who came to see it made an offer. He has since dropped the price twice, to $519,900.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes his house stands out because of the abundant custom wood molding he installed himself. ''The discouraging part is that when the people go through the house, they don't even take that into consideration,'' he said. ''You could have holes in the house and it wouldn't matter.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sellers are newly self-conscious about the style of their house. Contemporaries, ranches and split-levels tend to sell more slowly than traditional houses, but that is even more true in a softening market, brokers say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lori and Greg Margolis are about to put their 1960's ranch in Harrison, N.Y., on the market for $2.2 million. It is a sizable property: 4,000 square feet on one and a half acres. They have transformed the house, which Mrs. Margolis termed a ''complete 1980's abomination,'' by renovating the bathrooms and painting the rooms stark colors. Still, she is approaching the listing with trepidation. ''The market's not vibrant now,'' she said. ''It's a nice house, but it's a certain look. The buyers in Westchester are not eclectic. It's very conservative. This house in L.A. would be the hippest, coolest house. People here like English country.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers, for their part, are feeling the pressures of rising interest rates and limited investment potential. The first would seem to propel buyers toward a purchase, so that they can lock in what is still a desirable rate. The second factor -- the possibility that the market may be at its peak -- may suggest caution.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that buyers are responding by looking for attributes that tend to prop up a home's value over time, like good schools and attractive commutes. More buyers are taking property taxes into account, too.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ruth Chizzini, vice president and director of relocation in Westchester for Sotheby's International Realty, said that escalating property taxes in the county were deterring some. ''When you come to New York, you can live in three states, and buyers are going with value,'' she said. ''We are very impacted by taxes. I just lost a couple of $3 million customers to Connecticut.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, some towns in the region enjoy such a buzz that market shifts are not acutely felt. There's Rye, N.Y., on Long Island Sound, with top-rated schools and many old and charming houses (quite a few of them mansions -- without the ''Mc'').  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, a house in the prestigious Milton Point section that was listed for $1.7 million went to a sealed bid, a more civilized take on the bidding war, when the seller's broker asks all potential buyers for their best offers and terms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Chizzini says tear-downs are still common in Rye, another sign of a superheated market: in March a builder closed on a $1.6 million house on less than a half-acre, with plans to knock it down and build anew. And two young couples were recently competing for one of Ms. Chizzini's Rye listings -- a four-bedroom split-level asking $875,000 that, in her words, ''needs everything, everything.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for every situation like that, there is one like the town house listed in late January by Carol Ann Decker, a sales associate in the Westport office of Country Living Associates. Mrs. Decker put the town house, in Fairfield, on the market for $535,000. ''We sold it instantly,'' she said. But the buyer got ''cold feet,'' she said, and failed to move forward with an inspection.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then three other buyers expressed interest. ''I thought, 'Oh, wow, this is going to be great,' '' Mrs. Decker recalled. ''But it's been a number of weeks and they're all just sitting and waiting.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photos: Matthew and Kelly Sabloff with Malkam, Oliver and Ava, in their new home in Stamford. This time, unlike 2001 when they bought a house, ''there was a sheer volume of choice,'' Mrs. Sabloff says. In West Harrison, N.Y., Dolores Tartaglia puts out an open house sign. Westchester had the least growth in the area in the number of houses on the market, 13 percent more at the end of 2005. (Photos by George M.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like going from 60 miles per hour to 30 miles per hour,'' Ms. Rosen said of the rise in prices. ''We're just decelerating. It looks like the market is moving away from its peak.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armed with reports of an easing market and steeped in Internet research, some buyers are heading to open houses with raised hopes, expecting to find a house or a condominium they can not only afford but also actually want to inhabit. Some are equating a softening market with falling prices; they are often disappointed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to this market,'' said Claudia DeNatale, who recently toured a lackluster three-bedroom condominium in Huntington Station, N.Y., listed for $425,000. ''There's been so much talk about the market changing, but I don't see anything dramatic. When you talk about a drop, it should be significant.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What many buyers do report is greater choice. Indeed, inventory -- tight as a noose since 2000 -- is up across the region, sometimes markedly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, the number of unsold houses in January stood at 23,470, a 67 percent jump from the year before. Inventory in Connecticut also rose. In Fairfield County, the number of houses for sale at the end of last year was 35 percent higher than in late 2004. Inventories in some communities (Norwalk, Easton, New Canaan and Darien) were up more than 50 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey's inventory swelled, too, up 46 percent in January over the previous year. Westchester had the least growth in the number of houses on the market, 13 percent more at the end of 2005. If you add in co-ops and condominiums, the rise in inventory was 21 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief executive of Westchester County's real estate board, P. Gilbert Mercurio, said the total number of residential properties now on the market was still less than half that of the mid-1990's. ''The real estate boom ate into the inventory in Westchester County, and it is only now starting to rebuild,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the exact inventory increases, the effect is a more relaxed home-buying environment. Kelly Sabloff has sampled both markets. In 2001, she and her husband, Matthew, relocating from Montreal, bought an expanded Cape for $515,000 in Stamford, Conn. In February, after selling it for $680,000, they moved a short distance to a center hall colonial, for which they paid $747,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The big difference I noticed was the choice,'' Mrs. Sabloff said. ''Granted I was in a different price range four and a half years later. But there was a sheer volume of choice. You didn't have the pressure of, 'If you don't put an offer down, you're going to lose it.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Hanley, president-elect of the New Jersey Association of Realtors and manager of Weichert Realtors in Metuchen, N.J., agreed. ''Before we had one home for 10 buyers,'' he said. ''Now the one buyer can look at 10 homes.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For sellers, the new market dynamic can lead to frustration. Gary Harman watched in recent years as his neighbors sold Cape Cod-style homes for more than a half-million dollars. At the end of December, he put his house, in East Hanover, N.J., on the market for $539,000. None of the more than 25 people who came to see it made an offer. He has since dropped the price twice, to $519,900. He believes his house stands out because of the abundant custom wood molding he installed himself. ''The discouraging part is that when the people go through the house, they don'teven take that into consideration,'' he said. ''You could have holes in the house and it wouldn't matter.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sellers are newly self-conscious about the style of their house. Contemporaries, ranches and split-levels tend to sell more slowly than traditional houses, but that is even more true in a softening market, brokers say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lori and Greg Margolis are about to put their 1960's ranch in Harrison on the market for $2.2 million. It is a sizable property: 4,000 square feet on one and a half acres. They have transformed the house, which Mrs. Margolis termed a ''complete 1980's abomination,'' by renovating the bathrooms and painting the rooms stark colors. Still, she is approaching the listing with trepidation. ''The market's not vibrant now,'' she said. ''It's a nice house, but it's a certain look. The buyers in Westchester are not eclectic. It's very conservative. This house in L.A. would be the hippest, coolest house. People here like English country.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers, for their part, are feeling the pressures of rising interest rates and limited investment potential. The first would seem to propel buyers toward a purchase, so that they can lock in what is still a desirable rate. The second factor -- the possibility that the market may be at its peak -- may suggest caution.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that buyers are responding by looking for attributes that tend to prop up a home's value over time, like good schools and attractive commuting. More buyers are taking property taxes into account, too.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ruth Chizzini, vice president and director of relocation in Westchester for Sotheby's International Realty, said that escalating property taxes in the county were deterring some. ''When you come to New York, you can live in three states, and buyers are going with value,'' she said. ''We are very impacted by taxes. I just lost a couple of $3 million customers to Connecticut.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, some towns in the region enjoy such a buzz that market shifts are not acutely felt. There is Rye on Long Island Sound, with top-rated schools and many old and charming houses (quite a few of them mansions -- without the ''Mc'').  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, a house in the prestigious Milton Point section that was listed for $1.7 million went to a sealed bid, a more civilized take on the bidding war, when the seller's broker asks all potential buyers for their best offers and terms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Chizzini says tear-downs are still common in Rye, another sign of a superheated market: in March a builder closed on a $1.6 million house on less than a half-acre, with plans to knock it down and build anew. And two young couples were recently competing for one of Ms. Chizzini's Rye listings -- a four-bedroom split-level asking $875,000 that, in her words, ''needs everything, everything.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for every situation like that, there is one like the town house listed in late January by Carol Ann Decker, a sales associate in the office of Country Living Associates in Westport, Conn. Mrs. Decker put the town house, in Fairfield, Conn., on the market for $535,000. ''We sold it instantly,'' she said. But the buyer got ''cold feet,'' she said, and failed to move forward with an inspection.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then three other buyers expressed interest. ''I thought, 'Oh, wow, this is going to be great,' '' Mrs. Decker recalled. ''But it's been a number of weeks and they're all just sitting and waiting.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photos: Matthew and Kelly Sabloff, above, with Malkam, Oliver and Ava, in their new home in Stamford, Conn.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's Up, What's Down: Prices, Sales and Inventories  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices stayed relatively strong through the end of 2005, but sales were falling in many places, and inventories were increasing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW JERSEY  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were still rising at a double-digit pace, but the increases were not as great in the hottest markets as they were earlier in the year. Sales were declining over all in the counties closest to New York City, and inventories were up 42 percent over a year earlier.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONNECTICUT  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were increasing at double-digit rates in Fairfield, but sales dropped sharply late in the year, so inventories grew. A sampling of 12 towns around Fairfield County showed inventories at the end of 2005 ranging from 11 percent to 59 percent higher than a year earlier.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester prices were still going up, but at a single-digit pace. Sales were falling off moderately, and inventories were growing, but not as fast as in other areas in the region.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island prices were rising at single-digit rates, off their doubledigit pace earlier in the year. More people were putting homes on the market, but sales were stagnant, so inventories were burgeoning. Long Island had a 10-month supply of homes on the market for the firsttime in 10 years.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bloomberg administration's decision to re-evaluate tax incentives to housing developers in New York City under popular 421-a program starts impassioned debate over amount of incentives that developers need to maintain growth of new housing units, especially in areas that are developing on their own, like downtown and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Harlem and Wall Street area; housing advocates want city to change rules to require that moderately price housing is built in projects receiving subsidies; experts want to avoid putting chill on market by removing subsidies and to identify areas where developers would build market rate housing even without tax breaks (M)   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along much of the East and West Coasts, home buyers and home sellers are engaged in a stare-down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many buyers, having heard that the real estate market is a bubble in danger of popping, are refusing to offer the asking price on a house, convinced that it will soon drop. But many sellers are not blinking either, thinking that offers will improve when the weather does and biding their time until then.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the housing market is now in a deeply confusing state, with average prices still rising even though homes are taking much longer to sell and the number on the market has soared. Sometime soon -- probably in the spring, the peak sales season -- one side or the other will have to capitulate, many economists and industry executives predict.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my opinion, the jury on housing is still out,'' said Antonio B. Mon, the chief executive of Technical Olympic USA, a home builder. ''The period from now until May will tell the tale.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many real estate agents argue that the current slowdown is merely a pause, pointing out that interest rates remain low and that Americans still seem convinced that houses are a great investment. Buyers, on the other hand, are hoping that the rising number of unsold homes is a signal that a slump is coming. It was an early sign of the last housing slump, in the early 1990's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the number of existing homes for sale jumped 36 percent between January 2005 and January of this year, the National Association of Realtors reported Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, 42 percent more co-ops and condominiums were available for sale at the end of last month than was the case a year ago, according to Miller Samuel, an appraisal company in New York. More Manhattan apartments were on the market in late February than at any point in at least five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, though, average selling prices have continued to rise, even in the markets that had already experienced the biggest leaps in prices and the increases continued even in the final months of last year. Prices rose 40 percent in the Phoenix area during 2005, according to the federal government. In Manhattan, the median price of an apartment was $760,000 at the end of last year, up from $605,000 at the end of 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest statistics on house prices appear to be dominated by sellers who, for one reason or another, quickly received good offers. That has kept average prices rising. Builders of new homes have also offered bonuses to buyers, like enclosed sunrooms or top-of-the-line appliances. So the builders have been able to continue selling homes without cutting the list prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many houses in the Northeast, Florida and California are, in fact, selling for less than they would have six months ago. In parts of the Northeast, the drop has been about 5 percent, estimated Robert I. Toll, chief executive of Toll Brothers, the biggest luxury home builder in the country. Other sellers have cut their price and still not found a buyer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Buxton, Me., a suburb of Portland, Geof and Cheri Toner put their three-bedroom Cape Cod-style house on the market for $379,900 late last year, shortly before moving to Raleigh, N.C., for Mr. Toner's job. They have received only one offer -- for $350,000, which they rejected -- and recently reduced the price to $374,900.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Toner said he assumed that more buyers would look at the property as the weather warmed up. In the spring, they would not have to wonder whether snow covered up flaws in the lawn or the roof. He expects that the eventual buyer will be a transplant from elsewhere in New England who is willing to pay significantly more than $350,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not panicking over it,'' said Mr. Toner, 48, the regional sales manager of a video equipment maker. ''It's just a matter of sitting it out and seeing what happens.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many real estate agents argue that people like the Toners are doing the right thing and that the market will not slump as it did a decade ago. The job market is now improving. The interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage remains just 5.79 percent, according to Bankrate.com. And the number of homes on the market remains far lower than in the early 1990's, relative to sales volumes, despite the recent increases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current slowdown is simply a transition, the agents say, from a scorching hot housing market to a normal, healthy one. ''All we are seeing is a pregnant pause,'' said Richard A. Smith, chief executive of Cendant's real estate division, which owns Coldwell Banker and Century 21, ''a disconnect between sellers and buyers.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many buyers say they have a sense that the long boom has finally come to an end.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the San Jose, Calif., area, where the average house price increased 21 percent last year, Sathish Pottavathini, a programmer at eBay, said he was taking his time with the search for a new home and trying to find a good deal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't want to rush into things especially in this kind of situation,'' Mr. Pottavathini, who is 32, said, ''where you hear about a slowing down everywhere.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife, Madhuri, spend $1,200 a month renting an 800-square-foot two-bedroom apartment, where they live with their 21/2-year-old daughter, Siri. They would like to find a three-bedroom town house with a two-car garage for less than $500,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although he does not expect prices to fall significantly, he does not think they will rise either and hopes he can find a bargain -- a goal that seemed all but impossible in Northern California in the last few years. Now, Mr. Pottavathini said, ''If I wait, I might get a better place.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who showed similar patience in the early 1990's were rewarded. From the summer of 1989 to the summer of 1990, the number of homes for sale rose about 10 percent, according to the Realtors association.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, many sellers refused to accept lower offers, thinking that they would get their asking price or close to it. But they eventually had to unload their houses, and in the Northeast and California that often meant reducing the price. In the Los Angeles area, the median sale price of existing houses fell 22 percent from 1992 to 1996, before taking inflation into account.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a similar slowdown were to happen again, Mr. Toner said he would consider changing his mind and his asking price. ''At some point, if this were to become protracted, I would consider lowering the price to attract a buyer,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pottavathini, meanwhile, is giving his San Jose search four months. After that, he plans to take a break and wait until his daughter is a bit older and his wife returns to work. With more money coming in, they might be able to pay more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they still have not succeeded, they would then consider leaving Northern California -- which he called ''the best place in the world'' -- and returning to their native India.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the condos become $600,000, it doesn't make any sense to live here,'' he said. ''Imagine owning a house and paying your whole life for that house. I would rather move back to India.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers of houses being sold has fallen, and the number on the market has risen. But average prices are still rising, albeit more slowly than they were a few months ago. This conflicting data has led buyers and sellers to different conclusions about the state of the real estate market.  </p>

In the intricate geography of celebrity known as the star maps, landmarks -- like people -- are evanescent. ''Pitt, Brad'' is indexed with ''Aniston, Jennifer'' (it's hard to keep up in Starland). ''Cruise, Tom'' and ''DiCaprio, Leo'' are on the map. Cher, who is as peripatetic as ''Monroe, Marilyn,'' is listed twice, while ''Grant, Cary,'' whose house was demolished for a gated community, is one of dozens of former icons now stricken from the map. But ''Dietrich, Marlene,'' ''<span class="companylink">Disney</span>, Walt'' and ''Sinatra, Frank'' are eternal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since the 1910's, when filmmakers like Cecil B. DeMille first set up shop in Hollywood, mapmakers, the Lewises and Clarks of the city's social terrain, began compiling that only-in-Los Angeles fixture, maps to the fabulous homes of the stars. Collectively, they form an unofficial, subterranean version of the Oscars, an unsung barometer of in and outness as potent as the noisy counterparts for sale at the supermarket checkout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Each home looks different,'' Linda Welton said over dinner at the Ivy (see ''Dine With the Stars'' on the map), her red lipstick and nails matching the scarlet route lines snaking through the maps her grandfather and mother pioneered. Those maps, updated regularly, are still for sale at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Baroda Drive, where Eva Gabor, who is off the map, walked her poodles in Holmby Hills. ''Take Dr. Phil's home,'' she said ( J-4 on the map). ''It has a round, Spanish-style look to it. Very dimensional. A beautiful tan peach color. It's a must-see home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1933, noticing the steady stream of tourists drifting westward to follow the stars from Hollywood to Beverly Hills, Ms. Welton's grandfather, Wesley G. Lake, obtained a copyright for his guide to Starland Estates and Mansions, the oldest continuously published star map and one of a half-dozen or so maps of varying degrees of accuracy and spelling correctness sold today. For 40 years her mother, Vivienne E. Welton, now 90, sold maps just down the road from Gary Cooper's place at 200 Baroda*. The asterisk denotes that it was the actor's final home, as opposed to a plus sign (denoting a former home) or a zero (for no view from the street).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My grandfather asked Mom to talk to the gardeners,'' Ms. Welton recalled, her stretch limousine body clad in black. ''She'd say: 'Oh, this is a beautiful garden. Who lives here?' Who would suspect a little girl?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Welton and her crew now sell about 10,000 maps a year from a folding chair parked curbside six days a week. They dispense the maps and give advice to the tourists on star safaris through the sliced-lime-green landscape of Beverly Hills. Along with companies like Starline Tours, whose vans travel in the wakes of Ferraris and Bentleys, the maps draw on the primordial human desire to see, as the Starline megaphone puts it: ''Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills and 40 or 50 of the most beautiful homes in the world!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They deliver a mostly concealed world of electronic gates and surveillance cameras hidden in hedges and a communion with celebrity concrete: the driveways of ''Zellweger, Renée'' or ''Rose, Axl'' (see stardriveways.com).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is an air of religious pilgrimage to seeing a star's home,'' said Martin Kaplan, the associate dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California. ''It is a bit like journeying to a religious shrine, or going to a remote town where a saint's liver is displayed in a bottle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evolution of the maps, which may be legally sold in Los Angeles County but not in Beverly Hills proper, mirror both the Hollywood publicity machine and real estate and tourism development. Early film stars like Lillian Gish lived in modest, somewhat grubby rooming houses, taking street cars to and from the studio. The first celebrity home, said Marc Wanamaker, a historian and a founder of the Westwood and Beverly Hills Historical Societies, belonged to the artist Paul De Longpré. His lushly landscaped pad at Cahuenga Avenue and Hollywood prompted real estate agents to take prospective clients by on tours. Although it is not known for certain who published the first map, by the mid-1920's everyone had one, from studios like Paramount, which published the names and addresses of its stars, to greeters at hotels, mothproofers and storage companies, which distributed them as a promotional gimmick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apotheosis of early map ardor was Pickfair, the sprawling mock-Tudor love nest of the newly divorced, freshly married Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks Sr. During World War I, the actress opened her home to serve refreshments to soldiers. ''She urged a few of her friends to do it, too, so they needed a map,'' Vivienne Welton once explained in an interview with Mercator's World, a map and cartography magazine. ''That was the beginning of it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For over 40 years hand-painted yellow placards have marched toward the corner of Sunset and Baroda proclaiming: ''Star Maps, 2 blocks,'' ''Star Maps, 1 block,'' ''Star Maps (arrow).'' Until about 15 years ago Vivienne Welton herself presided. In her pocket she kept a copy of Vivienne E. Welton v. the City of Los Angeles, the landmark 1976 State Supreme Court judgment that declared an ordinance prohibiting the sale of star maps unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the fantasy palaces listed in alphabetical order are sometimes a mirage. The real Pickfair, for instance, where Mary Pickford later took to the bottle among the roof leaks and frayed furniture, no longer exists. The Pickfair tourists clamor to see was built by Pia Zadora and her ex-husband Meshulam Riklis, who bulldozed the real one to build their own hulking, Venetian-style palazzo, recently sold to a Korean businessman for $18 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nine-room ranch in Encino that Clark Gable bought as a gift for Carole Lombard has been subdivided into an upscale tract development called the Clark Gable Estates, with streets named Tara Drive and Ashley Oaks. (The main house there is the home of the former junk bond king Michael Milken.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stars like Harrison Ford, Michael Jackson, Robert De Niro, Paul McCartney, Sean Penn and Madonna are not full-time Angelenos, while ''flippers'' like Cher and Diane Keaton, who enjoy renovating and selling houses, move often. (Sierra Towers, a Populuxe apartment building, has been added to the Starline tour because of Cher's recent purchase of a one-bedroom, 2,400-square-foot apartment for $4.5 million.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Topography is destiny, with choice properties at the end of dizzying winding mountain roads. Mindy Leach, a Starline tour guide, offers up this real estate truism: ''When your ears pop, add a million dollars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past decade Ms. Welton has run the business for her mother, making ''an O.K. living, better than some,'' she said. She supplements her income by selling real estate. (Her motto: ''It's time to live just like a star!'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her mother is committed to tradition, which can sometimes frustrate her daughter, who would like to add more new stars. ''I said, 'Mom, who's so-and-so?' '' Ms. Welton said. ''Can we please take them off? We've got some really hot ones.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like her competitors, Ms. Welton refuses to reveal the sources of the addresses, some of which are accurate and others defunct, according to real estate agents. ''I get leads from all over,'' she said before chatting up the valet at the Ivy, who disclosed that Chris Rock had dined there earlier. (''His loss,'' she said.) ''If I told you,'' she said of her sources, ''you and everybody else would make a map.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some extent, addresses are public, through real estate tax rolls and voting registration records, the latter technically available only for scholarly, journalistic, political or governmental purposes. Many stars buy property under a trust name, which is typically handled by a business manager, said Joe Babajian, chairman of Prudential Estates Properties in Beverly Hills. Beyond Internet databases, the phalanx of potential informants is boundless, including caterers, real estate agents, paparazzi, plumbers, decorators and, of course, Wesley G. Lake's gardeners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Locals know they are far more likely to see a star at the dry cleaners. Neil Simon was recently spotted in a fumy parking garage elevator in Beverly Hills. ''They don't go after writers much, because they don't understand them,'' Mr. Simon said of Ms. Welton and her ilk. (Note to Mr. Simon: You are at #136, A-5, on the map.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Welton, whose Web site is hotstarmaps.com, can reel off addresses from memory, as if celebrities were so many woodpeckers on the Audubon Christmas bird count. ''You take a right on Amalfi, a left on Sorrento, up four blocks, past Goldie Hawn and Sugar Ray Leonard,'' she said of one television actor's house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The maps reflect the shifting geography of stardom, as celebrities, seeking deliverance from overzealous fans, some with ill intentions, have fanned out to Pacific Palisades or the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. There they guard their privacy, or at least try to. For example, David Geffen's attention-drawing crusade to block public beach access next to his Malibu home was unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More profoundly, perhaps, the maps suggest the hauntingly quick nature of fame. Legendary stars -- Garbo, Monroe, Chaplin -- endure. Others, like Errol Flynn and John Barrymore, hang on for about a decade, then vanish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gone, too, are Don Ameche, Loretta Young, Bobby Sherman, Nancy Sinatra and members of the Partridge Family. ''Fred MacMurray is just forgotten, off the map,'' Mr. Wanamaker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the maps lead to the Osbourne house on Doheny Road, where gawkers can behold the fence over which Sharon classily threw a ham at the neighbors, dogs still yapping, or to Keanu Reeves, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Cameron Diaz and Halle Berry's groovy 'hood above Sunset Boulevard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If homes are owned for business purposes and never lived in, we take them off,'' Ms. Welton said. ''Alice Cooper moved to Arizona. He's off.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an age of cable TV, InStyle magazine and <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth, the maps to the stars' houses carry a certain amount of retro charm, much like a 1940 <span class="companylink">Smith Corona</span>. They hold out the possibility of spotting, if not Dr. Phil, then the girlfriend of Dr. Phil's son -- if not up close, then at least personal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Baroda Drive, Tom Gregory, who lives in Gary Cooper's old house, pulled up in his mint-condition 1979 Cadillac Seville. Mr. Gregory, who recently purchased two shirts at auction from the film ''Brokeback Mountain'' for a reported $101,000, considers the star maps at his corner part of the city's cultural memory. ''It's a quintessential part of Hollywood,'' he said. ''It's like living near the Hollywood sign.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes fell sharply last month, but prices increased -- a sign that home builders are luring buyers with incentives rather than lower prices and that demand, while weakening, remains healthy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported yesterday that January sales of new homes fell 5 percent, to an annual pace of 1.23 million, its lowest level in a year. Inventory of unsold new homes rose to a record level -- to 528,000 in January, up 1.2 percent from December and more than 20 percent from a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far, the drop in sales has not significantly depressed home prices. In January, the median price of a new home (meaning half sold for more and half sold for less) increased 6.7 percent from a year ago, to $238,100. Housing experts say that reflects the efforts by home builders to lure buyers by offering to pay closing costs and to upgrade appliances and other fixtures, incentives that may increase their costs but that does not show up as a drop in the final price paid by buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are switching from a red-hot sellers' market to a market that is better balanced between buyers and sellers,'' said David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on new home sales, which make up 15 percent of all transactions, are considered a leading but volatile indicator of the housing market because it uses a small data sample to estimate the number of purchase contracts signed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 3.8 percent in December and fell 7 percent in November, according to the data; they are down about 2 percent when averaged over the three months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, existing home sales, which make up 85 percent of all transactions, measure contract closings from a much larger sample. They have shown a more consistent pattern of slowing, falling 5.7 percent in December, 1.3 percent in November and 2.7 percent in October. The National Association of Realtors is expected to release January sales data today, and economists expect sales to be flat for the month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders say they are having to work a bit harder to sell properties, but buyers in many parts of the country remain interested, especially when the deal is sweetened with granite countertops and top-of-the-line kitchen appliances.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll Brothers, the nation's biggest luxury home builder, is using incentives like these in some markets on the coasts, as well as special loans that can reduce the introductory rate on an adjustable mortgage by 1 percentage point or more. But the company has not cut its list prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's being portrayed almost as a collapsing market, and it's not that way at all,'' said Robert I. Toll, the company's chairman and chief executive. ''But there's no doubt it's softer.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''If this is a collapsing market, I'll make a deal with the devil. I'll take it forever. This is not a bad market.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the true test for the housing market will come in the spring and summer, when home sales are typically at their highest level for the year. A significant slowdown during those months would hurt not only home builders but the economy as a whole, because it would reduce consumer spending on furniture and other household goods, and it could limit the ability of Americans to tap the value of their homes through refinancings and home equity loans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we have seen so far is a slowdown in transactions, rather than price levels,'' said Jeffrey L. Knight, chief investment officer at Putnam Investments, the mutual fund company, ''and that may well be the extent of what we see: a slowdown from a frenzied pace.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists remain reluctant to draw too many conclusions based on yesterday's report, noting longstanding concerns about the new-homes data, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 11.5 percentage points this month. Last year, the Commerce Department also changed which local housing permitting offices it surveys monthly, making comparisons to data from previous years less reliable for new homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell in most parts of the country, except the West, where they were up 11.3 percent. Sales declined the most in the Northeast, 14.9 percent, followed by the Midwest, 10.8 percent, and the South, 10.3 percent.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE were some eyepopping home sales on the East End in 2005, but overall sales for the year, according to recent data and many brokers, indicate a slowdown in the Hamptons real estate market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suffolk Research Service Inc., a firm that tracks East End real estate transactions, has released data compiled through the end of last year showing a big drop in the number of home sales in many East End towns.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of brokers out here are beginning to believe in a slowdown,'' said Peter Turino of Brown Harris Stevens of the Hamptons, who handles sales of some of the highest-priced properties in East Hampton.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we saw a slight deceleration in the market after Labor Day out here,'' Mr. Turino said. ''That could account for those numbers.'' Although there were fewer sales, the numbers show that median prices have continued to rise in Southampton, in East Hampton and, to a lesser extent, in Southold and Riverhead, on the North Fork.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Turino handled the $43 million sale of an 8.5-acre oceanfront property on Further Lane in Amagansett, bordered by more than 6 acres of land deeded to the Nature Conservancy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sale, in December, which some say raised the bar on Hamptons waterfront prices, illustrates the first half of the trend of the East End market over the last six months: high prices, but far fewer homes sold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Amagansett, the median home price increased by 27 percent, to $1.4 million, in 2005, but the number of homes sold dropped by 20 percent from 2004. Because of sales like the Further Lane home, the total dollars exchanged in home sales increased by 20 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The East End market caters mostly to second-home buyers, and its explosive price rises exceed those of communities farther west in Suffolk and even in Nassau County. The median price in Nassau rose nearly 8 percent, to $480,000, and in Suffolk, rose almost 7 percent, to $390,000, compared with January 2004, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. But all over the region, inventories are up; the number of homes on the market rose 65 percent over January 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Turino said Wall Street wealth over the last two years has driven ''asking prices to the sky'' for some properties in the Hamptons. ''Now the asking prices are at record-high levels as a result of all that activity,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the bull real estate market on the East End begins to ebb, Mr. Turino and others aren't sure how well the high-end homes will sell in coming months. ''Can you still make record sales?'' Mr. Turino said. ''That's what we're waiting to see.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the town of East Hampton, which encompasses Amagansett, the median price rose nearly 23 percent, to $849,000, but the number of homes sold dropped more than 11 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The same number of homes comes onto the market at any one time,'' said Htun Han, a partner at Hamptons Realty Group in East Hampton. ''But because they're not getting bought as quickly, there's a little bit of a traffic jam and more houses are currently on the market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers are also not as bold in setting prices on homes owned for just a few years, unless they have completely renovated them or made major repairs. ''It used to be people would think nothing about increasing the price by $50,000 or $100,000 for no reason, just because the market seemed to bear it,'' Mr. Han said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The larger inventory of homes, a majority of them in the $700,000 to about $3 million price range, Mr. Han said, gives buyers many more choices, ''which leads to a longer time to make a decision.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the west, in the village of Southampton, the median price rose a whopping 40.7 percent, to $1.33 million, while sales tumbled 20 percent in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, a home on 2.4 acres on Meadow Lane in Southampton sold for $24 million. In May and June, two other homes on the same street sold for $14.8 million and $14 million. All three contributed to the 21 percent increase in dollar sales in the village, to $409 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The larger town of Southampton showed more modest, but similar, changes. There, the median price rose nearly 17 percent, to $737,000, and sales dropped 12 percent. The median price increase was less striking than the rise of 26 percent in 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market now is more healthy than it was during the frenzied phase,'' said Paul Brennan, regional manager for the Hamptons for Prudential Douglas Elliman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money loses its meaning in a frenzied market, he said, when banks are lending hand over fist and people are buying homes, then flipping them at a profit two months later. ''People have slowed down,'' Mr. Brennan said, ''because probably they're scared themselves.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the North Fork, where acres of vineyards and golf courses have stemmed the pace of development, Hamptonites have stepped up their search for good real estate deals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waterfront property on the bay on the North Fork sells for about $3 million, according to Enzo Mirabito, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman who focuses on the North Fork. In the Hamptons to the south, the same house will cost $5 million, he said. ''So it's a difference of about 40 percent,'' Mr. Mirabito said. ''When it gets to that point, people start switching forks.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other lure, he pointed out, is that many houses on the north side of Peconic Bay ''get beautiful sunrises.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also more buyers looking for lower-priced waterfront homes on the North Fork's many creeks. Hot sellers include homes on the peninsula of land bordered by Jockey Creek and the larger Goose Creek, which open onto Southold Bay, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's around $1.2 million for a tear-down or fixer-upper,'' Mr. Mirabito said of the creek-front properties. ''You can put in a dock; you can have a boat. There's a big market for that on the North Fork.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's difficult to draw conclusions about smaller villages and hamlets from the Suffolk Research Service data, most real estate agents agree, because of the small volume of homes sold in those areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the town of Southold, which encompasses at least nine hamlets and villages, median prices rose 11.4 percent, to $490,000, while the number of sales rose less than 1 percent, to 533. In 2004, the number of houses sold there increased by 15 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riverhead, the other North Fork town, which begins at the junction of the two forks, experienced a moderate 5 percent increase in median prices. The number of sales, according to the Suffolk Research data, rose by nearly 11 percent, mostly because of a resurgence in Riverhead village and downtown revitalization.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back on the South Fork, Mr. Turino said he is in a wait-and-see pattern. Buyers and sellers cannot draw absolute conclusions from the data, he said, with spring and summer only a couple of months away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of Wall Street bonus money out there,'' Mr. Turino said, ''and traditionally that money gets invested out here, or at least, a good portion of it.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When developers in Arlington, Va., threw a party 18 months ago to showcase plans for Clarendon 1021, a condominium development that had not yet been built, 3,600 prospective buyers stood in line just for the chance to book reservations to bid on the apartments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, less than a year after the building opened, speculators in this and other buildings are putting dozens of units on the market at the same time, causing asking prices and profits to slip.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of 23 investors who sold since Clarendon 1021 opened last summer, the three most recent sellers actually lost money, after paying all fees, and average profits in the building have declined since August, said Frank Borges LLosa,) owner of FranklyRealty.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Great Condo Gold Rush is fading from memory and the Great Sell-Off has begun. ''Money Down! Motivated Seller, Want More? Just Ask!'' screamed an investor's online advertisement last week for a one-bedroom apartment in Clarendon 1021 that had never been lived in.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hate it when people say prices can never go down,'' said Mr. LLosa, a resident of the building. ''The speculators make the profits more volatile.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last few years, real estate speculators looking to make a quick gain also snapped up preconstruction condos in Chicago, Miami and San Diego. With prices rising by more than 20 percent a year, short-term buyers figured that by the time the condos were ready to occupy, they could sell them without ever moving in, clearing thousands of dollars in profits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as more speculators look to cash out in recently hot condo markets around the country, some economists say they could put even more downward pressure on prices in those buildings where for-sale listings are swelling. In Miami, at the Jade Residences at Brickell Bay, more than 20 percent of the building's 352 units are on the market. In San Diego, about a third of the 96 units in the Alicante, a condominium that opened last fall, are listed for sale and sellers are already starting to cut asking prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Donald Trump's luxury condos at 120 Riverside Boulevard in Manhattan, owners of more than one-fifth of the building's 250 units are currently marketing their apartments. With so much inventory, said Ilan Bracha, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman in New York, ''the buyers are coming in, checking the best views and then they negotiate. This is the reality.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While investors made up only 9.5 percent of residential mortgages nationally in the 10 months through October, according to First American Corporation's LoanPerformance, a San Francisco mortgage data firm, the numbers are much higher in places like San Diego, where investors represented 13.5 percent of residential mortgages, and Miami, where they were 16 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hans Nordby, research strategist at Property and Portfolio Research in Boston, said those numbers underreport the real level of speculation in those markets because many buyers disguise their intentions when they get their mortgages. As those speculators flood the market, he said, they will put pressure on other sellers to cut prices, too. ''A rising or sinking tide affects all boats,'' Mr. Nordby said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a sell-off in speculative condos is unlikely to start a widespread housing crash, because condos were more overbuilt than single-family homes during the recent boom, said Joseph Gyourko, professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. But weakness in the condo market, he said, ''is a consistent indicator that the great boom has really ended.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those buyers who had dreamed of quick riches, the change in the market has come as a sobering lesson. A little over a year ago, Shabana Qureshi, a 26-year-old engineer, put deposits down on two condos in Arlington. ''My friends were making hundreds of thousands of dollars off of properties,'' Ms. Qureshi said. ''I just thought I'll take this risk now and not think about it too much, and once the time comes I can either sell it or use it depending on my needs.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She moved into a one-bedroom condo at Clarendon 1021 with hardwood floors, granite kitchen countertops and a heated pool on the roof. But having taken a pay cut with a new job, she can no longer afford the mortgage and maintenance fees, which are almost $3,000 a month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, she put the condo, for which she paid $438,000, on the market for $470,000 and plans to move into the other condo she bought in Arlington. She is selling the Clarendon condo herself to save on the real estate commission. But even if she gets her asking price, she figures she will break even after closing costs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having scrimped to buy at what she said she believed was the peak of the market, Ms. Qureshi said she regretted her investments. If she had to do it all over again, she said she would have spent more money on travel and a new car. ''I would have been more carefree and invested once I had a family,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last few years, speculators were drawn to real estate because of double-digit appreciation. Nationally, median condo prices increased by nearly 13 percent, to $218,200, in 2005, according to the National Association of Realtors. But earlier this month, the group, which is based in Washington, forecast a slowdown in the rate of appreciation, saying that median home prices for all housing types -- single family, townhouses, condominiums and co-ops -- would rise by only 5 percent this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, the rate of appreciation in some of the hottest markets for speculators has slowed. In San Diego, the median home price (the exact middle of all prices) rose at an annual rate of just 2.5 percent in January, compared with 20 percent a year earlier, according to DataQuick Information Systems, a research firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, in a sign of a broader slowdown in the housing market, Toll Brothers, the luxury home builder, said orders for new homes fell by nearly 30 percent in the three months ended Jan. 31. On Monday, KB Homes also said that orders were down significantly and that more buyers were canceling contracts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, developers are still building condos in Miami, New York and Chicago, so speculators trying to sell will also have to compete with new units coming on the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown will affect all sellers, of course, but speculators may be more acutely affected if they were expecting speedy profits or are paying mortgage and maintenance costs on empty apartments. In some cases, even if they rent them out, the rents will not cover their costs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the first time that condo markets have been influenced by investors. In the late 1980's, developers converted thousands of condo units in the Northeast and many of them were bought by speculators, said Karl E. Case, an economist at Wellesley College. Many of those investors, he said, ended up losing money when they sold in the early 1990's. ''It was ugly,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More experienced investors take a philosophical view of what they see as inevitable setbacks. R. Dawn Stahl, a lawyer in San Diego who bought two apartments in the Alicante, is now trying to sell both of them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a city where there are about 6,200 condos for sale, up from about 3,100 this time last year, according to the San Diego Association of Realtors, it has been difficult to lure buyers. Ms. Stahl has yet to receive any offers, so she has already lowered her asking price on one of the listings from $650,000 to $599,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She paid $499,000 for that two-bedroom apartment and said she believed she would make a small profit after paying commissions and capital gains taxes. But if she cannot sell within a few months, she will rent the apartments out instead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I knew thatwas a risk that I took,'' Ms. Stahl said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a reason that a speculative sell-off is not likely to lead to a bursting bubble is that unlike stocks, where investors can panic and sell large volumes in a matter of hours, owners of real estate will only slash prices so far. ''People resist and don't sell,'' said Mr. Case. ''It tends to stabilize prices.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year and a half ago, Erez Abkzer, who owns a window treatment business in New York, signed a contract for a one-bedroom condo facing the river in 120 Riverside for $850,000. ''The market was booming and I decided to jump on that wagon,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He closed on the apartment last month and immediately listed it for $1.1 million. He said he would rent the apartment rather than lower his price. ''Otherwise it would all be in vain,'' Mr. Abkzer said. ''I won't make money on it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers say that speculators have unrealistic profit expectations. ''I think a lot of sellers are saying I should make X percent,'' said Eve Thompson, an agent with Long &amp; Foster in Fairfax, Va. ''But your chances of being able to do that are as good as going to Oracle and telling them you want more for your stock.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, where there appears to be a large overhang of investor properties, sellers are still making profits, said Ron Shuffield, president of Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors. But with the inventory of available condos having jumped from about 5,400 listings at the end of December 2004 to about 12,750 now, he said, asking prices have come down in the last three or four months. Mr. Shuffield said he was confident that there would eventually be takers for most of those condos because of the influx of buyers from Latin America and Europe as well as baby boomers from the Northeast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some real estate watchers say there is evidence that demand is starting to slacken in Miami. According to Michael Y. Cannon, managing director of Integra Realty Resources-South Florida, a market analyst, the volume of sales of existing condos declined by 9.6 percent in South Florida between 2004 and 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the bumper crop of properties is a boon to buyers. In San Diego, Tom Hinks, a 21-year-old who is looking to buy a condo downtown, has realized he can take his time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His approach might scare some sellers. Since Mr. Hinks started looking four months ago, he has viewed 30 condos. ''I've actually liked quite a few of them,'' he said. ''But every day it seems like the prices are starting to trim down so I don't want to pay too much.''  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Housing Starts In January Hit 33-Year High  </span>
</div><div class="author">By VIKAS BAJAJ  </div><div>693 words</div><div>17 February 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction jumped 14.5 percent to a 33-year high last month, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, a sign that builders may have taken advantage of unseasonably warm weather in January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report surprised many analysts because home sales have slowed and the number of unsold homes has risen in many markets around the country in the last several months. Many home builders have also been saying that they are offering bigger incentives to lure buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, builders began constructing homes -- known as housing starts -- at an annual pace of 2.28 million, the fastest level since 1973, after a drop of 6.9 percent in December. Permits for new construction increased 6.8 percent, to 2.22 million, after falling 4.1 percent in December. Compared with January 2005, housing starts were up 4 percent, the government reported.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warmer weather tends to spur construction activity, and the average temperature in the United States in January, at 39 degrees, was the highest ever recorded by the government, an increase of 8.5 degrees over the historical average for the month. The unusual weather has also been cited for stronger retail sales and weaker industrial production, the latter because utilities produced less electricity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a time-tested pattern,'' said David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, noting that builders may have started work on homes that they sold ahead of construction at the end of last year. ''February has essentially returned to normal conditions, suggesting to me that we will see a substantial decline in housing starts.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effect of the weather could further be magnified because most economic data, including housing starts, is adjusted to account for seasonal weather and other patterns. Because January is usually one of the coldest months of the year, those adjustments would have bolstered the data that the Commerce Department reports for the month even if construction were flat. Before adjusting for seasonal factors, housing starts were up 11.3 percent from December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Builders were able to build and so they were out there doing it, and the seasonal adjustment process pumped it up,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist at MFR, a research firm in New York.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing start data is also subject to a significant margin of error, plus or minus 9.9 percentage points in January, because it is based on a relatively small sampling of data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just last week, two large home builders warned about slowing sales: Toll Brothers, the nation's largest luxury home builder, said orders fell 21 percent in the three months ended Jan. 31 compared with the same period a year ago, and KB Home said more buyers were canceling orders and fewer were signing contracts in the first two months of the year compared with 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as they acknowledge the slowdown, many housing industry officials are generally optimistic about the year to come, given that mortgage interest rates remain low and that the economy has been adding jobs at a stronger clip in recent months. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.15 percent in January, up from 5.71 percent a year earlier, according to Freddie Mac, but that is still low by historical standards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody would agree that 2006 won't be 2005,'' said William Emerson, chief executive of Quicken Loans, a mortgage lender based in Livonia, Mich. ''But it will be strong.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building activity was strongest in the Northeast, where starts jumped 29.2 percent; followed by the Midwest, up 23.7 percent; the West, 16.9 percent; and the South, 8.7 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment insurance climbed by 19,000 last week, to 297,000 for the week ending Feb. 11. At 2.5 million, the total number of jobless claims at the end of Feb. 4 was down 7 percent from a year earlier.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRADERS will have a lot of information served to them this week, but in the opinion of Mike Williams, a strategist at Tocqueville Asset Management, they will find little of it palatable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports on consumer activity (retail sales and consumer confidence), manufacturing (industrial production and capacity utilization) and the housing market (housing starts and building permits) will follow one another in quick succession, beginning on Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Williams foresees readings ranging from neutral to favorable, showing a resumption of healthy economic growth after a subdued fourth quarter. But he is concerned that Wall Street will make the worst of a good situation and sell on the news.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the rosiest reports could be the snapshot of January retail sales, due Tuesday. A Bloomberg News poll of economists forecasts an increase of 0.9 percent. Mr. Williams predicts a higher number, seeing ''a bit of a rebound'' from smaller gains in previous months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When January wholesale prices are announced Friday, ''there may be a bit of elevation,'' he said, but only a bit. ''We've never been believers that we have an inflation problem,'' he added. As for the real estate market, he said, ''everybody already expects a slowdown in housing, and they'll get what they expect.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, he anticipates a benign set of numbers, but he warns that stocks may decline when some of them are announced because investors are unsure of what they should worry about.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a fourth-quarter ''speed bump,'' in which economic output increased at a 1.1 percent annual rate, investors have worried that growth is weakening, he said. He does not share that concern, describing the economy as one of ''sustainable growth, with many sectors operating at full strength.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet as evidence arrives confirming his view, he said, it may stir fear that the Federal Reserve, in Ben S. Bernanke's first weeks as chairman, is not nearly as inclined to stop raising interest rates as many people think. ''The market's in a no-win situation,'' Mr. Williams said. ''I don't see any real headway in the overall picture. Until Bernanke says it's finished, people are going to be afraid of strong economic numbers.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DATA WATCH -- A mixed picture of January manufacturing is expected to emerge on Wednesday. The Bloomberg poll forecasts a 0.2 percent increase in industrial production after a 0.6 percent gain in December. Capacity utilization is expected to edge up to 80.8 percent, from 80.7 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No more clarity is expected from housing reports the next day. Housing starts are estimated to have run at an annual rate of 2.03 million units in January, up from 1.93 million in December. Building permits are thought to have dipped to an annual rate of 2.070 million, from 2.075 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The University of Michigan's initial reading of February consumer confidence is due Friday. The Bloomberg poll predicts a drop to 91, from 91.2 in January.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell in December for the third consecutive month, a trade group reported yesterday, even as the housing market registered a fifth consecutive year of increased sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data appear to suggest that the era of rapidly increasing sales may be coming to a close. Sales in December fell 5.7 percent, to an annual pace of 6.6 million homes, after a 1.3 percent dip in November and a 2.7 percent drop in October. It was the lowest level of sales since March 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell or stayed flat in all four regions of the country, while the total inventory of homes for sale dipped slightly, the National Association of Realtors reported. Median prices -- half the homes sold for less, half for more -- were up 10.5 percent, to $211,000, from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the year, home sales grew 4.2 percent, to 7.07 million, setting another record. The nation's long housing boom is almost a decade old, with the exception of 2000, when sales fell by 0.4 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing boom in the United States is over,'' said Lynn Reaser, the chief economist for Bank of America's investment strategies group. ''It at this point appears to be on the soft-landing plane, with sales slowing, some growth of inventory and sellers not receiving their full asking price.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy has become increasingly dependent on the growth generated by home sales, mortgage refinancings and related spending. A housing slowdown is figuring prominently into many analysts' forecasts for slower economic growth in 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But forecasters have pronounced an end to the boom before and were proved wrong. Mortgage interest rates, though higher than a year ago, remain near historical lows, making home ownership more affordable for many. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.1 percent last week, up from 5.71 percent in January 2005, according to Freddie Mac.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the sharpness of the current slowdown, and whether it will become more severe, will not become clear until the peak spring and summer home-buying season.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in markets on the coasts that have experienced sharp increases will be an important barometer for the housing market this year, along with mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Prices, though still higher than a year ago, did not rise as fast in December as they did earlier in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials with the Realtors' group said a fundamentally strong economy and housing demand would help keep home sales generally steady, but even they acknowledged that the market had changed. ''Clearly the air is coming out of the balloon,'' David A. Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors association, said, according to Bloomberg News. ''We're transferring from a sellers' market to a buyers' market.'' The association expects sales to drop 4.4 percent in 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December sales dropped the most in the West, 11.4 percent, followed by the South at 7.2 percent and the Midwest at 2.6 percent. Sales activity in the Northeast was unchanged from November.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the number of homes available for sale dropped to 2.8 million at the end of December, from 2.9 million, but because of the slower pace of sales, that represented 5.1-month supply of homes, up from a five-month supply in November.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Fred Goldhirsch, a builder, put his 1980's contemporary on Linden Lane in Bedford Corners on the market a year ago for $1.19 million, the house just sat there. Even with a babbling brook and pond on four wooded acres, the house had no takers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frustrated, Mr. Goldhirsch, who by then was living in New York City, took the 3,700-square-foot four-bedroom home off the market and plotted a new sales strategy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goldhirsch put his house up for sale at a time that the market was seen as favoring sellers, but he may have been one of the first to detect a shift in conditions. According to real estate agents around the county, the longstanding seller's market has begun to tilt in the other direction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of 2005, inventory for all types of residences was up about 20 percent from a year earlier, to 4,700 units, according to P. Gilbert Mercurio, the executive director of the Westchester-Putnam County Board of Realtors in White Plains.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sellers now have to pay attention to what similar houses are going for and not expect buckets of offers,'' Mr. Mercurio said,  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the steep upward climb of the median price for a single-family home in Westchester has slowed, sellers like Mr. Goldhirsch have had to either reduce their prices or offer buyers more for their money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At last count -- the third quarter of 2005 -- the median sales price of a single-family home in Westchester was $711,700, up 4 percent from the corresponding period a year before. The breakneck speed of the market increases of previous years had begun to ease, Mr. Mercurio said in his third quarter report. The report for the final quarter of 2005 is not yet available.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of price gains from a year earlier, the market has been cooling for a while. The price in the second quarter was 6.1 percent higher than a year earlier; the comparable figure in the first quarter was 7.9 percent and in the final quarter of 2004, 14.4 percent. Real estate agents say that the balance of power at the negotiating table between buyers and sellers has become more even.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Before, everyone was in a frenzy,'' Patricia Warnken, a broker with Coldwell Banker Doernberg in Scarsdale observed. ''Now, it's as it should be.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the number of homes on the market increases, so does competition among sellers, which means that houses that are dated and in need of refurbishing often need makeovers now to find a suitor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, as soon as the ''For Sale'' sign on Mr. Goldhirsch's house came down, a decorator went to work. The all blue-gray exterior was repainted in soft white, with beige trim; the front door was painted red; landscapers pulled out debris and dead bushes and replaced them; and some trees came down to reveal the expanse of the large property.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, a broken slate walkway leading up to the front door was replaced; the deck behind the house was expanded and repainted; and the dingy outdoor lighting fixtures were replaced with crisply styled bronze and glass ones.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the curb-appeal index for the outside of the house was notched up, decorators and real estate agents took a hard look at the inside. There, dark orange colors were replaced with off-whites -- with ''a light, bright wash designed to please a wide audience,'' explained Jeanne-Aelia Desparmet-Hart, the owner of JADH Design in Scarsdale. ''No one should come in and say, 'I hate that color.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the kitchen, Formica countertops came off, and granite ones were installed. Old floor tiles were replaced with wood floors, wallpaper came down, bathrooms were overhauled, and French doors were installed to open up vistas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything was made lighter and warmer and peppier,'' Ms. Desparmet-Hart said. ''Kitchens and bathrooms are especially important, because often they're what sell a home.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After about $250,000 in renovations, Mr. Goldhirsch's house is now back on the market, listed at $1.299 million. It is one of 31 single-family homes for sale at $1 million to $1.5 million in the Bedford Central School District, according to Multiple Listing Service statistics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asking price reflects what comparable properties in Bedford are now selling for, said Jennifer Vaccaro of Julia B. Fee Real Estate, one of the listing agents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goldhirsch said that from his experience as a builder in Staten Island, he has learned that ''buyers often know more than sellers what the market is.'' He added, ''They do all the legwork; they look at everything.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Julia B. Fee, George M. Stone, a managing principal, observed that in the current market, buyers prefer either new construction -- of which there is relatively little in Westchester -- or 20th-century homes that are refurbished ''to match up with 21st-century tastes, with new kitchens and baths and contemporary paint colors.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In other words, for a house to sell in this market, ideally it should be in move-in condition,'' said Mr. Stone, who has recently begun renovating his 1935 Dutch colonial in Scarsdale, with an eye toward putting it on the market. ''Most buyers don't want to be bothered with having to do the work themselves.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when a house is already in good condition, according to Ms. Warnken at Coldwell Banker, the chance for it to sell at the asking price increases if it undergoes some cosmetic changes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, she said, a colonial house on the market on Taunton Road in Scarsdale for $2.895 million has been repainted inside and out with light and bright contemporary colors, and the gutters have been replaced with copper ones. Inside, fresh flowers have been placed in vases throughout, and just before a buyer is brought around, a pot of cinnamon begins simmering on the stove or cookie dough goes into the oven.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wouldn't have had to do all this a year ago,'' Ms. Warnken said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notwithstanding the extra effort required to sell a house now, many real estate agents said they were pleased to see the market shifting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a return to a classic market, and I welcome it,'' said Elizabeth Lindsey, a broker-manager for Houlihan Lawrence.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a much better situation now, with offers going back and forth in the bidding process, instead of all the multiple offers before, and people getting hurt and soured.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New housing starts fell sharply in December and building permits fell to their lowest level since May, the government reported yesterday, reflecting a slowing in the housing market from a peak last summer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said the number of homes that builders began constructing last month fell 8.9 percent, to an annual pace of 1.93 million. The number of permits issued dropped 4.4 percent, to a pace of 2.07 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected housing starts at an annual pace of 2.04 million and a permit pace of 2.1 million, according to a survey by Bloomberg News. Cooler weather than normal and heavy rains in the West last month may have been a factor in the depressed construction activity, analysts said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of that 8.9 percent, maybe a third of it was weather-related,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, a forecasting and data gathering firm in Lexington, Mass. ''The rest of it is an underlying trend of weakness in the housing market. You are seeing pervasive signs of weakness.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2005, housing starts rose by 5.6 percent, to 2.06 million, a level exceeded only in 1972. Of those starts, 1.71 million were single-family homes, a record. Permits issued rose 3.4 percent, to 2.14 million homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing sales dipped and inventories rose through the last several months of 2005 after a booming spring and summer. Several large home builders have said they are offering promotions to sell properties that were previously attracting multiple offers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, housing starts dropped the most in the Midwest, falling by 23.6 percent, and in the West, where they dropped 21.7 percent. Construction activity in the South rose 5.2 percent, possibly reflecting the increase in construction in areas damaged by last fall's hurricanes along the Gulf Coast. In the Northeast, starts fell 14 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices, however, have not fallen from comparable levels a year earlier and few economists expect them to do so, in large part because mortgage rates still remain near historic lows.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts caution that housing data becomes less reliable at the end and beginning of the year because sales trail off significantly in the winter. The state of the market will become far clearer in the spring and summer months when most home sales occur.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home construction data are particularly unreliable; the housing start statistic carries a margin of error of plus or minus 8.6 percentage points. The new permits figure has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points. The National Association of Home Builders estimates that housing starts will drop about 6 percent, to 1.94 million, in 2006. ''Builders are both reporting and expecting to see slowing demand,'' Michael S. Carliner, an economist at the association, said. ''It's no longer quite so much of a sellers' market.'' But he added that ''2005 is a pretty high standard of comparison.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department reported yesterday that new claims for unemployment insurance fell by 36,000 last week, to 271,000, their lowest level in nearly six years. The number of continuing claims fell by 158,000, to 2.53 million; that is down about 6.3 percent from the comparable period a year earlier.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHITE PLAINS -- SOON after the luxury condominiums at Trump Tower went on the market early last year in this city's rapidly growing downtown, Mary Ellen Gramolini snapped up a two-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath unit for $570,000. ''I got in on the ground floor,'' said Mrs. Gramolini, who then sat back and watched as the prices of units in Trump Tower soared.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Gramolini's plan was to rent out her unit for several years and then, once her three children were grown and on their own, move in with her husband, Tom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she became worried that the market was becoming saturated and that she might have trouble renting her apartment, and she put her unit up for sale in the fall, asking $699,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was not the only one who decided to speculate on the 212 condos in the newly built 35-story Trump Tower at City Center, where some units offer views of the New York City skyline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Durante, a real estate investor and law student at Pace University, purchased a two-bedroom penthouse condo with two and a half baths and a 500-square-foot terrace at the new Trump building for just over $1 million. Last fall, when the units in the residential tower were almost sold out, Mr. Durante put his condo on the market for $1.9 million. When it did not sell, he lowered the price to $1.79 million. It still has not sold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Mrs. Gramolini and Mr. Durante tried to do what many speculators have done during the hot condo market of the past 18 months -- buy at a low price and then flip their units six months or a year later. But as Mrs. Gramolini and Mr. Durante and others learned this fall, the upward momentum of the real estate market seems to have abated somewhat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Gramolini's condominium is in contract. She would not reveal the sale price, although she indicated it was below her asking price. ''Because I got in at the ground floor, I'm not taking a loss,'' she said. ''It just didn't work out as well as I had hoped.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Durante put two condos on the market: a penthouse he occupied in another section of downtown White Plains and his Trump condo. The occupied unit sold quickly. He said he would move into his unsold Trump condo.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not just in White Plains, but all over Westchester, the condo market has softened,'' Mr. Durante said. ''It's especially true in White Plains,'' because another high-end residential project is nearing completion, ''and people have a lot to chose from,'' he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of 125 apartments on which buyers have already closed at Trump Tower at City Center, about one-third returned to the market shortly after their closings. Some people describe the surfeit of condos on the market in White Plains as a glut.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors in White Plains, called that an overstatement, even though there are currently 56 percent more condominiums on the market countywide than there were a year earlier -- 600 at last count, compared with 397 last December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yes, inventory has increased because the market is slowing down in Westchester and elsewhere,'' he explained. ''But we're still a very long way from using words like 'overhang' or 'glut' to describe the situation.'' Looking back, he said, there were 860 condos for sale at the end of 1996, and 1,100 condos in the early 1990's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, 2004 was a record year in terms of the number of condominiums sold, 1,438, and 2005 came close. As of Dec. 29, there had been 1,400 condo sales, Mr. Mercurio said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, though, the real estate market -- for stand-alone and multifamily homes and co-ops as well as condos -- is slowing down, and the net result is that some speculators, especially condo speculators like Mrs. Gramolini and Mr. Durante, have been disappointed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Rand, a managing partner for Prudential Rand Realty, reported last week that his company has more than a dozen never-occupied units in Trump Tower in White Plains listed for sale. They range from a three-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath unit listed at $1.795 million, to a one-bedroom two-bath unit going for $789,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This high number of units on the market partly reflects the property's exceptional early performance, Mr. Rand explained. Sales were so rapid that the building almost sold out within a few months of the initial offering. In response to the unexpectedly robust demand, the tower's developers, Louis Cappelli and Donald J. Trump, raised prices several times in the ensuing months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rand said the rush to buy Trump condos was as feverish as a sale in a department store. When early buyers saw how much more later buyers were paying, a number of owners ''turned around all at the same time and put the condos back on the market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has rapidly changed the dynamics at the Trump Tower. ''Whenever you have a lot of people selling the same product at the same time, you have a buyer's, not a seller's, market,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cappelli estimated that about 25 percent of the condos in the project -- an unusually high percentage -- were bought by speculators who never intended to live in the units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Cappelli has 200 more units in Renaissance Plaza, two 40-story-high towers in downtown White Plains, coming on the market in February at prices somewhat higher than those at Trump Tower. Mr. Cappelli conceded that the speculators selling condos at Trump Tower were ''undercutting the new product a little.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renaissance Plaza, a $400 million complex, includes hotel and office elements. In all, it has approximately 890,000 square feet and is diagonally opposite Trump Tower and City Center, a shopping and residential complex.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate observers like Mr. Mercurio at the Board of Realtors described the current real estate market as ''in the process of sorting itself out.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henry Uman, a retired real estate lawyer in Larchmont who has witnessed market ups and downs over 40 years, said that speculators interested in flipping properties should always be prepared to weather the vicissitudes of the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When the need arises,'' he said, ''you have to have the wherewithal to stay with things over time.''  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Apartment Sales Decline, But Manhattan Prices Hold   </span>
</div><div class="author">By JOSH BARBANEL   </div><div>953 words</div><div>4 January 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an uncertain real estate market, the number of sales of Manhattan co-ops and condominiums fell sharply in the last quarter, though prices were mostly flat, according to market data released yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sale prices remained above the levels of a year ago although they were below the record high prices reported in the spring.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales usually slow during the holiday season, but this decline was precipitous, 21 percent below the number reported in the previous quarter and 27 percent below the number of sales in the last quarter a year earlier, according to a market report released yesterday by Prudential Douglas Elliman.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline was widely attributed to uncertainty by buyers who were spooked by reports of a real estate bubble about to burst, and worries over the economic damage from higher gasoline prices, hurricane damage and rising mortgage rates. The Elliman study reported 1,574 sales in the last three months, compared with 1,997 the previous quarter and 2,181 in the spring when prices were highest.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was a negative swirl in the market; every pronouncement using the bubble term made buyers pause,'' said Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm, who prepared the Elliman report. ''We are not seeing prices fall; we are just seeing fewer sales.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the uncertainty was the release of three contradictory market reports yesterday purporting to measure the same thing -- current prices of Manhattan co-ops and condos. Prices were reported to be up slightly, down slightly, or down more sharply, from the previous quarter, depending on who was counting.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Elliman report found that despite the slowing sales, the average price of a Manhattan apartment rose 3.3 percent, to $1,187,000, from the previous quarter, but nearly 10 percent below the peak reported in the second quarter. Even so, the average remained 23 percent above the average in the last quarter of 2004.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it reported that the average sale price per square foot -- which takes into account the changes in mix of large and small apartments -- rose above $1,000 for the first time this quarter, to $1,002 a square foot.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second report by two other brokerage firms, Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead, found that average prices declined from the previous quarter by 4.3 percent, to $1,090,000. A third report by the Corcoran Group, found that average prices had declined 7 percent, to $1,129,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The differences reflect the difficulties in collecting data in Manhattan, where co-op sales prices are not publicly reported, and condominium sale deeds are often filed a month or more after a sale is completed. But they may also reflect changes in the market that occurred late in the quarter that were picked up by some surveys but not by others.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers said, for instance, that they had seen a flurry of contracts in the last few weeks, especially in the more expensive apartments, as buyers contemplating softening prices and end-of-year bonuses decided to overcome their fears and buy. But most of them would not have found their way into the reports.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was significant pickup in the last six weeks of the market; the buyers came flocking back,'' said Pamela Liebman, chief executive and president of the Corcoran Group. ''Part of it was the anticipation of the Wall Street bonuses, part of it was the feeling that there was some opportunity to buy and negotiate.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market watchers also point to other optimistic signs: a handful of sales of more than $10 million that have gone into contract but not yet closed, and that are not reflected in the current data. And they note that the current market numbers do not include dozens of sales in new buildings that went to contract this fall but will not be reflected in sales statistics for a year or more, until buildings are completed and the sales close.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory Heym, chief economist for Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead, attributed the decline in the average sale price in his study to the declining share of sales of large apartments in the last six months, and the increasing share of lower-priced studios and one-bedrooms.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only thing holding prices back is the fact that mix has changed,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his study, for instance, sales of studio and one-bedroom apartments accounted for 61 percent of all sales, up from 55 percent in the fourth quarter a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Corcoran study, which recorded the largest decline in overall average sales, prices of one- and two-bedroom apartments actually rose, while those of studios and large apartments of three bedrooms or more fell.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of unsold co-ops and condos on the market also rose again in the last quarter, often a sign of a weakening market. Yet the increase, 3.5 percent to 5,964 listings, was only modest, compared with the 16 percent increase from the second to third quarter, according to Mr. Miller. The average number of days an apartment was on the market rose by four days, from 133 to 137.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory listings at the end of this quarter, 5,964, were far above the level reported a year earlier, when only 3,922 apartments were listed. Mr. Miller said inventory at the end of 2004 was the lowest in more than four years and marked the start of a large run-up in prices, and worries about a market bubble.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said the current inventory levels were below those found several years ago, and closer to balance between buyers and sellers.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In spite of record home prices, housing in most of America remains surprisingly affordable, thanks to low interest rates. That fact may seem to say that there's no housing bubble. But it doesn't. To see why, we need to brush up on our economic geography and economic history.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's start with the good news. A report in last week's Times summarized the results of a study by Moody's Economy.com, a research company, comparing the cost of home ownership with family incomes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study found that for the nation as a whole, the cost of owning the median home is still only 23.7 percent of median family income, which is higher than a few years ago but well below the peak of more than 30 percent reached in the early 1980's.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now for the economic geography. Last summer I suggested that when discussing housing, we should think of America as two countries, Flatland and the Zoned Zone.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Flatland, there's plenty of room to build houses, so house prices mainly reflect the cost of construction. As a result, Flatland is pretty much immune to housing bubbles. And in Flatland, houses have, if anything, become easier to afford since 2000 because of falling interest rates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Zoned Zone, by contrast, buildable lots are scarce, and house prices mainly reflect the price of these lots rather than the cost of construction. As a result, house prices in the Zoned Zone are much less tied down by economic fundamentals than prices in Flatland.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By my rough estimate, slightly under 30 percent of Americans live in the Zoned Zone, which comprises most of the Northeast Corridor, coastal Florida, much of the West Coast and a few other locations. So Economy.com's results on affordability aren't surprising: most families live in Flatland, and haven't seen a big rise in the cost of home ownership.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because Zoned Zone homes are much more expensive than Flatland homes, the Zone looms much larger in the housing story than its share of the population might suggest. By my estimate, more than half of the total market value of homes in the United States lies in the Zoned Zone.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And because home prices have risen much more rapidly in the Zone than in the rest of the country, the Zoned Zone accounts for the great bulk of the surge in housing market value over the last five years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if we want to ask whether housing values make sense, data on the median house nationwide are irrelevant. We need to focus on houses in the Zoned Zone. And there the numbers are anything but reassuring.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Zoned Zone, the story that rising home prices have been offset by falling interest rates is all wrong: prices have risen so much that housing has become much less affordable. According to Economy.com, the cost of owning a home in the New York metropolitan area went from 25 percent of median income in 2000 to 38 percent today. In Miami, the numbers were 21 percent and 42 percent, respectively; in Los Angeles, 31 percent and 55 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the current cost of owning a home in the Zoned Zone isn't entirely unprecedented. Roughly similar percentages of median family income were needed to afford houses in the early 1980's.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's hardly a comforting comparison, which is where the economic history comes in. You see, the unaffordability of housing in the early 1980's led to an epic collapse in the housing industry. Housing starts fell from more than 2 million in 1978 to only 1.06 million in 1982. And the housing implosion was one of the main factors in the worst economic slump since the Great Depression, which brought the unemployment rate to a peak of 10.8 percent at the end of 1982.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also worth noting that the reason housing was so expensive in 1981 and 1982 was that mortgage interest rates were extremely high. That made recovery easy, because all it took to make housing affordable again was for interest rates to return to normal levels.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, with interest rates already low by historical standards, restoring affordability will require a big fall in housing prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So here's the bottom line: yes, northern Virginia, there is a housing bubble. (Northern Virginia, not Virginia as a whole. Only the Washington suburbs are in the Zoned Zone.) Part of the rise in housing values since 2000 was justified given the fall in interest rates, but at this point the overall market value of housing has lost touch with economic reality. And there's a nasty correction ahead.   </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">In New Orleans, Housing Sales Are Bright Spot  </span>
</div><div class="author">By GARY RIVLIN  </div><div>1932 words</div><div>1 January 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 31 -- A surprisingly healthy real estate market in the New Orleans metropolitan area is proving to be one bright spot in an otherwise stagnant local economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is not sizzling hot, at least by comparison to New York and San Francisco in recent years. Still, it is stronger than anyone might reasonably expect four months after Hurricane Katrina, with prices for houses in many areas at or above prestorm levels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right after the storm, if I had heard myself talking like I am now, about setting records in some offices and posting three record-breaking months in a row, I would've wondered what Kool-Aid this guy was drinking,'' said Arthur Sterbcow, the president of Latter &amp; Blum, an 89-year-old New Orleans real estate firm that bills itself as the largest on the Gulf Coast. ''But every day it gets crazier and crazier in a positive way.'' The last few months of 2005, Mr. Sterbcow said, have proven to be ''the best period in the history of our company.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is spotty, to be sure. In areas hit hard by flooding, such as the New Orleans East and Lakeview neighborhoods of the city and other communities that ring the southern edge of Lake Pontchartrain, home sales are down significantly, as only the bravest speculators are buying in these distressed communities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are plenty of buyers, with some seeking investments and others just needing a place to live after losing a home. Most people are buying ''high and dry,'' to borrow the term on every broker's lips since Katrina, but even that seems a surprising vote of confidence in the long-term prospects of New Orleans and the surrounding parishes. In the West Bank area, which lies west of the Mississippi River, November sales were up 99 percent, in dollar terms, over November 2004, according to data provided by Latter &amp; Blum. And in the high-priced Garden and Warehouse districts, the firm's November sales more than doubled.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate brokers here view the housing market's comeback as a small miracle in a city where 80 percent of homes were flooded. Don Randon, a broker who has been selling properties in New Orleans since the 1970's, described himself as ''busier over the last 10 weeks'' than at any time in his 28-year career.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while Sissy Wood, who runs her own real estate firm in Metairie, a suburb west of New Orleans, said she had not been setting records in recent months, she described the sales in her area as robust.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands of buyers are paying good money for homes and making the ultimate commitment to the area -- signing long-term mortgages when the city is still debating its rebuilding plans and while large swaths of the region remain deserted like ghost towns in the Old West. Many critical questions, including the strength of the levee system and the rules for rebuilding in flood plain areas, remain unanswered.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So with New Orleans's revival still in doubt, paying pre-Katrina prices even for a splendid piece of property on high ground may seem risky. Yet some are already speculating that, in the coming months, New Orleans will be experiencing the kind of bidding wars that occur in some markets, at least for homes in those areas that did not flood.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's coming,'' David Abbenante, the director of property management at HRI Properties, a local real estate developer. ''Just wait until people start getting their insurance checks.'' Brokers are also looking forward to an influx of buyers in June, when families with children enrolled in schools around the country are able to move back.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while it is too soon to reach definitive conclusions, real estate brokers suggest that the flight to higher ground, especially to the suburbs or to urban condominium towers that boast ''Cat 5'' windows -- those strong enough to withstand the winds of a Category 5 hurricane -- promises to reshape the housing market in the metropolitan area in the coming years. It is no wonder, since Hurricane Katrina destroyed or damaged roughly 200,000 homes in the greater New Orleans area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you have a huge amount of people displaced by flooding, like you did in New Orleans, it makes perfect sense that you have people who need to buy real estate and people who feel like they have to sell,'' said Thomas Z. Lys, a professor at Northwestern University and a director of the Guthrie Center for Real Estate Research.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Latter &amp; Blum office for the Garden and Warehouse districts, which remained fairly dry, November sales were $15.8 million, up from $7.8 million in November 2004. The increase in sales is primarily the result of volume rather than price increases, said Joan Winchell, who manages the office. ''The bulk of homes are going at pre-Katrina prices, or maybe $10,000 or $20,000 more,'' Ms. Winchell said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase has been even more dramatic in the West Bank area, which saw little flooding. Home sales jumped 159 percent, to $26.5 million in November, from $10.3 million the same month in 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And sales in the suburbs that lie just west of New Orleans soared to $29.7 million, up from $10.3 million, representing a 189 percent year-over-year increase. The sales in other suburbs around Orleans parish were up 65 percent to 162 percent in November, according to the figures provided by Latter &amp; Blum.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're hopelessly undersupplied right now in terms of what people are demanding most: homes in areas that have power and have schools in areas that did not flood,'' said Mr. Sterbcow, the company's president. Latter &amp; Blum lost two of its New Orleans offices in the flooding.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This mini-boom, at least in select areas, is due to a confluence of factors, including the presence of speculators who believe this is the perfect time to be scooping up properties.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're willing to buy flooded houses, you can find some great bargains,'' said F. Patrick Quinn III, a local real estate developer who said he has been snapping up both commercial and residential properties throughout the region. Several real estate brokers contacted said they were representing out-of-towners or corporations looking to invest in New Orleans real estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of residential buyers, agents say, are local residents who are purchasing a second home to live in while the fate of their first home is determined by insurance companies and government officials. That includes Mark Rose, who in November bought a home in Metairie after his Lakeview home was flooded. Mr. Rose is the general manager of Nola.com, a Web site that includes extensive real estate listings in the greater New Orleans area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we're seeing is a lot of homeowners trying to inflate the price of homes in areas not hit by flooding,'' Mr. Rose said. Those properties do not tend to move, he said, because a lack of available funds in people's pockets are keeping home prices relatively stable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How many people can afford two monthly mortgages, especially if the prices of the second home are inflated?'' he asked. For some people, insurance payments are helping to defray the cost of a second home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet buying a second home might still be more attractive than leasing, as the monthly cost of renting a home has spiked by 50 percent or more, according to Ms. Wood, the broker in Metairie.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Leasing is at a premium right now as so many people are looking for a place to live for 90 days to six months while things sort themselves out,'' Ms. Wood said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another sign of optimism came in December when KB Home, the California home builder, bought 3,000 acres of land in a suburb to the west of the city. The firm, which is in a partnership with the Shaw Group, a construction and engineering company based in Baton Rouge, has said it plans to build as many as 20,000 homes on the property.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Until now, we've never seen any national builder express interest in building in the New Orleans area,'' said Mr. Randon, the broker. He represented the property owner in negotiations with KB Home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The RAND Corporation has predicted that, in three years, the city of New Orleans will have a population of no more than 275,000, down more than 40 percent from its pre-Katrina population of 465,000. Much of the decline will come from evacuees who do not return, while some former city residents will move to the suburbs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think what we'll see is a morphing of the residential property market,'' Mr. Randon said. The demand for homes on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, which is at less risk of flooding, and for homes in high-and-dry suburban communities, will prove a factor that will help reshape the metropolitan area, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another could be the lure of condominiums, which offer people a chance to live high above sea level. The New Orleans condo market was hot prior to Katrina, but Mr. Randon predicts the market will be ''very, very, very strong in the coming months,'' in no small part because of empty-nesters like him and his wife. With a daughter in college and a huge bill to fix up a flood-damaged home, ''I think we're like a lot of people in asking, 'Do we really need a big house or would we be better off moving into a condo more in the center of town?' '' Mr. Randon said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, there has not been any spike in condo prices, according to Sean Talbot, of the Talbot Realty Group, which specializes in condominium sales. ''We've been busy, but not as productive as we had been before the storm,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Talbot was the only one of the dozen-plus brokers, bankers and developers contacted for this article to sound a skeptical note about post-Katrina business. Still, he is hardly pessimistic about the local real estate market. He described business in recent weeks as only ''decent,'' but he added, ''things are starting to happen and getting better every week.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON paper, they could pass for 40-year-olds. They are homeowners living in the Middle of Nowhere, U.S.A., deep in the suburbs of suburbia. They commute an hour to work. They live next door to farmland. They pay mortgages and contemplate amortization schedules and property taxes. They like yard work and quiet nights, and they don't make it into the city much anymore.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these mature homeowners are the youngest of the young in real estate terms, buyers who are 25 years and younger. While their friends live in cramped apartments and downtown lofts, small flocks of young adults across the country are forgoing places like Hell's Kitchen or the Castro district for subdivisions named Castlegate and Churchill Club. They are choosing the far-flung exurbs of America.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They give up nightclubs, art galleries and the frenetic urban thrum that serves as a soundtrack for so many people in their 20's. In return, these buyers get new homes, cheap land and the promise of being pioneers in communities rising from old wheat fields and sod farms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers, quick to catch on, are starting to advertise on college campuses and in apartment complexes occupied by young renters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were surprised by the number of 20-somethings out there who were buying,'' said Scott Smith, president of Great Western Homes near Phoenix, which is a unit of K. Hovnanian Homes. ''We thought it was purely an affordability issue, but they said they wanted to be on the outer edges.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Younger buyers helped fuel the real estate boom that sent prices for houses soaring over the last four years. Wary of the stock market, they sprang at low interest rates and riskier financing methods like interest-only loans.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no statistics that break down exactly where the youngest buyers are purchasing homes, but census data show their strength. Homeowners younger than 25 still make up the smallest fraction of all owners, but their numbers are growing faster than any other age group, more than doubling since 1994.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported that 12 percent of first-time buyers are under 25. Though the under-25 buyer makes up only 1 percent of all homeowners nationally, several exurban developers said these young buyers represent 7 to 12 percent of their sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers like Ashley Candelaria, 21, who owns a home on the mesas of New Mexico, now represent a new starting point in the housing market, one that developers say has upended the entrenched narrative of homeowner evolution.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, the story went like this: With their buying power crimped by college debt, entry-level salaries and meager savings accounts, many of the youngest buyers started small. They bought studio apartments, one-bedroom bungalows or modest town houses in desirable neighborhoods or commuter suburbs, sacrificing space for location. They traded up for more space as they had children, received promotions, bought second cars and accrued more and more stuff.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, ''the 20-somethings don't have the same attitude,'' said Mr. Smith, the developer. ''They're willing to do whatever they can to get it now. They're willing to take a leap.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chad Horne, president of Windward Homes in Tampa, Fla., another branch of Hovnanian Homes, said an 1,800-square-foot house on a one-tenth-acre lot close to the city costs more than a 2,200-square-foot home on a quarter acre in far-flung Pasco County. Younger buyers often take the bigger, more distant house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Candelaria was still in high school when she decided to buy a house, and saved everything from jobs at J. C. Penney and local hair salons. Once she graduated and got an administrative job at a center for mentally disabled adults, she began scouring the outer-ring suburbs of Albuquerque for a home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seven months of seeing homes that were either too shabby or too expensive, Ms. Candelaria said she stumbled onto a sales office for KB Home, a developer that was building a subdivision in the desert. For $119,000 -- about half of the national median home price, $220,000 -- Ms. Candelaria got a new three-bedroom house with a tile roof and a yard for her dog, Roxy, a German shepherd-Rottweiler mix.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A young family lives on one side of Ms. Candelaria; on the other, an elderly woman who marveled that Ms. Candelaria had become a homeowner at 20.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even though I'm young, partying isn't a priority for me,'' Ms. Candelaria said. ''Where I'm going to sleep at night is more of a priority. I don't mind the fact that I have to drive awhile if I want to get to the clubs.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Queen Creek, Ariz., about 95 miles north of Tucson, Alan and Jenny Bradford, both 25, pay the price of distance in gasoline and time. They bought a $127,900 three-bedroom in the Castlegate subdivision, an affordable but far-flung community connected to highways by an overburdened two-lane road. The Bradfords have a pool in the backyard, but have to drive 20 minutes to get to the grocery store. ''Sometimes, it'll take me two hours to get to work,'' said Mr. Bradford.But those clogged roads symbolized growth and development, harbingers that the Bradfords' investment was paying off. A neighbor across the street recently sold out for $240,000, and Mr. Bradford expects to fare even better when he sells his house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Looking back, it's the best decision we've made,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some young buyers have come to love the allure of the far-flung suburbs. The skies are dark at night, and nature preserves or forests abut their subdivisions. They are remote enough to walk the dog down the middle of the road, but near enough to suburban staples like Wal-Mart and Applebee's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britni Wood, 25, a teacher in Springs, Tex., north of Houston, said she feels more rooted on the covered patio of her $116,000 house than surrounded by Houston's skyscrapers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know where I am,'' she said. ''This is a home, and this is a neighborhood. Downtown, you don't have that sense.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often, buyers say the exurbs and their new homes are little more than a springboard to more money or something better. Before Bryan Hollermeier bought a home in Littleton, Colo., at age 23, he said, he debated buying a loft in downtown Denver. His friends lived in the city, and he drove downtown on weekend nights to dance at hip-hop clubs. But while the downtown lofts had modest resale values, the new homes south of town seemed undervalued and ripe to appreciate. He pounced and bought a 1,600-square-foot house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I made my decision based on investment -- whether it will appreciate and whether I can sell if the market turns bad,'' Mr. Hollermeier said. ''I'm pretty conservative with savings. I'm 25 and should probably be having fun, but I have a budget.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hollermeier said he hopes to earn enough buying and selling homes to retire by age 40.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For other young buyers in the exurbs, trading up is a means to a different end. Tom Wasberg, who owns a split-level three-bedroom home in Woodstock, Ill., about an hour west of Chicago, plans to stay for three to five years and sell. He plans to use the profits to buy again, as close to the city as possible.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PORTLAND, Me. -- Despite a widespread sense that real estate has never been more expensive, families in the vast majority of the country can still buy a house for a smaller share of their income than they could have a generation ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sharp fall in mortgage rates since the early 1980's, a decline in mortgage fees and a rise in incomes have more than made up for rising house prices in almost every place outside of New York, Washington, Miami and along the coast in California. These often-overlooked changes are a major reason that most economists do not expect a broad drop in prices in 2006, even though many once-booming markets on the coasts have started weakening.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-term decline in housing costs also helps explain why the homeownership rate remains near a record of almost 69 percent, up from 65 percent a decade ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, a family earning the median income -- the exact middle of all incomes -- would have to spend 22 percent of its pretax pay this year on mortgage payments to buy the median-priced house, according to an analysis by Moody's Economy.com, a research company.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share has increased since 1998, when it hit a low of 17 percent before house prices began rising sharply in many places. Although the overall level has reached its highest point since 1989, it remains well below the levels of the early 1980's, when it topped 30 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a good deal -- a good, fair price,'' Dale Ruttenberg, a 53-year-old bar manager said of a tan one-bedroom bungalow, with a remodeled kitchen and finished hardwood floors, that he is buying for $211,000 after having rented in Portland for most of the last decade. ''Within a couple hours of being here, it was like, 'I'm home.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In high-profile places like New York and Los Angeles, home to many of the people who study and write about real estate, families buying their first home often must spend more than half of their income on mortgage payments, far more than they once did. But the places that have become less affordable over the last generation account for only a quarter of the country's population.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, families tend to spend far less on housing. In Dallas, the share of income needed to buy a typical house has fallen to 13 percent this year, from 14 percent in 1995 and 31 percent in 1980. In Tampa, it has dropped to 21 percent, from 26 percent in 1980. Even in New England, where the soaring prices of the last decades have frustrated many young families, house values have still not reached the heights of the early 1980's, when calculated as a share of income.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over 20 years, affordability has definitely improved because interest rates are much lower,'' said Kenneth T. Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Research at the University of California, Berkeley. Houses have also grown bigger during that time, he said, so people are getting more for their money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in Portland, a smaller version of the big-city real estate boom has been in full swing until just the last few months. House prices have jumped since 2000, hundreds of new real estate agents have gotten their licenses and an old factory along the waterfront, once famous for making bright-red hot dogs, is set to be replaced with condominiums.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With many suburban houses now selling for $300,000 and up, young families have a much harder time buying their first home than they did a few years ago. Still, housing has been less expensive this year -- as a share of local incomes -- than at any point during the 1980's, according to Moody's Economy.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond cost, many families who simply could not have bought a house 10 or 20 years ago find themselves able to do so, thanks to changes in the ways banks lend money. In the past, a home buyer often needed to make a down payment equal to 20 percent of a house's value to get a mortgage; today, little or no down payment is common.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most money that Tim W. Gilbert has ever had in his possession was $15,000, he said, in the form of a check for a job he had done as a carpenter. But he and his wife, Marjorie, were still able to buy a 1936 Cape Cod-style house this year for $176,000 in Poland, about 45 minutes north of Portland.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They took out two mortgages rather than making a down payment and they use Mr. Gilbert's $5,000 or so in pretax monthly income to cover $1,600 in mortgage, tax and insurance payments. Ms. Gilbert, a writer, home schools their daughters, ages 4 and 6. ''I paid rent for 18 or 19 years,'' Mr. Gilbert, 38, said. ''We waited years and years. We wanted to make this happen.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If almost anything had been different -- if interest rates had been higher or if the bank had required a down payment -- the Gilberts would still be living in an apartment underneath a loud landlord, Mr. Gilbert said. Instead, their house sits on three acres, and they get their tap water from the same source as the Poland Spring Water Company.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're making this work,'' he said. ''It doesn't mean things are a lot easier, but finally we are in control. It's been a long time coming.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moody's Economy.com calculations took into account the decline in down payment size in recent years. But even though these lower down payments mean home buyers are taking out loans equal to a larger share of a house's price than in the past, monthly payments have remained reasonable in much of the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp fall in mortgage rates -- from above 10 percent through most of the 1980's to less than 6 percent in the last few years -- is the main reason. Upfront mortgage fees have also dropped to about a third of a percentage point of a loan's value, from 2.5 percent 20 years ago. Computers have made lenders more efficient, and huge pools of global capital have brought more competition to a business that was once largely local.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the list prices of houses are climbing as they have in recent years, it can be hard to imagine that real estate is more affordable than it once was. In a nationwide New York Times/CBS News poll conducted this month, 75 percent of respondents said they thought most families in their community spent a larger share of their income on housing now than in the 1980's. Only 5 percent said the share was smaller.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possible reason for the perception is that many families have recently taken on mortgage debt to pay for items other than housing. Some have folded higher interest loans, like credit card debt, into their mortgage, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. Others have used home equity loans to pay for a new car, tuition or even a vacation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has caused mortgage payments to rise over the last generation -- especially among high-income families, according to Federal Reserve data -- for reasons besides the cost of housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the monthly payments needed to buy a house still seem to be dictating people's behavior, if not their perceptions. The number of home sales has reached a record this year, according to the National Association of Realtors. In the Times/CBS poll, 90 percent of respondents said they were satisfied with their homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People aren't really shopping prices,'' said Bill Trask, a broker at Coldwell Banker Friends and Neighbors Realty in suburban Portland. ''They're shopping payments.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Muncie recently bought his first home, a 1,000-square-foot condominium with a sunken living room and exposed beams in Portland's West End, for $169,000. It is part of a house built in 1838; a similar apartment in the building sold for $81,000 in 1990, according to real estate records.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That increase starts to look less striking, though, when viewed in light of family incomes that have grown more than 50 percent in Portland over the same span and interest rates that have fallen nearly in half.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I walked away thinking I'm getting a bargain,'' said Mr. Muncie, 36, a psychologist. ''I was actually pleasantly surprised.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median-earning family in the Portland area would need to spend about 23 percent of its pretax income on mortgage payments for a typical house this year, down from about 27 percent for much of the 1980's. But it is up sharply from the low of 16 percent reached in 1999, and some people here said the cost of housing has become onerous again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With mortgage rates having inched up in recent months, houses are taking longer to sell, and asking prices have dropped. Homes that would have sold for $300,000 this summer are now selling for about $285,000, said Rita Yarnold, president of Bay Realty.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has also slowed in California and most other places where housing costs have risen far more rapidly than in Maine. In New York, the median-earning family would have to spend about half its income on the mortgage payments for a median-priced house, up from a third of its income in 1985. That will act as a drag on house prices in coming years, many economists say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you get affordability stretched so much, all the creative financing in the world can't stop some correction of house prices,'' Mr. Rosen, the University of California economist, said. ''It happened in Hong Kong, Japan and England.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It looks as if it may not happen, though, in most of the United States.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller share of income is needed to buy house now than it was 20 years ago across much of United States; sharp fall in mortgage rates since early 1980's, decline in mortgage fees and rise in incomes make up for rising house prices in almost every place outside of New York, Washington, Miami and California coast; most economists do not expect broad drop in prices in 2006, even though many once-booming markets on coasts have started weakening; long-term decline in housing costs helps explain why homeownership rate remains near record 69 percent, up from 65 percent decade ago; analysis by Moody's finds that nationwide, family earning median income would have to spend 22 percent of its pretax pay this year on mortgage payments to buy median-priced house, rather than 30 percent in early 1980's; share hit low of 17 percent in 1998, before house prices began rising sharply; in New York and Los Angeles, families often spend more than half their income on mortgage payments; but these and other   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building picked up speed in November, the government reported yesterday, indicating that the housing market in much of the country remains robust, though below records set earlier this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Labor Department report, also released yesterday, showed that the Producer Price Index fell by 0.7 percent last month as energy prices fell 4 percent. Prices excluding the volatile energy and food sectors were up 0.1 percent from October, less than economists had expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken together, the reports further supported the opinion of many analysts that the economy has recovered from much of the damage inflicted by high energy prices and the hurricanes and is poised to end 2005 on a high note.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major concern in the last few months has been the health of the nation's long housing boom, which has shown signs of slowing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said housing starts increased 5.3 percent last month, to an annual rate of 2.2 million, from the month before and was 17.5 percent higher than in November 2004. Permits for new housing, a measure that indicates future construction, were up 2.5 percent for the month and 3 percent for the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing start statistics have a significant margin of error -- plus or minus 7.7 percent for the monthly change and 6.8 percent for the annual change -- suggesting that the figures are likely to be revised up or down as more data is collected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no question that we are going out in this year with a lot of momentum,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, a research firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That momentum will carry us through at least the first half of next year,'' he said, but added that construction would slow in the second half of the year as mortgage interest rates continue to rise and the benefits of reconstruction on the Gulf Coast taper off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he expected the annualized monthly rate to slip to 1.84 million homes in the second half of the year, down from the 2.2 million in November of this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates, at historic lows for much of the year, have recently climbed to a national average of 6.3 percent for a 30-year fixed mortgage last week, from a low of 5.53 percent in June, according to Freddie Mac. Mortgage rates are expected to rise further because the Federal Reserve has indicated it will continue to raise interest rates in the new year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, particularly for new homes, has proved forecasters, and even home builders, wrong in recent months. The National Association of Home Builders said Monday that an index that measures the confidence of its members fell 4 points this month, to 57.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While still considered an optimistic reading, the decline was the second consecutive monthly one and it left the index at its lowest level in more than three years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders surveyed said they were offering more promotions to lure buyers, who are increasingly resisting higher home prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the broader inflation front, prices also appear to be cooling off, mostly because of lower energy prices. At the wholesale level, gasoline prices dropped 10.7 percent and heating oil tumbled 15.5 percent last month after increasing by similarly large numbers in September and October. Prices for cars and light trucks fell 0.8 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the November price declines have not made up completely for the sharp increase in energy prices earlier this year. The Producer Price Index, which in contrast to the Consumer Price Index does not include distribution costs, subsidies and taxes, was up 4.4 percent from November 2004; excluding energy and food it was up 1.7 percent for the 12 months.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the Editor:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inequity of real estate tax burdens (''When It Comes to Taxes, Older is Better,'' Dec. 11) is not limited to New York City but pervades the state. As mentioned, New York State law requires co-op and condominium units to be assessed for ad valorem tax purposes as though they were part of a rental apartment building. One of many examples I have examined recently shows the owner of a $150,000 condominium in White Plains pays $1,100 in real estate taxes, while the owner of a $150,000 single-family house pays $6,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In communities with high ratios of co-ops and condos to single-family houses, this legislated inequity places an especially untoward tax burden on the homeowner, not to mention on owners of nonresidential properties.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, the courts may have to address this inequity to overcome the wariness of politicians' tampering with anything they may perceive as increasing voters' taxes.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF you're counting on a light week because you don't think that much market-moving news can break just before the holidays, think again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services, will be keeping an eye on several indicators of housing activity -- especially the report on November sales of new homes that is to be released on Friday. A Bloomberg News poll of economists predicts a decline to an annual rate of 1.310 million homes from the record 1.424 million reported for October, but Mr. Cheney suspects that the number will be worse than forecast and that Wall Street will not be pleased.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've had some mixed signals from the housing market, but on the whole the data suggests it keeps rolling along, even when there are all kinds of anecdotes suggesting the market is softening,'' he said. ''It's high time we saw some negative data because I think these anecdotes mean something.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That high time is unlikely to be Tuesday, when housing starts are announced, Mr. Cheney said. Building permits were strong last month, and what is permitted tends to be built.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a lot of construction still in the pipeline,'' he said. ''Building is fine, but are the builders selling the houses?'' He thinks not, or at least that they are not selling them as robustly as many economists believe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bloomberg News consensus forecast would be a good number, Mr. Cheney said. It would mean a decline in home sales at an annual rate of 114,000, but in his opinion, the rate ''could drop by 200,000, and if it dropped a lot more than that, it would be a sign that the market is cooling off.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' enthusiasm for buying items smaller than houses might then cool off, too, and that could harm the economy and the stock market, he warned.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would certainly take it as a significant hint that the housing sector is slowing down,'' he said, ''and that in turn is a major driver for the economy as a whole.'' Sluggishness in housing ''will subtract from demand for everything,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''People will feel a little poorer.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DATA WATCH -- Mr. Cheney will also be focusing on the University of Michigan report, due Friday, on consumer sentiment for this month. He expects a cheerier reading than the one on home sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is some evidence we could get another step up'' as the psychological rebound from the summer hurricanes continues in tandem with the tangible recovery, he said. The Bloomberg News survey predicts a reading of 89.0, up from 88.7 last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sentiment report provides ''the most current of all the numbers coming out next week,'' Mr. Cheney noted, and an improvement ''would probably be interpreted by the markets very positively.''  </p>
