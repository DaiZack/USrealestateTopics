<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grosse Pointe, Mich. -- WHAT is striking about the mansions and tree-lined roads of this exclusive suburb of Detroit is not the elegance and wealth -- it's the real estate signs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost 700 homes are currently on the market in the five Grosse Pointe communities, according to brokers, twice as many as in the same time in 2005. And since June, prices for the most expensive houses have dropped by around $100,000 a month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since the mid-19th century, when the first grand summer mansions were built along the shores of Lake St. Clair, just north of Detroit, the name Grosse Pointe has conveyed exclusivity and wealth. While nearby Detroit declined over the last five decades, this affluent suburb thrived, with some episodic downturns in the early 1980s and 1990s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its untouchable reputation held up so well that in 2001 the former WB Network aired ''Grosse Pointe,'' a prime-time drama about pampered teenagers. Now, six years later, Grosse Pointe is very much touched by market trends.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the greater Detroit area have fallen by 20 percent, and in many instances more than that, in just a year. Homes that sold for $450,000 in 2006 have typically sold for $360,000 or less in 2007, real estate agents say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resulting market here in southeast Michigan has created a legion of frustrated sellers and plenty of opportunity for choosy buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Alice O'Toole, a sales representative, raised four children and spent 32 years in the Grosse Pointe Woods home that she and her husband, Joe, bought in 1975 for $85,000. (They spent $100,000 more for an addition in 1982.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are hoping to sell their home -- a 3,500-square-foot brick colonial with five bedrooms and three and a half baths -- for $479,000. Originally, it went on the market in June for $549,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we've had seven people go through, and two people are interested,'' Mrs. O'Toole said, ''but no offers.'' The couple are planning to move to downtown Chicago, where Mr. O'Toole will start a new job.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other Oakland County enclaves that rival Grosse Pointe -- Birmingham, Bloomfield and Bloomfield Township -- the real estate market is just as soft. According to housing sales data compiled by Bob Taylor, an agent and researcher in Birmingham with Weir Manuel Realtors, sales peaked in the Birmingham and Bloomfield region in the second quarter of 2004, when 281 homes sold for an average price of $528,000 and a median price of $395,500. At the time, homes stayed on the market an average of 65 days.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter of 2007, just 173 houses were sold in the three communities, he said. They stayed on the market for an average of 174 days, though prices were up, to an average of $605,828 and a median price of $446,750.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, there are nearly 41,000 homes on the market in Detroit and its three surrounding counties, twice as many as in 2005.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't invent buyers,'' said Mr. Taylor, who noted that in 2004, his agency had an average of six open houses for each listing. This year, it had just two for every listing. ''These numbers prove what we've experienced,'' he said. ''There are substantially less people looking in this market.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Michigan has lost 369,000 jobs since 2000, according to an analysis by the University of Michigan, with 60 percent of those positions coming from the Detroit region alone. Many of those jobs have been from higher-paying manufacturing positions related to designing and building cars and trucks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state's unemployment rate of 7.7 percent in October is the highest in the nation, and adjusting for inflation, its median income has fallen 12 percent since 2000, according to the Labor Department.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crisis in the mortgage industry has struck hard here, too, especially for those who bought their homes with adjustable-rate financing. As of last month, 60 homes had been foreclosed in Grosse Pointe; at the same time last year there were 16, according to the Michigan Multiple Listing Service.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that tastes have changed as well. Young high-earning professionals prefer newer homes, and will settle for older homes only if they have been completely updated. The 1920s homes in Grosse Pointe and Birmingham that have not undergone extensive remodeling are not nearly as attractive as they once were.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tamara Smith, an agent with Coldwell Banker Schweitzer Real Estate in Grosse Pointe, says the hardest part of her job is persuading sellers to be realistic about how much they can ask for their home when it's put on the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They come in with a number in mind, and it's just way out of the realm of possibility,'' she said. ''And even if we work to get the right price, I tell them it could be 12 to 18 months.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Smith says brokers and sellers are deploying every strategy they can think of to market homes, like hiring professional ''stagers'' to tidy yards and redecorate interiors to make homes more inviting to buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has helped. In the first 10 months of this year, 592 homes were sold in the five Grosse Pointe cities, according to Mrs. Smith. During the same period last year, 465 homes were sold, she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling prices mean that buyers are finding what they view as bargains.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George C. Watson, a 57-year-old lawyer, and his partner, John Fitzpatrick, 44, a communications manager for  <span class="companylink">Aramark</span> in Detroit, went into contract in October on a ranch house in Grosse Pointe Shores with three bedrooms, two bathrooms and 2,100 square feet of living space. They paid $340,000. Two years ago, Mr. Watson said, the same home would have cost $450,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Watson is concerned about the market's instability, but said he planned to stay in the house for many years and believed the market would rebound before he needed to sell.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chuck Rizzo, the owner of a waste-hauling company, is a seller and a buyer. He has two homes listed for sale in Grosse Pointe; one has been on the market since 2006 and the other since June. Neither has had any offers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Mr. Rizzo bought a 5,900-square-foot home in Bloomfield Township for $1.5 million -- $500,000 less than the asking price. ''On that one I did well,'' he said, explaining that personal circumstances involving his young son prompted him to move to a new school district. ''With the other ones, I'm dying,'' added Mr. Rizzo, who is 37. ''There's just no security in this market.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other affluent real estate markets around the country like Palm Beach, Fla.; Orange County, Calif.; and Scottsdale, Ariz., inventories of expensive homes are growing and prices are falling, according to brokers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People in this business much older than me say they've never seen anything like it,'' said Keith Stonehouse, a vice president with the Franklin Title Agency who teaches professional development seminars, like the ''Reality of Realty,'' in the region.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I saw a guy buy a house for $2.1 million in Bloomfield last year -- a brand-new house,'' Mr. Stonehouse said. ''He got hit by the economy and never moved in. Now the house is on the market for $950,000, and it might not sell for that much.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you buy a house, it isn't supposed to work this way. Among homes bought in the last year, nearly 16 percent are now worth less than the amount of the original mortgage, according to third-quarter data from Zillow, a real estate research firm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California is a kind of negative-equity vortex right now. In five areas -- Merced, Stockton-Lodi, Modesto, El Centro and Yuba City -- the median percentage of equity among homes bought in the last year is a negative number (from minus 2 percent in Yuba City to minus 13 percent in Merced).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new numbers are especially bad news for people who can no longer afford their mortgage payments, who need to sell their homes in a hurry or who flip houses for a living.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the years tend to be kind to people who can stay put in their homes. Based on Zillow's data, more than 98 percent of people who bought a house five years ago are in the black by now.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE Federal Reserve Board forecast this week that there will be no recession in the United States in the foreseeable future. It says the gross domestic product will grow by as little as 1.6 percent in 2008, but is confident that growth will accelerate after that.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That forecast -- the first formally issued by the Fed in line with its effort to be more transparent -- was released the same day that the Census Bureau reported a continued slowing of housing starts. The number of new homes being built is now little more than half the level of two years ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Fed is right, and the economy does stay out of recession, with the unemployment rate barely rising at all, then it will be the first time ever that a housing slowdown this severe has not coincided with a recession. In fact, there has never been a slowdown of anything like this magnitude until after a recession was under way.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minutes of the October meeting of the Fed's open market committee, which were released along with the forecast, conceded that there was a risk of a downturn. ''Participants were concerned about the possibility for adverse feedbacks in which economic weakness could lead to further tightening in credit conditions, which could in turn slow the economy further,'' the minutes reported.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed said there was also a risk from ''a more severe contraction in the housing sector and a substantial decline in house prices.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Fed officials also concluded that ''in recent decades, the U.S. economy had proved quite resilient to episodes of financial distress, suggesting that the adverse effects of financial developments on economic activity outside of the housing sector could prove to be more modest than anticipated.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the accompanying charts show, the decline in housing starts has been rapid and sudden, particularly for single-family homes. Such violent swings were more common decades ago, when increases in short-term interest rates could shut off deposits for savings and loan institutions. At the time, the savings and loans were limited by law from raising deposit rates too far. That made mortgages hard to get until rates came down.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling home prices and tougher lending standards may be having a similar effect now.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second chart shows two-year changes in home starts, again measured by three-month moving averages to smooth out weather-related distortions. The rate of new-home starts from August through October -- as the mortgage crisis took hold -- was down 47 percent from the same months of 2005.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the early 1960s, when the data became available, there have only been three previous cycles when starts fell by at least a third over two years. By the first month with such a decline in each of those cycles -- January 1974, March 1980 and January 1991 -- a recession was under way.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been recessions without such a large impact on housing, most notably the 2001 downturn. But the housing market has never done this poorly without a recession starting.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM   </div><div>958 words</div><div>21 November 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Losses at  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> underscored the continuing turmoil in the housing industry yesterday, and other developments reinforced the sense that conditions would not improve soon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the big mortgage finance company, posted a $2 billion loss for the third quarter and warned that it might not have enough capital on hand to cover the mandatory reserves for its mortgage commitments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has been battered by a rising wave of foreclosures tied to subprime mortgage defaults, and it is ''seriously considering'' cutting its stock dividend.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie's misfortune is particularly rattling because the company is considered something of a backstop for the lending industry. With its implied guarantee of government backing, the housing market looks to Freddie, and its bigger sibling, Fannie Mae, to provide stable credit and financing for a wide swath of mortgages.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But yesterday's earnings report showed that even the gold standard of lending agencies was not immune to the toxic subprime securities that have infected much of the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss included a provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion, and it wrote down the value of some assets by $3.6 billion. And Freddie's outlook remained cloudy: executives said they did not expect earnings to improve in the fourth quarter, and they suggested that the government would not lower its 30 percent threshold for Freddie's reserves.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of the company plummeted 28.7 percent, to $26.74, its lowest level in 11 years, while shares of Fannie Mae dropped 24.8 percent. Freddie will seek advice from  <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and  <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> for its short-term efforts to shore up its reserves.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many analysts said the poor earnings suggested that subprime problems had spread to new corners of the mortgage market, some said that they did not anticipate a significant tightening in Freddie's lending standards.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the reasons why they are trying to do a significant capital raise is they want to be out there continuing to provide credit,'' said Frederick Cannon, a managing director at  <span class="companylink">Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods</span>, who covers the housing sector.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the agencies' exposure could also restrict the government's ability to intervene in the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It makes any potential large federal response that much more difficult,'' said Joseph Brusuelas, chief United States economist at IdeaGlobal. ''If the federal government were to respond aggressively to a greater-than-expected downturn in the housing sector, it would rely on Fannie and Freddie to do a lot of the heavy lifting.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Freddie's case, the company warned about more problems in the coming months. ''Without doubt, 2007 has been an extremely difficult year for the country's housing and credit markets,'' Richard F. Syron,  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Syron was not alone in his lament. D. R. Horton, the nation's largest home builder, reported a $50.1 million loss in its fiscal fourth quarter as the housing downturn pummeled its inventory, good will and land-use contracts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower demand and tighter lending standards have cut back the company's business and caused many clients to cancel contracts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect the housing environment to remain challenging,'' Donald R. Horton, the company's chairman, said in a statement.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subprime debacle also claimed another prominent casualty yesterday. The chairman and chief executive of  <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block</span>, Mark Ernst, said he would resign amid the company's difficulties with subprime exposure. Mr. Ernst had come under fire for the failed sale of the  <span class="companylink">Option One Mortgage Corporation</span>, a company subsidiary that took heavy losses on risky loans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His successor as chairman will be Richard C. Breeden, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who was recently elected to  <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block</span>'s board after sharply criticizing Mr. Ernst.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief executive slot will be temporarily filled by Alan M. Bennett, a former top executive at  <span class="companylink">Aetna</span>, the insurance company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And home-building data released yesterday offered no hint of an end to housing troubles. Permits to break ground fell 6.6 percent in October to their lowest level in more than 14 years, a sign that builders are cutting back on residential home projects.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits have dipped nearly 25 percent since last October, to a seasonally adjusted 1.18 million annual rate, the Commerce Department said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New residential construction grew slightly last month, rising 3 percent, to an annual pace of 1.23 million. It was the first increase in four months, but the increase came mostly from a 44 percent jump in multifamily developments, like condominiums.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes dropped again last month, and housing starts over all remain near their lowest level since the recession of the early 1990s. ''With mortgage financing further constrained and inventories of unsold homes quite high, the near-to-medium term outlook for housing starts is not good,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR, wrote in a research note.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be unfortunate for  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, whose mortgage-related securities rapidly lost their value as the subprime market began to collapse. Freddie lost $3.29 a share in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $715 million, or $1.17 a share, in the period a year earlier. The company also said it did not expect earnings to improve in the fourth quarter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not happy about this,'' Mr. Syron, Freddie's chairman, told investors and shareholders on a conference call. ''We don't expect you to be happy about it.''   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN it comes to buying and renovating Manhattan town houses, the whole is often greater -- millions of dollars greater -- than the sum of its parts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, David L. Jasper, a trader at  <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, and his wife, Elizabeth Turner, bought a 21-foot-wide four-family brownstone on West 75th Street, just off Central Park, for $5.3 million and set about the laborious process of converting it into a single-family house.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, with the work nearly done, property records show, they sold it for $14.1 million, one of the highest prices ever paid for a town house on the Upper West Side.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Sieger, a broker at Fenwick Keats Goodstein, said that the couple bought the house to live in it. ''They decided to sell after I told them how much I could get for it,'' Mr. Sieger said. He listed the house for $16 million, figuring the allure of a freshly renovated house, and 9,000 square feet of space (including a recreation room in the cellar), would be irresistible.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, the couple bought a narrower house, at 18 feet wide, on West 88th Street, one block farther away from the park, for $3.1 million, but they sold it four months later, for $4.2 million, or a 34 percent gain.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer of the house on 75th Street is Alston Gardner, a venture capitalist who was the founder and chief executive of OnTarget, a sales training and consulting company. OnTarget was sold in 1999 for $259 million to  <span class="companylink">Siebel Systems</span>, which, in turn, was sold to the  <span class="companylink">Oracle Corporation</span> in 2005.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Moulin, a designer and contractor who is renovating the house on 75th Street, said the work was 90 to 95 percent complete and would be done in about three months. ''The house was grand and we brought it back,'' he said. The sellers are traveling and cannot be reached for comment, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, the director of research at Brown Harris Stevens, said the sale price ranked second for one-family town houses on the Upper West Side. The highest-priced Upper West Side town house in his records was the $15.5 million sale by Abigail Disney, a scion of the  <span class="companylink">Disney</span> family, in October 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer of the  <span class="companylink">Disney</span> house was Keith Monda, the president of  <span class="companylink">Coach Inc.</span> That house was also refurbished. It included a lap pool and a circular staircase and was listed as recently renovated to a ''state of the art architectural masterpiece.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE holiday season begins this week, but if you expect Champagne corks to pop on Wall Street, prepare to be disappointed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further depressing news from the housing market is likely to curb the urge to make merry, and nervousness among retailers could also damp the mood, said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist at  <span class="companylink">Eaton Vance</span>, the fund manager in Boston. The two factors are related, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Quite clearly, the housing sector is in a recession,'' he said, ''and that's taking a big chunk out of the ability of people to have cash to spend.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The snapshot on Tuesday of housing-market conditions ''is probably going to tell us more of the same,'' he predicted. A Bloomberg News poll of economists forecasts that the report on October housing starts will show a decline to an annual rate of 1.170 million from 1.191 million in September. A decline is also seen in building permits, to a 1.190 million annualized rate from 1.226 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. MacIntosh anticipates numbers that are at least that bad. ''Housing is pretty grim,'' he said. ''I don't think there will be any surprises there. The numbers always seem to come in a little worse than expectations.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakness in housing is making retailers lose sleep -- literally. Black Friday -- as the day after Thanksgiving is called because it was, historically, the time when stores turned a profit, or went into the black, for the year -- will have an early start. Some chains plan to open at midnight rather than at 6 a.m.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That tells me they're pretty worried about sales this season,'' Mr. MacIntosh said. He noted that chain stores have been reporting annualized sales gains around 1.5 percent instead of the more typical 3 percent to 4 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. MacIntosh harbors some apprehensions of his own as he contemplates the short-term outlook for the stock market. The weak conditions in two such important segments of the economy are likely to put a lid on share prices, he warned.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a hard time seeing huge rallies,'' he said. ''This just isn't a period here in our economy where we're going to get good earnings growth.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DATA WATCH If Americans are becoming gloomier, another sign of it may arrive Friday, when the University of Michigan issues its final reading of consumer confidence for November. The Bloomberg poll calls for no change from the earlier reading this month of 75. Mr. MacIntosh points out, however, that the number has been eroding steadily over the last few months.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AMONG the items that Tom Bird gave to charity last year was what he considered a ''lingering asset'' on his personal balance sheet: the domain name, farm.com, which he retained when he and his business partner sold their Silicon Valley record storage company, First American Record Management (FARM) in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sensing a ready market for the dormant address, Mr. Bird, who is now a venture capitalist, approached the Boston Foundation about taking it. The charity readily agreed, and within a month sold it for $200,000. Mr. Bird got a corresponding tax write-off for his donation, which had cost him nothing but a nominal registration fee 18 years earlier and annual renewal fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contribution is one example of how innovative donors and open-minded charities are moving beyond traditional gifts of cash and marketable securities and benefiting from donations of noncash assets. Although real estate remains the most popular type of noncash gift, charities have also accepted tangible personal property like art, jewelry and collectibles, and intangible assets like patents or shares in a closely held business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statistics are scarce, but Ruben D. Orduña, vice president of the Boston Foundation, said that most of the organization's larger gifts last year included a noncash asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Often the kinds of assets that wealthy people have available to donate are things other than cash and marketable securities,'' Mr. Orduña said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such donations require donors to navigate potential tax traps, have the property appraised, and find an appreciative recipient who will most often sell the asset. But for those who make the effort, it provides an alternative to checkbook philanthropy and a way to still give regardless of stock market performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bryan Clontz, president of Charitable Solutions, a Jacksonville, Fla., firm that helps charities liquidate noncash assets, said he got more calls about these types of donations when the market was down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with publicly traded securities, there are tax incentives for the donor to make gifts of property that has gone up in value, said Ralph E. Lerner, a lawyer with <span class="companylink">Sidley Austin Brown &amp; Wood</span>, in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One is the savings in long-term capital gains tax, which is 15 percent for sales of appreciated business interests and real estate held at least 12 months, and 28 percent for tangible personal property like art and collectibles. Since the charity is tax exempt, it generally pays no tax when it sells the asset. In the best-case scenario, you can also deduct the fair-market value of the asset at the time of the donation, rather than what you paid for it. When making gifts to a public charity, donors are entitled to a deduction for up to 30 percent of adjusted gross income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any deduction that can't be taken in the year of the donation -- say, because the donor's income isn't high enough -- can be carried forward up to five years. Alistair Barnes, a property manager with Global Special Risks in Houston, figures that his donation of a 3 percent share in the company, a privately held insurance firm, two months before its May 2007 sale, will entitle him to a $292,000 deduction in April. For tangible personal property, something you can touch and move, a restriction known as the related-use rule applies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For your donation to qualify for a full fair-market value deduction, the charity must use the asset in a way that is related to its exempt purpose, said Conrad Teitell, a lawyer with <span class="companylink">Cummings &amp; Lockwood</span> in Stamford, Conn. Otherwise, your income-tax deduction is limited to your basis in the asset (what it initially cost you) or its fair market value, whichever is less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The related-use rule is not a problem for gifts of art to a museum with similar works in its collection, but it affects other types of gifts to institutions that plan to convert them to cash. Some clients are surprised to find themselves constrained by this rule when they donate items to be auctioned at the annual church or school bazaar, said Laura Peebles, a director with Deloitte &amp; Touche in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gifts of real estate are not subject to the related-use rule. One of the more unusual ones was a tandem crypt donated to the University of California at Los Angeles. Situated at Westwood Memorial Park, a cemetery where many Hollywood stars are buried, the crypt was near Marilyn Monroe's grave, said Judith Pillon, director of the office of gift planning at U.C.L.A. The university sold it to someone in the entertainment industry for $100,000, Ms. Pillon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many ways to contribute real estate and reap large tax benefits, but these donations carry complications of their own, said David T. Leibell, a lawyer with Wiggin and Dana in Stamford, Conn. Most charities prefer that the property not be mortgaged because it can run afoul of various tax law restrictions. Moreover, the nonprofit, as if it were buying the property, must check for liens and be sure there are no environmental hazards that would require cleanup obligations under federal law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charities are not bashful about looking a gift horse in the mouth. Jane Wilton, the general counsel of the New York Community Trust, said that one time the group declined a gift of a Brooklyn gas station because it was concerned about environmental hazards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnes of Global Special Risks contacted six organizations last spring before he found one willing to accept the closely held business interests he wanted to donate. Ultimately, he funneled them through the Dechomai Foundation, a Marietta, Ga., donor-advised fund that accepts noncash assets, sells them, and within 30 days pays the proceeds (minus a 1 to 3 percent handling fee) to another charity that the donor has recommended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, too, there's a potential tax trap. When a donor has a binding obligation to sell any noncash asset, including real estate, before giving it to charity, the prearranged-sale rule forces the donor to pay tax on the gain, effectively negating any deduction, said Lawrence P. Katzenstein, a lawyer with Thompson Coburn in St. Louis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a donation doesn't cash out promptly, however, both the donor and the charity can be frustrated. That's what happened with some choice Atlanta real estate meant to benefit the Salvation Army. A donor put four acres of undeveloped land worth $12 million into a charitable remainder trust in 2001, expecting it to sell quickly, said Lindsay Lapole, planned-giving director in the charity's Atlanta office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six years later, it's still on the market. Those most immediately affected are the donor and his wife, who were supposed to receive income from the trust, once the property sold, for the rest of their lives; the charity would get whatever was left. Neither donor nor charity has seen a penny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHART: Creative Giving: There are several ways to make a charitable donation of real estate in return for a tax break. The real estate may be a house, apartment, timeshare, land or the like.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALTHOUGH there are many questions about the direction of the Manhattan real estate market, the evidence to date shows that the market remained strong last month, continuing right through the last closings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of sales in October was well above the number recorded during the corresponding month a year earlier although a bit behind the huge volume of sales recorded over the summer, according to a tabulation of co-op and condominium transactions that were filed with the city through the first seven days of November. The number of sales of trophy properties costing more than $4 million increased sevenfold from October 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices also remained high, close to the record prices recorded over the summer, and well above the level in October 2006, when the market was in deep doldrums, and there were worries that the market had begun to turn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices were 16 percent higher last month than a year earlier, and average prices were 45 percent higher than during that slow October a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of unsold co-ops and condos were up from the summer but remained low in October, 22 percent below the inventory reported a year earlier, according to figures provided by Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and an executive vice president and the director of research at Radar Logic.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, city records show that 53 properties closed for more than $4 million in October, including a five-story 7,000-square-foot landmark town house bought by Martin Scorsese on East 64th Street on Oct. 10 for $12.5 million. Last October, there were seven closings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there was the full-floor three-bedroom apartment, with two terraces, bought for $8.2 million on Oct. 19 by Douglas R. Lebda, the founder of LendingTree, the mortgage broker and referral company, in the Legacy, a six-apartment condominium carved out of a former garage at 157 East 84th Street.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lebda is now the president of  <span class="companylink">IAC/InterActiveCorp</span>, the Internet conglomerate put together by Barry Diller, which acquired Lending Tree in 2003. Property records do not list any mortgages on his new apartment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider, too, the $33.4 million sale at 834 Fifth Avenue on Oct. 30 by Loida N. Lewis, the widow of Reginald F. Lewis, the founder of the  <span class="companylink">Beatrice Foods</span> chain. It was sold to Dr. Mark Rachesky, the founder of a fund that invests in distressed properties, and the former chief investment adviser to the financier Carl C. Icahn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To pessimists, the high prices this summer and fall may be remembered as the peak of the New York real estate market, as the impact of the national housing malaise, job cuts and falling bonuses on Wall Street work their way through the Manhattan market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marcia Van Wagner, an economist and deputy city comptroller, said that while economists can forecast trends, they have trouble predicting just when a ''turning point'' will appear. Nevertheless, she said that her agency was updating its economic forecasts as concerns mount, and that she was expecting a slowdown in the real estate market, perhaps later this year or next year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is another view: As long as Manhattan remains one of the world's great cultural and financial playgrounds, the real estate market can continue to rise. While much of the country has been worrying about foreclosures on subprime mortgages, researchers the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University found last month that only a tiny fraction of Manhattan apartments, eight-tenths of 1 percent, were bought with subprime loans last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, two researchers at the consulting firm Business360, John Marchant and Roger Sharp, analyzed long-term trends in Manhattan real estate prices and despite the national credit crisis that emerged over the summer, they predicted that Manhattan prices would continue to rise 5 percent a year for the next three years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pair cited figures showing an expanding base of wealth in New York City: the wealthiest 20 percent of Manhattan residents -- the ones who can afford to buy high-end apartments at current prices -- have a median income of $350,000, or 50 times the income of the bottom 20 percent. And they concluded that home prices are still catching up from the steep declines in the 1990s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Wednesday, the developers of the new 58-story W New York-Downtown Hotel and Residences on Washington Street found that Manhattan market was alive and well. Michael Shvo, whose firm Shvo Marketing is selling the properties, invited 3,000 people who had expressed interest to show up on the opening day of the sales office for the sale of 159 one- and two-bedroom condos. (Another 64 furnished hotel-style condos will go on sale later).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 7 a.m., when the office opened, there was a line on the street, Mr. Shvo said. By the time the office closed at 11 p.m., two hours later than planned, he said, contracts for 72 apartments had been signed. Prices began at $2,000 a square foot, he said, or more than $1 million for a one-bedroom.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in parts of New Jersey hit hard by the subprime mortgage lending crisis have fallen significantly, The Star-Ledger of Newark reported yesterday. The number of home sales in those areas dropped 34 percent during the first six months of the year as compared with the same period last year, the newspaper reported. Home sales dropped 59 percent in East Orange, 41 percent in Elizabeth and 37 percent in Newark. The newspaper based its analysis on home sales figures that were reported to the state.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THINGS are always sweeter at the shore -- even in real estate, as indicated by brokers and by fresh data on the market in several beach towns.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asbury Park, Belmar, Long Branch and Atlantic City, year-to-date figures show residential sales prices were up, even as home values dipped sharply around the state.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three Monmouth County towns -- Asbury, Belmar and Long Branch -- outperformed their county, which showed no increase in median sales price over the first nine months of the year compared with the same period in 2006, according to a market analysis done by the Otteau Valuation Group at the request of The New York Times.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asbury, where a major redevelopment project is in midswing, the median increased by 9 percent this year, to $248,950. In Long Branch, where a transformational redevelopment effort is much further along, the median was up 6 percent, to $402,500. In Belmar, where reconstruction of the downtown commercial area has just begun, the median spiked upward by 23 percent, to $456,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory Demaras, a broker with the John C. Conover agency, the largest real estate office in Asbury Park, said home shoppers continue to ''stream in,'' even though the beach season is officially over. ''The number of sales we had was up 16 percent in Asbury Park this year in the period up to Labor Day,'' Mr. Demaras said, ''and so far, the fall open houses we hold every weekend are very well attended.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a community on the comeback, Asbury Park offers an unusual array of housing types in a wide range of prices. Older bungalows and duplexes away from the water are available in the low $200,000s; condos on the upper floors of the Esperanza, now rising on the beachfront, have asking prices exceeding $1 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One- and two-bedroom condos being offered in a restored former commercial building at 700 Mattison Avenue in downtown Asbury are starting at $389,000. The building offers ocean views from its rooftop deck, as well as private on-site storage and a walk to the train.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Belmar, the median sales price wasn't the only number that rose: there was a sharp increase in the length of time that houses sat on the market. According to the Otteau figures, houses took an average of 138 days to sell -- 41 percent longer than the 98 days of a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In both Belmar and Atlantic City, which is in Atlantic County, median prices may have been skewed upward by an increase in more expensive houses, noted Jeffrey G. Otteau, who heads the property valuation company that analyzed the shore market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Belmar, he noted, used to primarily be a rental community, until the housing boom of the early 2000s. Atlantic City, which until recently had mostly modest housing, and a $210,000 median sales price to match, now has several high-end condominium developments opening, and more in the pipeline.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Explaining why the Monmouth seaside towns outperformed their county, while Atlantic and Ocean County towns did not, Mr. Otteau said, ''Monmouth County is the most accessible shore area to the northern part of the state, and also Manhattan,'' with commuter train and high-speed ferry service from many shore towns.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monmouth County is wealthier than Ocean and Atlantic Counties, according to his statistics. The average family household income (for families with two or more resident members) is $93,028 in Monmouth, $68,422 in Ocean and $63,001 in Atlantic.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are certain Ocean County communities, however, that rank among the wealthiest in New Jersey. Brokers in affluent towns like Point Pleasant and Bay Head say that even if shore area house values aren't appreciating at the rate they did a few years ago, they are not exactly swooning either.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard E. Donnelly, who heads a shoreline real estate company bearing his name, said he brokered the sale of a house on Osborne Avenue in Bay Head last year for $1.8 million, and sold it again last month for $1.875 million. Earlier this year, he sold a house fronting on Barnegat Bay, with only a half acre of property, for more than $4 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His agency recently began marketing a house on the bay with four bedrooms, three and a half baths, a dock and a boat lift, for $4.25 million. Within the first week, two clients were interested enough to return for a second look.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Gail Sempier of Re/Max by the Sea said prices had declined in Point Pleasant. The median price is down 2 percent from last year, according to the Otteau report. But Ms. Sempier is marketing a three-bedroom, two-bath house with ocean views for $875,000 that she would have priced at $1 million or more two years ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a great time for buyers to come down and enjoy the fall colors -- and also the bargains,'' she said.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Oct. 20 -- Despite a record number of foreclosures and a raft of public auctions of unwanted houses, the upper tier of the real estate market in Florida remains relatively immune to the spreading disaster.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses and condominiums with price tags of $1 million or more are still changing hands robustly in some of the most exclusive areas, though at a pace less brisk than a year ago. The glistening waterfront glass towers on Miami Beach, the sprawling estates set in manicured gardens in Palm Beach and the clustered mansions in Naples are attracting buyers, both domestic and foreign.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in other once-booming regions, in Florida the housing market seems to be not one market, but two. The lower end is littered with vacant houses and unfinished developments, and homeowners are struggling to meet their monthly payments as rates adjust upward. The luxury end has its unsold new condos and mansions lingering on the market, too, but as in New York, where the demand in pricey Manhattan is still strong, sales have fallen less. And Miami and other parts of Florida are continuing to attract interest among the wealthy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both markets have been buoyed by foreign buyers attracted to the United States because the weak dollar makes American homes comparative bargains. Florida has the added demand from affluent retirees across the country and second-home buyers, particularly from the Northeast.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The very, very high end of the markets in communities such as the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Manhattan and Miami and to a lesser degree Chicago, Seattle and Washington that have global appeal have held up much better than the rest of the housing market,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''A recession would certainly not help the high end, but it would not undermine it. And much of their buying is done with cash and not affected by the global financial turmoil and its impact on the availability of mortgages.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the greater Miami area. Over all, home prices have fallen 7.3 percent from their peak in December 2006, according to the  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index that tracks repeat sales of specific homes. But because of a shift upward in the value of the homes that have traded hands, the median price for condos sold so far this year for over $1 million is holding steady at $1.5 million, according to the Realtor Association of Greater Miami and the Beaches.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for single-family homes sold is even reported to be up slightly, to $1.51 million from $1.46 million in the 2006 period. In Miami Beach, two brokers, Kevin Tomlinson and Dora Puig, recently represented a buyer from the Midwest who paid $7 million for a beachfront triplex. The sellers, a group of wealthy Mexicans, had bought the apartment for $6.13 million in April 2005, near the height of the market. They put it up for sale in early 2006 for $9.5 million and finally sold it for a 14 percent gain.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When people are realistic about prices, they can sell,'' said Mr. Tomlinson, a broker with EWM Realty, an affiliate of Christie's.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the number of sales, the Florida real estate market as a whole has taken a huge hit this year. Unit sales of homes and condominiums worth less than $1 million in Miami-Dade County, for example, fell 37.2 percent through Oct. 23 compared with the period a year earlier. So far in 2007, 7,078 homes have been sold.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even the high end is cooling off. In the greater Miami area, the number of condos and single-family homes that sold for more than $1 million through Oct. 23 fell 18 percent, to 958 units from 1,166 units in the comparable period a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the very high end of the market in Naples on Florida's west coast, there have been about 40 sales so far this year, compared with 46 sales for all of 2006, according to Thomas L. Campbell Jr., sales associate at Premier Properties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Palm Beach, the number of units sold has fallen 15 percent, to 223 properties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is more inventory in all price ranges,'' said Deborah Boza Valledor, the chief operating officer of the Realtor Association of Greater Miami and the Beaches. But even as more homes linger on the market, some areas remain particularly popular with potential buyers. ''They are waterfront properties that are exclusive,'' she said, ''and people are willing to pay the price.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, more than 78,000 homes were for sale in the Miami area in August, up from 51,000 a year before, according to ZipRealty, the real estate brokerage firm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overhang of unsold homes helps explain why reported selling prices do not tell the whole story. Sellers ''are making concessions,'' Ms. Boza Valledor said. ''They will offer a year's worth of paid maintenance fees to the buyer, or they will pay for the parking space or they will throw in country club fees that might be part of the expense of buying a home in a gated community.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a year ago, when buyers were bidding against one another for properties, such deals would have been unusual. And in another sign that the feeding frenzy has ended, the highest price paid for a Miami-area condo this year was $13.9 million, down from the top price of $16.9 million last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tomlinson, the Christie's broker, suggests that sellers are starting to be more realistic. ''They are coming off their 2005 prices and are more in today's market,'' he said. ''Two years ago, if you sold something at $3.5 million, the next listing in that building came at $4.2 million. Now it is more reasonable.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the state through the end of September, the real estate company Coldwell Banker has sold 1,222 condos worth a million dollars or more, said Clark W. Toole, who runs the company's operations in Florida. The average sale price is down less than half a percent from last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the degree that the market has held up, it has been helped by eager foreigners, checkbooks in hand, who are still showing up and often paying cash. A survey last year by the National Association of Realtors found that the number of foreign buyers in Florida had dropped significantly from 2005. But of those who bought, 29 percent paid cash. Only 8 percent of domestic purchasers did. More than 10 percent of the foreigners bought homes for over $1 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pattern of sales remains uneven, with evidence that some of the most exclusive places are having a harder time. On Fisher Island, the private island just off Miami Beach that has its own golf course, tennis courts and spa, business has slowed sharply, said Lars Ekdahl, who has worked as a real estate agent on the island for 13 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, the island, which boasts Andre Agassi as a frequent visitor and where Oprah Winfrey once owned a home, has 96 of its 700 housing units for sale. At one point, the number offered was just 39.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't think it would affect us so much at Fisher Island,'' Mr. Ekdahl said, ''with the dollar so weak and the euro so strong.'' Only about half the island's residents are Americans. The cost of living on the island has risen because of dues and other expenses, and in a market in which buyers have more choice, they may be pickier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the starkest sign of a two-tier housing market is in Palm Beach. The island of Palm Beach itself has about 8,000 housing units. Leslie Evans, a local real estate lawyer, said that about 80 percent of sales there are cash deals and that most buyers are American. But just across the bridge in West Palm Beach, ''there are buildings with 200 units and 80 of them are for sale, and others where the building is nearing completion and sales will never close.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every time economists and Wall Street executives think they have acknowledged the full extent of the losses from the meltdown in real estate mortgages, more bad news turns up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> said yesterday that it would take a charge for mortgage-related securities on its books that is $3 billion more than the $5 billion it expected just two weeks ago. And a report from the National Association of Realtors showed that sales of existing homes in September fell twice as much as economists had expected, to their lowest level in nearly 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks fell sharply early yesterday on the news, with the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index falling 1.8 percent before recovering in the afternoon. Investors also bid up Treasuries as they sought the safety of government-backed debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this juncture, economists say the troubles in the mortgage market could, all told, cost financial firms and investors up to $400 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is far more than the roughly $240 billion cost, adjusted for inflation, of the savings and loan crisis of the early 1990s, according to estimates of the combined financial toll of that crisis on both the federal government and private sector. The loss in total real estate wealth is expected to range from $2 trillion to $4 trillion, depending on how far home prices fall, according to several economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be significantly less than the losses suffered by investors in the stock market collapse earlier this decade, which erased more than $7 trillion, or about 40 percent, of market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts caution that these estimates are preliminary and the total costs could get bigger still. They also note that the loss of real estate wealth could prove more damaging for the general public than falling stock values because more American families own homes than own stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, the rise in real estate values has helped propel consumer spending, as homeowners refinanced mortgages and took out home equity loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There weren't a lot of people living off their capital gains from stocks,'' said Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management. ''There were a lot people using their home as a piggy bank.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, many people who bought their houses several years ago are still ahead financially, because the sharp run-up in home values is still far greater than the expected decline. Those who bought close to the peak stand to lose the most if they have to sell in the near future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a new report to be issued today, the Joint Economic Committee of Congress predicts about two million foreclosures by the end of next year on homes purchased with subprime mortgages. That estimate is far higher than the Bush administration's prediction in September of 500,000 foreclosures, which in itself would be a tidal wave compared with recent years. Congressional aides provided details of the report yesterday to The New York Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Joint Economic Committee estimates that the lost of real estate wealth just from foreclosures on subprime loans will be about $71 billion. An additional $32 billion would be lost because foreclosed homes tend to drive down the prices of other houses in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those figures would cause a decline of $917 million in lost property tax revenue to state and local governments, which will also have to spend more on policing neighborhoods with vacant homes. The states most likely to be hard hit fall into two categories: those where prices had been rising fastest, like California and Florida, and Midwest states with weak economies, like Michigan and Ohio, where people with low or moderate incomes made heavy use of subprime loans to become homeowners and consolidate debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''State by state, the economic costs from the subprime debacle are shockingly high,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. ''From New York to California, we are headed for billions in lost wealth, property values and tax revenues.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, subprime mortgages make up a relatively small share of the total housing market -- about $1 trillion of the $10 trillion in outstanding mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The much bigger losses will be in declining real estate prices. Household real estate currently totals about $21 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global Insight, a research firm, predicts that the national average for housing prices will drop 5 percent over the next year and 10 percent before mid-2009, for a total of about $2 trillion. Economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> have predicted prices will drop by 15 percent, meaning an overall decline of more than $3 trillion; other forecasters have said the decline could be 20 percent or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices decline slowly, because many potential sellers simply stay in their current homes when they think prices are too low. But that becomes more difficult as people have to move either because of job changes or, increasingly, because their monthly payments are rising sharply. In the next 18 months, interest rates on more than two million homes loans will reset to higher adjustable rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of unsold existing homes rose last month to their highest level in almost 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists continue to update their predictions on how the loss of housing wealth might affect the overall economy. Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at Global Insight, said he assumes that consumers reduce their spending by about 6 cents for every dollar of lost wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If prices drop 5 percent next year, that would mean a decline of $60 billion in spending, all else being equal. That would be a noticeable slowdown, but not enough to cause a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last several years, Americans have increased spending faster than their incomes by borrowing against the rising value of their homes. Economists estimate that such mortgage-equity withdrawals may have added one-quarter of a percentage point to consumer spending growth -- a boost that could now disappear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus far, spending has climbed more than 3 percent over the last year, and the most recent data on chain-store sales suggests sluggish growth but nothing near levels consistent with a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing bust has also led to job losses. From the start of 2003 to March 2006, housing-related businesses like mortgage companies, home builders and contractors added 1.3 million jobs, or about 23 percent of all new jobs created in that period, according to an analysis by Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the housing business has shed 383,000 jobs, while the rest of the economy has added nearly three million jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, said the small decline in housing employment thus far is surprising and suggests more layoffs are ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You still have a million jobs that aren't really needed anymore due to the downturn in housing,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D. Ritch Workman, president of the Florida Mortgage Brokers Association, believes he has an explanation. Many of the brokers and loan officers he knows are still working in the industry, even though they have taken on second jobs to make ends meet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-loan company he owns with his brother in Melbourne, Fla., has seen revenue fall by half, to $500,000, and he has laid off two of its three salaried employees. But the firm has added several loan officers, who are paid on commission only, and it now has 18 people making loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am surprised they have hung in there,'' Mr. Workman said. ''But it's a scary thing when that's all you know. If for 15 years you have been a relatively successful broker and you have lived through the highs and lows, what are you going to do? Most of them are holding on for dear life and hoping things get better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wall Street, which fueled the housing boom by lending to mortgage companies and packaging and selling home loans, banks are writing off billions of dollars in bad loans and are setting aside billions more for the expected surge in defaults. Late yesterday afternoon, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> said it would lay off 3,000 people across the company and has replaced the head of its investment banking division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GRAPH: ''Worse Than Expected'' Third-quarter earnings growth for the financial sector is turning out to be sharply lower than what analysts expected it to be throughout the year. <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> were the largest contributors to the estimated earnings decline since the credit market downturn.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANY people look toward retirement as a chance to make major changes in their activities and their holdings to line up with their quest for fulfillment and financial security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some aim to build a legacy or turn a hobby into a part-time business. But before making any move, experts say, it's a good idea to make sure the tax laws work in your favor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GIFTS AND LEGACIES Tax professionals often advise rich clients to make gifts to children, grandchildren and other loved ones. That's because an individual may make annual gifts up to $12,000 each to any number of people with no tax liability, while estates of $2 million and more are taxable at rates up to 45 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Say a couple has 10 grandchildren. They could give each one $24,000 a year, and over 10 years move $2.4 million out of their taxable estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What about people in their 50s or 60s with assets of only a few million (much of it tied up in their homes), who often fear they may need the money themselves if they live long lives? Charles Massimo, president of CJM Fiscal Management in Garden City, N.Y., has an answer. Put money in a Section 529 college savings plan for the grandchildren. That money qualifies for the annual gift exclusion, and there maybe an upfront state tax benefit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a lot of flexibility,'' Mr. Massimo said. ''No one has to know, not even the beneficiary,'' and, if necessary, the donor can reclaim the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the money goes toward qualified education expenses, any interest, dividends and capital gains will be tax-free. If the donor reclaims the money, any earnings will be taxable and subject to a 10 percent tax penalty, but the donor will have benefited from years of tax-deferred growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Say an affluent 60-year-old is planning to retire in two years and would like to make a gift of money to a new grandchild but is not certain she can afford it. Here's the solution: Put money into a 529 plan, and in 17 or 18 years, when the grandchild is ready for college, the 60-year-old will have a much clearer picture of her own health and finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, Mr. Massimo said, irrevocable trusts, the traditional means of benefiting children or grandchildren, lack flexibility, are liable for income taxes on earnings and have high administrative costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RENTAL REAL ESTATE Some retirees would like to both bring in extra income and create a legacy by investing in rental property. Prospective landlords should not only ensure due diligence on investment properties, experts say, but also bone up on the complex tax laws relating to real estate (spelled out in I.R.S. publication 527).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An ideal example might be to move $500,000 from bonds paying 5 percent interest ($25,000 a year, taxable as ordinary income) into a four-unit apartment house. Say each unit rents for $1,200 a month. After property taxes and expenses of $30,000, that means an income of $27,600, which straight-line depreciation reduces to a taxable $9,418. And the hope is that the property will actually appreciate, leaving an asset for the owner's heirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking care of the property, of course, and attracting and dealing with tenants requires much more work than owning bonds. ''It is an inherently subjective decision,'' said Julian Block, a tax lawyer and author in Larchmont, N.Y. ''Not everyone wants to be a landlord. Some people thrive. Are you handy at doing repairs and maintenance?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If so, he said, read up on tax-code qualifications for being a real estate professional and consider taking a community college course on real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And pray that real estate values do not go down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FROM HOBBY TO BUSINESS Retirees often need extra income. But few succeed in making the leap from gifted amateur to paid professional.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's say that friends praise the pictures you took at their son's bar mitzvah, and you would like to earn money from a hobby. Two words of caution from Barbara Weltman, a lawyer in Millwood, N.Y., who specializes in small-business tax issues. The business world is highly competitive, and you cannot be casual about your work or marketing it. Second, she said, in case you are hoping to deduct your expenses from your taxable income, keep in mind that the I.R.S. disallows what it calls hobby losses, incurred when money spent on the hobby exceeds the income produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you can demonstrate a serious business intent -- have a business plan, keep good books and records, have a separate bank account and charge cards for the business -- you may be able to take a loss,'' she said, and that can reduce your overall tax bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Weltman said that more realistic ways for retirees to earn money are to teach adult-education classes or find part- or full-time work in the nonprofit sector. The pay will probably be low, but the experience may be worthwhile.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Median Rises, but Sales Fall   </span>
</div><div class="author">By VALERIE COTSALAS   </div><div>999 words</div><div>14 October 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the Southampton village of Sagaponack, the median home price has risen a staggering 44 percent since last year, to $5.5 million. Yet as of the end of August, the number of homes sold had dropped by more than half, to 21.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a telling example of what is happening across the East End: a meteoric rise in sale prices that many brokers say is driven by big Hamptons trophy-home sales, but a glut of homes valued under $10 million sitting on the market, including some new ones built by speculators. The numbers were recently published by Suffolk Research Services, a firm that tracks East End real estate transactions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the town of Southampton, which in addition to Sagaponack encompasses wealthy areas like Bridgehampton and Southampton village, the median price rose 21 percent, to $995,000. The number of homes sold, however, dipped 36 percent, to 944. Farther east, in the town of East Hampton, the median price has risen 20 percent so far this year, to $1.1 million, but home sales are down 28 percent, to 467.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the nearly 30 homes sold for $10 million or more this year, Suffolk Research reports, most are in Southampton; three there sold for more than $30 million. Three other sales, ranging from $10 million to $18 million, occurred in Sagaponack.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sagaponack has experienced an ''extraordinary appreciation, even in just the last two years,'' said Judi Desiderio, a real estate broker and an owner of Town and Country Real Estate in East Hampton village. ''It's the same in Southampton village near the beach,'' she added. ''But clear across Southampton and East Hampton towns, the general trend is less sales.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That can make for lower prices in some places, as sellers slowly stop ''reaching for what was,'' as Ms. Desiderio put it, and realize that buyers have lots of inventory to peruse. ''A buyer today comes out and looks at dozens of properties,'' she said. ''They'll know instantly if a house is priced at last year's or today's prices.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Areas where the zoning ordinances allow smaller, half-acre, lots, like Noyac, Springs and Hampton Bays, have traditionally had less expensive prices, she added. More generally, when homes are priced ''below $1 million anywhere, that represents a discount already and you can probably negotiate beyond that.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Brennan, a broker who manages the Southampton offices of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said $5 million was the cutoff below which ''every town has bargains now.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">E-mail messages are regularly flying out to East End brokers, announcing new pricing. ''I see it every day on the computer,'' Mr. Brennan said. ''More and more houses that come from brokers saying, 'Price reduction, price reduction, price reduction.' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the west, the trend is somewhat different: a decline in both the median price and the number of sales. In Westhampton Beach, for example, the median price fell 7 percent, to $601,700, and unit sales decreased by 50 percent, to 51, Suffolk Research Service reports. But those areas don't typically have the trophy-home sales that have propped up easterly prices, according to Lawrence Porter, a broker with Brown Harris Stevens's Westhampton Beach office.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There and in neighboring Quogue, Mr. Porter said, ''volume is way off.'' But he added that demand for properties near the water was still healthy. According to county records, for example, 3.5 acres on Dune Road in Quogue sold for $15.75 million in May.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps inevitably, fallout from the weakening market is starting to affect speculative builders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Speculative financing is the riskiest type of lending out there,'' said David De Vito, a senior vice president who oversees both commercial and residential lending at Suffolk County National Bank, based in Riverhead.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for financing to build have declined by 10 to 20 percent, Mr. De Vito estimated, ''as builders try to sell existing inventory.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UP on the North Fork, where prices are less shocking in general, the median in the town of Southold rose by a modest 5.5 percent, to $527,500. The number of sales, meanwhile, dropped 32 percent, to 275, according to Suffolk Research Service; brokers report high inventories.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though transaction amounts are more limited, however, trends are similar to those on the South Fork: higher medians, fewer sales.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes valued under $1 million, and not on the water or near a creek or bay, are the ones lingering the longest, according to Enzo Morabito, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tighter lending restrictions are also taking a toll, he added, further limiting the number of buyers. ''It's much tougher than it was'' to get a mortgage, Mr. Morabito said. ''Everything's putting a clamp on the inventory; it's sitting there much longer.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a similarly modest pattern in Montauk, on the very end of the South Fork, where the median price has risen 5 percent, to $860,000, and unit sales are down 32 percent, to 67.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent high-end sales in oceanfront areas like the Montauk moorlands have ''pushed up the ceiling'' on prices, said Krae Van Sickle of Corcoran's Montauk office. But lower-end asking prices have risen to a point beyond what the market will bear. ''You can get more land and more house in Springs now for $600,000 than you can in Montauk,'' he said. He expects prices to flatten in the lower and middle range, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a little quiet,'' Mr. Van Sickle said of the pace of sales. ''I think people are taking a wait-and-see approach and being a bit more cautious.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It puts you in a trance, and you don't really want to leave,'' said Matthew Markunas, who lives in Northumberland, Pa., and owns a lakeside cottage with his wife, Kimberly, not far from the village of Watkins Glen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Markunases have three young daughters, and they tend to spend every other weekend at their cottage during the spring, summer and fall because there are plenty of things to do that don't require a video monitor. ''There's an unlimited amount of skipping stones up there,'' Mr. Markunas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He adds that the Watkins Glen region is appealing because it is not as crowded, or as expensive, as similar getaways in the Poconos that are closer to the family's home in central Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watkins Glen, the seat of Schuyler County and about 250 miles from Manhattan, has become more popular as a second-home destination in the last 10 years because of the growing number of wineries that ring Seneca Lake, said Kathy Romanos, who owns Cabins to Castles on Seneca Real Estate in the heart of this charming village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, Watkins Glen, which is also the location of a Nascar stock car race every August at a racetrack outside the village, has begun to thrive. Storefronts are filled, the marina has been revitalized and hotels and condominiums are on the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Ms. Romanos opened shop in 1996, the average sale price of a house has more than doubled, from $66,000 to $145,000, and more visitors tend to wander into her office to see what is for sale. ''They have just fallen in love with the serenity here,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Scene</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Franklin Street is the main north-south artery. An eclectic mix of coffee shops, restaurants, clothiers, bookstores and car dealerships nestle next to busy sidewalks. The Schuyler County Iron &amp; Agricultural Works, near the waterfront, is now occupied by a wine store and a store that sells racing souvenirs and tickets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tree-lined streets with handsome brick houses built in the 1800s spread out from Franklin Street like branches from an oak. Local produce is sold on the sidewalks of Fourth Street. Johnny's Bowling Lanes occupies a spot on Decatur Street, near the lakefront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people like that village lifestyle,'' said Vivian Schamel, known as Vicki, a native of the region who is an agent for Prudential Ambrose &amp; Shoemaker Real Estate in Watkins Glen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State Routes 14 and 414 head north, uphill, from the village along each side of the lake, and wineries extend on both sides. There are 32 wineries on the Seneca Lake Wine Trail, which loops around Geneva, N.Y., at the northern end of the lake, 45 minutes north of Watkins Glen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first draw was the wineries,'' said Mike Coia, a Quakertown, Pa., resident who last year bought a winterized, 50-year-old fishing cottage along the lake with his wife, Linda. ''It's not at all uncommon for us to spend a day going from one winery to another. That's a staple. But relaxing on the deck is good enough, too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wineries aside, there is also an old-fashioned movie theater downtown and plenty of good restaurants like Maria's Tavern, a comfortable pub where wings and burgers hold down the menu. For those who like to spend their weekends outdoors, Watkins Glen State Park is at the southern end of the village and has a trail that climbs up a 400-foot-deep gorge. Hikers use natural stone steps to pass over and under waterfalls. And the 16,000-acre Finger Lakes National Forest is northeast of town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pros</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordable housing and a mild climate are part of the town's allure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Coias paid $210,000 last year for their two-bedroom cottage in Lodi, N.Y., about 20 miles north of Watkins Glen. Mr. Coia, who is starting a renewable-energy business, said the price was right. ''We just couldn't touch anything in Pennsylvania at anywhere near what we could afford,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Finger Lakes can be cold in winter, but Mr. Coia said the region is not as frigid as other parts of New York State, so they can use the house for at least six months a year. ''We call ourselves a little Florida,'' said Judy Phillips, the village's mayor. ''It's really nice here during the winter -- it really is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cons</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem with such a pleasant place is that traffic inches through town during the busiest summer weekends. The toughest weekend to get around is when the stock cars race at nearby Watkins Glen International.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Real Estate Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Schamel, who has been an agent in town for 24 years, said she had her best year in sales last year, which topped her previous best, in 2005, which topped her previous best, in 2004, and so on. Because of increased sales and fairly small inventory, competition for properties has intensified, Ms. Romanos said. ''The bidding wars have been kind of fun,'' she said, smiling. ''We're not used to them here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents say properties for sale disappear quickly, and that any open land that is ideal for a small winery usually sells even faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't see a lot of condominium or town-house developments, but they're coming,'' Ms. Schamel said. Ground is to be broken this fall on a 29-condominium development called Seneca Harbor Place, with units selling for $285,000 to $425,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Older homes in the village have become popular, particularly among those who fancy themselves as fixer-upper-tacklers. Ms. Romanos laughed when she said she can tell if a prospective buyer has been watching home-improvement shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the available properties are two-bedroom lakeside cottages that local residents used just for fishing in summer. Ms. Romanos had such a cottage for sale for $175,000. The cottage would have sold for about half that much five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who have bought second homes here recently believe they have made a good buy. The Markunases paid $250,000 in April 2006 for a refurbished two-bedroom cottage near Chateau LaFayette Reneau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marty and Karen Breinlinger, who have two children, paid $273,000 for a two-bedroom lakefront cottage in Hector, north of Watkins Glen. The original structure was built in the 1930s and renovated in the 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Breinlingers live in Elmira, N.Y., about 25 miles south of Watkins Glen, and are at their second home almost every summer weekend. They had rented houses at the lake for years, but it made sense to them to buy a place when the right one came along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are places along Seneca Lake where there are multimillion-dollar homes,'' said Mr. Breinlinger, a freelance artist, ''but affordability had a big factor to do with getting this place -- being able to swing it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAY OF THE LAND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">POPULATION 2,099, according to a 2006 Census Bureau estimate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article and a subheading on Tuesday about the strength of the New York real estate market in the third quarter of this year referred incompletely to the share of the market made up of co-op apartments. Co-ops make up about 70 percent of the ''for sale'' market, not the total housing market. (Rental apartments represent 76 percent of the New York City market; the remainder is apartments ''for sale.'')   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sat Oct 06 2007    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declining prices, rising inventory and increasing foreclosure rates may have hobbled many of the nation's housing markets, but they have not yet reached Manhattan and brownstone Brooklyn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The people who closed on co-ops, condominiums and town houses there paid more than ever, on average, for real estate in the third quarter of this year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four reports issued yesterday by the city's major residential real estate brokerage firms showed that apartments closing in Manhattan in July, August and September sold for the highest average sale price ever and that the inventory of homes for sale declined over all.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, buyers spent $1.37 million for a Manhattan apartment, a 6.3 percent increase from the corresponding period last year, according to one report, by Prudential Douglas Elliman. The number of apartments on the market fell by nearly a third, to 5,204, in the last quarter, compared with 7,623 a year earlier, the report said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These numbers indicate that the real estate market was even stronger in the summer, traditionally a slower season for real estate, than it was in the spring, when prices rose in some segments of the market -- like new condominiums and the largest apartments -- but not all.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two brokerage firms -- Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property -- said in their reports that prices had risen for nearly every type of apartment in almost every neighborhood of Manhattan, from bare-bones studios in the borough's northernmost reaches to luxurious four-bedroom apartments on the Upper East Side. Prices in Brooklyn, which had dipped in the second quarter, rose by 11 percent last quarter for apartments and town houses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is one of the best quarters that we've ever had,'' said Pamela Liebman, president of  <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, which also released a report yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But brokers and the economists who prepared the reports stressed that the numbers mainly reflected buyers who went to contract for apartments weeks before the national credit crisis hit and before many people grew more cautious about buying. For instance, many of the co-ops that closed in the last quarter actually went into contract during the spring, and many buyers of newly built condos put down payments on their apartments months, even years, before their units were finished this summer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, executive vice president and director of research for Radar Logic Inc., which tracked the numbers for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that any qualms buyers might have had because of the credit crisis this summer would not have shown up in the third-quarter data.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing is a trailing indicator of economic conditions,'' Mr. Miller said. ''We most likely won't see a reaction until after the new year to the credit crunch.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But buyers in neighborhoods in some parts of Brooklyn and Queens have already been hit. The number of foreclosure auctions jumped by 64 percent last quarter, to 698, compared with the same period last year, out of some three million households in New York City, according to PropertyShark.com.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These foreclosures are concentrated in a few neighborhoods, notably Jamaica and Howard Beach in Queens and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, brokers said that prices in Manhattan have held up far better than in the rest of the country because co-ops, which make up roughly 70 percent of the city's housing stock, have rules that can prevent buyers from using the riskier mortgages that were prevalent elsewhere in the country.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More than any other market in the country, there is tremendous equity in our homes,'' said Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens. ''It's a strong, solid market with a lot of equity, not a lot of inventory and strong demand.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales prices for Manhattan co-ops lagged far behind condos in the second quarter, as is typical, they rose in the third quarter because there were far fewer co-ops to choose from as inventory declined, said Dottie Herman, president of Prudential Douglas Elliman.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're not building co-ops anymore,'' she said. ''So there's a finite number.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest gains in prices in Manhattan were for three- and four-bedroom apartments and the most expensive apartments on the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Upper East Side, apartments with four bedrooms or more cost an average of $6.6 million -- 17 percent more than a year ago, according to data released by Brown Harris Stevens. On the Upper West Side, apartments with three or more bedrooms cost an average of $4.5 million, a 46 percent jump from last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for the most expensive Manhattan apartments -- the top 10 percent of sales -- were the second highest on record. The average sale price for a luxury apartment was $5 million, behind only the second quarter of 2005, when it was $5.2 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn, the number of sales rose. Buyers in Brooklyn closed on 311 condos and 173 co-ops last quarter, compared with 210 condos and 167 co-ops a year earlier, according to data tracked by  <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Brooklyn is finally starting to reap the rewards of all the new construction,'' said Ms. Liebman,  <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> president.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of sales of single-family houses and town houses in Brooklyn rose by 63 percent from the previous year. That might have been partly because prices in the borough are much more attractive than in Manhattan: The average single-family home in Brooklyn sold for $1.6 million, compared with $5.8 million in downtown Manhattan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared the market studies for Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, said that New Yorkers will not know where the market is headed until the effects of the credit crisis are clear: Jobs may be lost on Wall Street and bonuses may shrink.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the rest of the country, housing markets are doing poorly because there's too much inventory, people are having a hard time getting mortgages and local economies are beginning to slow -- none of which has happened here yet,'' Mr. Heym said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For New York to see a downturn, he added, ''something more dramatic is going to have to happen.''   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the heat of August, the American home market wilted.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports this week showed weak sales of both new and existing homes during the month, and the first two large home builders to report summer profits called the market dismal.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The economy got to the point where pricing was just unrealistic and maybe even ridiculous,'' said Stuart Miller, the chief executive of the  <span class="companylink">Lennar Corporation.</span> ''August really seemed to be a melting pot of all things negative.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story was similar at  <span class="companylink">KB Home.</span> ''The oversupply of unsold new and resale homes and downward pressure on new-home values has worsened in many of our markets,'' said Jeffrey Mezger, the chief executive.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the market declined throughout the summer, but ''the deterioration accelerated dramatically in the month of August.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those two companies are the only major builders with quarters ending in August, and between them operate in most of the major markets, including California, Florida, Illinois, Texas and New York.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is an unusual time where almost every market across the country is similarly impaired,'' Mr. Miller said. Some were hurt less than others, he said, ''but all of the markets are down.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some markets, he said, the company cannot sell homes for more than they would cost to build, even if the land were free.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As one of the accompanying charts shows, Lennar's rate of both new orders and deliveries -- final sales -- were down more than 40 percent from the previous year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With sales of both new and existing homes down, more homes are now on the market than ever before -- almost 4.5 million, a figure that is nearly double the number in early 2005, when prices were rising and home builders were reporting high profits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And many of those homes have been on the market for a while. Of the 178,000 completed new homes that were available for sale at the end of July, fewer than 15 percent found buyers in August. That was the lowest rate in more than a decade.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2006, it appeared that the housing market had stabilized after falling, with new homes selling at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about one million, and investors bid up the price of home builder stocks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with all the bad news, those prices have fallen to new lows. The pace of new-home sales in August was just 795,000, a seven-year low.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are falling in most markets, according to the S.&amp;P./Case-Shiller index of home prices, and in July -- the figures reported this week -- they were down 4.5 percent, year-over-year, for a 10-city composite.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Futures are traded on that index, and while volume is very low and thus perhaps of little forecasting value, the futures prices indicate that home values are expected to keep falling until 2010.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest reason for the August plunge appears to have been the chaos in the mortgage market, where a number of lenders have gone out of business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many buyers with good credit can still get mortgages, but their purchases often depend on selling their old homes, something that is getting much harder as other would-be buyers find they cannot get financing, or cannot sell their old homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As 2006 ended, economists generally thought the economy had weathered the housing decline with little effect on consumers. Now many are not so sure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The talk at Friday night dinner parties is going to be how little the house down the road sold for,'' said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. And that, he said, is likely to restrain spending as homeowners feel less wealthy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHARTS: Housing Picture Worsens, Again: Hopes for a rapid revival in the United States housing market were hurt this week by reports of declining sales of both new and existing homes in August. The first major home builder to report profits called the month ''a melting pot of all things negative.'' Share prices of home builders fell, as did an index of home prices. The futures market thinks home prices will not hit bottom until 2010.; S.&amp;P.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales slumped again last month and one of the nation's largest home builders reported its worst quarterly earnings ever yesterday as fallout from the mortgage crisis continued to cause havoc in the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of previously owned homes in August dropped 4.3 percent from July, sending sales to a five-year low, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday. The annual sales rate fell to 5.50 million from 5.75 million in July, the steepest percentage decline since March. Existing-home sales are down nearly 13 percent over the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also yesterday, the home builder Lennar reported the largest quarterly loss in its history after the company was forced to write down $848 million in the value of real estate. It reported a net third-quarter loss of $513.9 million, or $3.25 a share, in contrast to a profit of $206.7 million, or $1.30 a share, in the period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar reported a 44 percent drop in revenue in its third quarter, to $2.34 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Lennar fell almost 4 percent yesterday, to $23.22, down 96 cents. The company's stock stood at twice that value just four months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad news in the housing sector was coupled with a discouraging report on consumer confidence from the Conference Board, whose index tumbled to 99.8 in September from 105.6 in August, a steeper drop than forecast. The index is now at its lowest level in nearly two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just a very negative environment here for residential real estate, which obviously feeds back into consumer attitudes and consumer spending,'' said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR, a New York research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A weak job market and stagnant wage growth have caused anxiety among consumers, analysts said, suggesting potential declines in consumer spending and job creation over the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or, as one market watcher put it: trouble ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm normally bullish on the U.S. economy; there's no bullish data here,'' said Joseph Brusuelas, the chief United States economist for IdeaGlobal. ''It is what it is. It's quite dark, and it's going to take a bit longer for the market to reach its bottom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brusuelas said he expected to see significant price adjustments in the housing sector. ''Individuals are going to have to withdraw homes for the moment, and long-term rates are going to have to come down until we have anything resembling any rational semblance of equilibrium in the market,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar has reduced its work force by 35 percent, making the company another victim of the high inventory levels and credit market turmoil that have buffeted home builders this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its chief executive, Stuart A. Miller, said in a statement yesterday that there was ''continued deterioration of our net margin and accordingly, higher impairments to our inventory.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said further job cuts were in store for the fourth quarter, though he promised a return to profitability after market conditions stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More grim housing news came from the S.&amp;P./Case-Shiller index, which tracks home prices in 20 American metropolitan areas. That index dipped 0.4 percent in July from June, with prices now off by nearly 4 percent over the last 12 months. Prices in the New York City housing market dropped 1 percent in July compared with those in June and are down 3.8 percent over the last year, according to the index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of consumers who plan to buy automobiles or homes in the next six months dropped from July, the Conference Board said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the median sale price for homes fell to $224,500, down more than $4,000 from July, though that figure is slightly up from last August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of unsold homes rose 0.4 percent in August, to 4.58 million, a 10-month supply at the current sales rate. That compared with a 9.5-month supply in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the gloomy numbers, at least one real estate leader said he remained optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most people buy products when the prices are low,'' said Tom Kunz, president of Century 21, in a telephone interview yesterday. He added that consumers should not be scared off by the troubles in the subprime market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reality is,'' Mr. Kunz said, ''if I have a job, and I have income, and I have a good credit rating, I can buy a house today.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID LEONHARDT   </div><div>1010 words</div><div>19 September 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve sent the stock market soaring yesterday. So can it stop the decline in home prices, too?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't count on it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the late 1960s until 2000, the price of the typical American home and the income of the typical family moved almost in lock step. House prices rose a bit more quickly than incomes during the occasional real estate boom, but would always settle down again. In 2000, the median home cost about $130,000, roughly three times the typical household income -- almost precisely the ratio that had held since the '60s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came a real estate boom unlike any before it. By last year, this ratio of prices to incomes had suddenly shot up to 4.5. For it to return to its old level, home prices would have to fall by an almost unthinkable one-third, and probably more in California, Florida and the Northeast.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are good reasons to believe that the real estate slump won't be quite that severe -- more on that shortly -- but there is also reason to think the slump still has a long way to go. That's why the Fed went further than most Wall Street analysts expected yesterday, cutting interest rates by half a percentage point and announcing, in effect, that it is now on a recession watch.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And whether home prices begin falling noticeably or merely stagnate for years until incomes catch up, it's clear that the real estate bust has become the dominant force in the economy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, Robert J. Barbera, who's been a Wall Street economist for 25 years, was predicting a soft landing for housing -- that is, stagnation rather than substantial declines. So were most forecasters. ''But now it appears that's not the way we're going to do it,'' says Mr. Barbera, the chief economist at ITG Hoenig, who correctly predicted yesterday's Fed move.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has changed in recent weeks are the spike in mortgage rates, the drying up of subprime lending and the ever-growing number of houses on the market. A research firm called RealtyTrac reported yesterday that mortgage lenders had filed 244,000 foreclosure notices last month, up from only 113,000 a year earlier. Amazingly, more than a third of the filings were in just two states, California and Florida, the sites of some of the largest prices increases and the most ridiculous mortgage lending.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also worth looking at what happened to home sales last month in California, where counties release property transaction records earlier than they do in most of the rest of the country. With mortgages harder to come by, home sales dropped even more rapidly than they had earlier in the year. In the Los Angeles area, 35 percent fewer homes sold this August than in August 2006, according to an analysis by  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems. Around San Francisco, the decline was 31 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exact path that housing prices will take over the next few years is, obviously, unknowable. But there is a good deal of evidence to suggest that the typical home last year was overvalued by something like 20 percent. I wouldn't necessarily argue with anyone who insisted on 15 or 25 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason it may not be bigger is that mortgage rates remain a good bit lower than they were for much of the last generation. But they're not so different as to suggest that home prices have returned to rational levels. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody'sEconomy.com, ran an analysis for me this week in which he looked at home values, mortgage rates, tax rates and incomes going back to 1968. Taking all these into account, he found prices were about 20 percent too high.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interestingly enough, Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor, made a presentation at the Fed's annual Jackson Hole conference last month where he sketched out the effects of a hypothetical housing downturn in coming years. The price decline he chose was 20 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scariest part of a national decline like this is that it could be more like 40 percent in some parts of the country. That's difficult to fathom -- and, in fact, construction would probably come to a halt in those places, cushioning the price drop locally and, by extension, a bit nationally. But 40 percent is not out of the question in a few places, like the southwestern coast of Florida.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember that all of these declines are relative to income or inflation. The median house price nationwide has already started falling since last year, according to the S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller Index, the most accurate measure. If actual prices were to fall 10 percent over the next year or so and then do nothing for following five years, that would add up to about a 20 percent decline, adjusted for inflation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would be a big deal. It would lead to lost jobs, less consumer spending and slower economic growth. It would be the worst housing downturn on record.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard not to notice that the latest round of grim news has come in the same week that Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke's predecessor at the Fed, is making the rounds of talk shows to promote his new memoir. Mr. Greenspan has long defended his inaction during the housing boom, particularly his decision not to crack down on out-of-control mortgage lending, by saying that bubbles are extremely difficult to recognize until after the fact.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't know, though. This one didn't seem so subtle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Bernanke has to deal with its aftermath. So do the rest of us.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEWARK, Sept. 17 -- The home builder  <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises</span> claimed ''huge success'' on Monday with its weekend sales blitz, which included six-figure discounts on homes being built or completed in 19 states.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said it made more than 2,100 sales, broken down as about 1,700 contracts signed and 400 deposits taken. It said agents took deposits when they did not have time to finish the paperwork for contracts before the deadline of 9 p.m. Sunday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales promotion began at 9 a.m. Friday at 449 communities nationwide. Prices were lowered by up to 25 percent, with the largest discounts typically offered on the most expensive homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discounts included a three-bedroom condominium by the Hudson River in West New York, which was reduced by $240,000, or 22 percent, to $862,000. A 25 percent discount was being offered on a two-bedroom home in Jackson Township, N.J., lowering its price tag to $300,501.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preliminary results exceeded expectations, said Ara K. Hovnanian, the company's president and chief executive.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The high level of traffic we saw in our sales offices and models over the weekend and over the past several weeks convinces us that there are interested buyers in the market today,'' Mr. Hovnanian said. ''However, with all of the negative publicity about the housing market, many home buyers were hesitant to buy because they worried that even lower prices might be offered later.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other builders, Hovnanian, based in Red Bank, N.J., has been hurt by sharply reduced sales and growing inventories.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weekend's figures approached Hovnanian's results for the most recent quarter. It reported 2,539 contracts for the three months that ended July 31, down 24.2 percent from the period a year ago. Hovnanian sold 3,179 completed homes in the quarter, down 31.2 percent from a year earlier.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A slow-motion crisis in housing is consuming a region strangely unable to confront it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing advocates in these suburbs have long seen it coming. They have fought to build affordable-housing developments, and have been mightily opposed by residents blind to the benefits and overwrought by its perceived problems: density, traffic, higher taxes and those people -- blacks, Latinos and the working class -- although few these days are candid about that last part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some affordable housing has been built -- a 12-family complex was dedicated just last week in Bridgehampton, of all places -- but not nearly enough to make a difference. Meanwhile, steadily rising housing prices and rents are making living here increasingly untenable for anyone of modest means, including young couples, students, entry-level employees, retirees, police officers, teachers. These are just the sort of people who make a community vibrant and healthy and save it from gated stagnation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordable housing is also critical for the region's economic viability. It will be increasingly difficult to attract businesses if families cannot afford to buy homes. A Census Bureau report released last week showed that housing costs are eating up an ever-larger share of people's incomes, a fact that residents of Long Island know only too well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to recognizing the scale and urgency of the housing shortage, some leaders are farther along than others. They include Long Island's county executives -- Thomas Suozzi, who has housing development in his grand vision for the economic rejuvenation of Nassau, and Steve Levy, who wants to tackle the problem on a big scale in Suffolk, with a plan for 1,000 units on county-owned land in Yaphank, where large corporate employers are being encouraged to relocate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Levy is leading an effort of seven downstate counties -- Suffolk, Nassau, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Dutchess and Putnam -- to press for help from Albany to confront what they consider a regional emergency. The legislation they envision would enlist the state's help in planning projects and identifying potential housing sites, making loans for infrastructure improvements, recommending housing goals and providing land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initiative is a good and promising example of the broad, regional thinking that will be needed to solve this crisis. The problem, though, is that the effort is entirely voluntary. Since state and county governments do not control zoning, the most they can do is entice and cajole towns and villages into doing the right thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordable-housing advocates have long urged a tougher approach. They have sought a state law on inclusionary zoning, which would mandate that a percentage of new housing units be set aside as affordable. The State Legislature, however, has never gone along, which is unfortunate. Inclusionary zoning legislation is still one of the best hopes for solving the housing shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until then, it is up to downstate suburban leaders like Mr. Levy, Mr. Suozzi and Andrew Spano in Westchester to make the case -- in unison -- for a solution to the problem. One well-meaning package of voluntary measures out of Albany is not going to get the region beyond its housing shortage. But it is a start. The first step to overcoming a problem is recognizing that you have one.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR more than a year, home buyers who have been looking in the suburbs of Manhattan have struggled to reconcile market rhetoric with metro-area reality. Technically, the overstocked and sluggish market gave them the upper hand. But when it came to actual negotiations, sellers were clinging tightly to the past, and many scoffed at price reductions of more than a few percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, after a nearly nonexistent spring selling season and a summer marred by stock-market jitters, buyers and sellers are closer to a meeting of the minds. Real estate agents and market watchers throughout the region report that houses are selling at prices 5 to 18 percent lower than a year ago. When a property draws multiple bids these days, agents say, it's usually because it's in fantastic condition and priced for the current market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Homes that have come on the market in the last two or three months have started at prices that are more conservative,'' said Savo Fries, manager of the Houlihan Lawrence offices in Yorktown and Croton-on-Hudson, both in Westchester County. ''Sellers are finally more willing to listen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in the most exclusive enclaves, like Greenwich, Conn., where the median sale price has remained relatively flat this year at around $2 million, sellers impatient with the market are entertaining lower offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is an awful lot on the market that is languishing, particularly in the $1.5-million-to-$3.2-million range,'' said Nancy Healy, a partner in Shore and Country Properties. ''You're not going to get a huge discount, but for properties that have been sitting, they will at least listen to you now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bargain hunters are likely to find sellers far more receptive elsewhere in the metropolitan area -- but not everywhere. Prices in some towns are falling more steeply than in others. While it's difficult to generalize across such a broad market, one overriding factor appears to be driving the differences: the proximity to Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey G. Otteau, president of the Otteau Appraisal Group in East Brunswick, N.J., picked out the pattern while analyzing the unsold housing inventory in towns on and around the commuter rail lines into New Jersey. Communities directly on the rail lines and fairly close to the city, like Maplewood, Montclair and Chatham, tend to have less than six months' worth of inventory, a level more characteristic of a rising market than a falling one. Some towns still on rail lines but farther out have slightly higher levels, and those off the rail lines altogether, including Caldwell, Belleville and Harding, more consistently show 6 to 12 months of inventory, an indicator of a downward market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau surmises that metro-area suburbs are reverting to their pre-1980 dependence upon Manhattan for high-paying jobs. Since 2000, he noted, rising housing costs in the suburbs coupled with the slow rate of job growth outside the city, particularly in high-salaried occupations, have contributed significantly to a trend: more residents who are United States citizens left New York, New Jersey and Connecticut than moved in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey from 2000 to 2006, for example, the number leaving the state exceeded the number who moved in by nearly 278,000, according to census data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the Manhattan economy remains strong and its roaring housing market has yet to slow, housing demand is being driven outward along the rail lines. The towns least accessible to the city, however, are more vulnerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've returned to a market where Manhattan is once again king,'' Mr. Otteau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau has not analyzed inventory levels across the region, but interviews with real estate agents and appraisers suggest the same pattern fits. There are exceptions, of course. Proximity to Manhattan cannot compensate for the socioeconomic challenges facing Newark, for example; it shows a housing inventory of 16 months. And towns an hour or more from Manhattan but close to smaller employment centers, like Stamford or White Plains, are less affected by their distance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Basking Ridge, N.J., in Somerset County. Although it's a 90-minute rail commute from Manhattan on <span class="companylink">New Jersey Transit</span>'s Gladstone branch, Basking Ridge shows just four months of housing inventory, most likely because of the concentration of high-paying employers close by. Its housing market is currently oversupplied with four-bedroom colonials in the $600,000-to-$1-million range, but newly built houses costing more than $1.2 million are still selling quite well, said Michael Lattmann, a sales associate with Burgdorff ERA Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Properties that have held their value have made updates,'' like renovations or new appliances, Mr. Lattmann said. ''Others are down anywhere from 8 to 15 percent -- effectively, you're paying for that update.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Town-by-town differences aren't evident in the countywide data gathered by multiple listing services. Agents interviewed made their own calculations for individual towns based on the most current multiple listing data available and on their personal experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, housing prices in areas at the outer edges of commuter territory, and especially off a rail line, appear to be under considerable downward pressure, particularly at the upper end of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southbury, Conn., about 80 miles from Manhattan just off Interstate 84, had about 150 houses on the market earlier this month, about a year's supply, according to David Nyman, an associate broker with Century 21 Home Services. At least 25 of those listings were priced above $850,000, far more than the market could absorb in a good year, never mind a year in which the market for New Yorkers buying second homes ''has totally dried up,'' Mr. Nyman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just below Southbury, in northern Fairfield County, Newtown's inventory ''just keeps climbing and climbing,'' said Valda Thompson, sales manager for the local William Raveis office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Checking the number of listings earlier this month, Ms. Thompson let out a squawk. ''Holy cow!'' she exclaimed. ''There are 327 homes on the market, not including condominiums, which is absolutely incredible. We're back in a market like the '80s, where it did take six months to sell a house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slower market worked to the benefit of Elise Sher, who recently closed on a newly built 5,800-square-foot home in a new subdivision in Southbury. The price -- just over $1 million -- wasn't such a great deal compared with prices in Houston, where Ms. Sher and her family had lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she acknowledged that the builder gave her and her husband a host of add-ons, including a $20,000 appliance package and a larger patio, without increasing the price. ''Basically, everything I asked for I got,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar houses in the area were priced at $1.2 million to $1.3 million, ''but the builders were just holding out,'' she said. ''Our builder told me he would not have worked with a buyer like this a year ago. He said he had sold a similar house close to a year ago for $150,000 more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, builders in Orange County, N.Y., which has seen a wave of new construction over the last few years, are adjusting their designs downward to put them in lower price ranges. The houses at Oxford Landing, a luxury development in Blooming Grove, in southeast Orange, were originally going to start in the $800,000 range, but the builder has added a slightly smaller model with less expensive exterior finishes that will sell for $600,000 to $700,000, said Matthew Rand, managing partner for the Rockland and Orange County operations at Prudential Rand Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Fairways, a gated development of town houses and single-family homes priced from $380,000 to $750,000 in Wallkill, the developer, Martin Ginsburg, has put off opening the project's second phase because of the slow market, but he hasn't lowered prices yet. ''The very fact that our pricing is comparable to what it was a year ago is an incentive,'' he said. ''Our costs have gone up, even though our prices haven't. Our margins are disappearing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Valure, the owner and principal broker at Viking Realty in Middletown, said that so much new construction in Orange County is languishing that ''builders left and right are flipping the lots now, just selling off the lots, where a year and a half ago, you never saw that.'' More than 700 lots were for sale earlier this month, though not all have been approved for building, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Putnam County, the median sale price of a single-family home dropped 9 percent, to $398,500, during the second quarter of this year compared with the same period last year, according to the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although that figure overstates price declines in the Brewster and Carmel market, said Donald A. Mituzas, the Brewster office manager for Prudential Serls Prime Properties, market pressures are evident in the appearance of short sales -- sales of distressed properties in which the lender agrees to accept less than the amount owed. He said he had recently shown four or five such properties in a single weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ellen and Joseph Mazzei negotiated what they felt was a very good deal on a house in Carmel that was in foreclosure. They spent months looking at houses in nearby Mahopac last year, only to become frustrated with sellers' unwillingness to negotiate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had sold their house in Carmel relatively quickly by lowering the price early on, but in Mahopac, prices still seemed ''too high for the condition of the homes,'' Ms. Mazzei said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raeann Mazzei, Mr. Mazzei's aunt who is an associate broker with Houlihan Lawrence, helped them find the house they bought from the bank that owned it. It's a contemporary, built in 1989; it has a new kitchen, but other improvement projects, like the master bath renovation, were left unfinished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house was listed at $525,900. The Mazzeis offered $475,000 and eventually agreed to pay $485,000, an amount that would have bought only what they considered junk in Mahopac, Ms. Mazzei said. They closed in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Yorktown Heights, situated between the Hudson and Harlem Lines of the <span class="companylink">Metro-North Railroad</span> in northern Westchester, sale prices are down about 12 percent from the height of the market, agents said. The oversupply is highest at the upper end -- above $600,000 -- where there is less demand. Those homeowners ''have competition not only in their own town, but the surrounding towns,'' said Robert Mulvey, vice president for sales at Century 21 Mulvey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In pricier Chappaqua, on the Harlem Line about 10 miles to the south, a decline in the median sale price of about 6 percent in the last year has opened up an ''under $1 million'' category. ''We have 18 properties on the market between $800,000 and $900,000'' said Sena Baron, an associate broker in Houlihan Lawrence's Chappaqua office. ''Two years ago, we had six. It's a new price range.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, the median sale price on single-family homes in Manhasset, on the North Shore in Nassau County, is also down about 6 percent, according to Judi Lovecchio, branch manager of Coach Realtors' Manhasset office. The fairly stable market there has benefited substantially from its proximity to Manhattan -- it's the second Nassau County stop on the Port Washington branch. ''The train line makes a big difference,'' Ms. Lovecchio said. ''You're there in 26 minutes, and there's a million of 'em every day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farther out along the high-priced North Shore, prices are coming down more sharply. Figures supplied by Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, the Manhattan appraisal company, showed declines in median sale prices of 10 to 18 percent in many North Shore localities during the first half of the year compared with the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the shift there appears to be less tied to commuting times. Joyce Styne, an executive vice president at Century 21 Laffey Associates, said prices were dropping sharply on some shoreline properties, the reason being that they rose so quickly during the housing boom. The market was still so hot in the East Hills and Roslyn area in August 2006 that it took just under 60 days to sell a house. This August, Ms. Styne said, the average number of days on the market was closer to 190.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The North Shore was similarly affected in the late 1980s and early 1990s after the downturn in the defense industry, said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, an influential business group. At that time, she said, prices at the higher end, ''where there's more room to adjust,'' dropped by some 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roberta Feuerstein, a sales associate with Shawn Elliott, said that in the Dix Hills and Melville area in Suffolk County, just over the Nassau border, prices have come down about 10 percent. Some homeowners are having to reduce their prices by much more, she said, but those houses are usually the ones that were most grossly overpriced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all sellers have come around to the new reality. ''We have homes overpriced by $300,000 or $400,000 out of just pure insistence,'' she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the News Half of the nation's renters and about a third of mortgage holders spent at least 30 percent of their gross income on housing, the Census Bureau found, an increase of about 1.5 million households compared with 2005. The data suggests that incomes did not keep up with rising housing prices as lenders let home buyers borrow more relative to their earnings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEWARK, Sept. 13 --  <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc.</span>, struggling like other home builders, is offering six-figure discounts on some of its properties this weekend as it tries to draw interest in a slumping market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales blitz involves dropping prices by more than 20 percent on some of its prime real estate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discounted properties include a three-bedroom condominium by the Hudson River in West New York, which has been reduced $240,000, or 22 percent, to $862,000 this weekend. A 25 percent discount is being offered on a two-bedroom home in Jackson Township, N.J., which lowers its price tag to $300,501.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian is making the discounts during the worst housing downturn in 16 years, which has sharply cut earnings for the company and other national home builders. Tight credit, fueled by a meltdown in the subprime mortgage industry this year, has sidelined potential buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week Hovnanian, based in Red Bank, N.J., reported its fourth consecutive quarterly loss.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This weekend's sales, announced Sept. 5, involve thousands of homes in 19 states.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No other major builder is having a sale of such magnitude, but swollen inventories are likely to lead to more discounting, said Sam Chandan, chief economist at  <span class="companylink">Reis Inc.</span>, a real estate research company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The downward adjustment in prices, whether for new homes or existing homes, is going to be far more severe than what many people thought earlier this year,'' Mr. Chandan said.   </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Housing Costs Consumed More of Paycheck in 2006   </span>
</div><div class="author">By JOHN LELAND   </div><div>1065 words</div><div>12 September 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing costs ate up more of the monthly paycheck for millions of Americans in 2006 than the year before, despite signs of a slowdown in the housing market, according to figures made public today by the Census Bureau. The bureau also reported that more Americans over age 65 were continuing to work last year, whether by choice or out of economic necessity.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing data describe the buildup of economic pressures before the recent wave of foreclosures, as lenders allowed home-buyers to borrow more money relative to their earnings and consumers borrowed or refinanced as if the market would never fall. At the same time, incomes did not keep up with housing prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, half of renters and more than one third of mortgage holders -- 37 percent, up from 35 percent in 2005, or a rise of more than 1.5 million households -- spent at least 30 percent of their gross income on housing costs, the level many government agencies consider the limit of affordability.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe it all means that housing is not as smart an investment for as many people as we thought,'' said Matt Fellowes, a scholar in metropolitan policy at the Brookings Institution. ''Stocks perform better than houses over time. Maybe the American dream should be building wealth in general, not building a certain type of wealth, which we see is narrow and dangerous.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fourteen percent of mortgage-holders spent at least half their income on housing in 2006, up from 13 percent last year, while among renters there was little change. In both years, 25 percent of renters spent half their income on housing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising housing burden cuts into the money people have available for other expenses and anticipated the rise in foreclosures.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not an accident that the states that are leading in foreclosures, including California, Nevada and Florida, are also on top of the list for the proportion of mortgage borrowers paying more than 30 percent of their income on housing,'' Mr. Fellowes said. ''Take away the four top states, and there's actually a decrease in foreclosures.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, where the median home price rose to $536,000 (compared with a national median of $185,000), more than half of all homeowners with mortgages and renters lived in housing not considered affordable. Twenty-two percent of California homeowners and 27 percent of renters spent more than half their income on housing last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These consumers are extremely vulnerable to any change in their income or expenses, including increases in their adjustable mortgage rates, said Eric S. Belsky, executive director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard. The states with the highest shares of mortgage-holders paying at least 30 percent of their incomes for housing -- California (52 percent), Nevada (46 percent), Hawaii (46 percent), New Jersey (45 percent) and Florida (45 percent) -- include the leaders in housing foreclosures.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The lure was that housing prices would always increase,'' so people with adjustable rate mortgages could refinance before the higher rates kicked in, Dr. Belsky said. Lenders approved mortgages based on borrowers' abilities to pay at the low initial rate, not the potential higher one, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But the more you initially stretched, the more painful any increase becomes, and the less recourse you have to make up the money, because there are only so many places to stretch the budget.'' As interest rates rose and housing prices softened, many people now owe more money on their houses than the houses are worth, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question now, he added, was whether the recent rise in interest rates would push more people into the rental market, and so drive up rents. ''It's too early to tell,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing statistics come from a wide-ranging annual study called the American Community Survey, which the Census Bureau released in two parts. The first part last month revealed modest gains in median household income last year and a rise in the number of uninsured. The data were analyzed for The New York Times by Andrew A. Beveridge, a demographer at Queens College.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing values and rents both rose in 2006. The median gross rent inched up to $763 per month, from $751, and the median home value rose to $185,000 from $173,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cheapest rents were in Dona Ana County, N. M. ($401) and Belmont County, Ohio, ($417), while the highest median home values were all in Southern California: Santa Barbara, Santa Monica and Newport Beach, each slightly over $1,000,000. The combined five boroughs of New York City were far down the list, at $496,000, but New York County -- that is, Manhattan -- finished fourth among counties, with median home values of $788,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new data also show changes in the composition of households. Homeownership continued to rise, while the percentage of households that could be described as nuclear families -- two parents with children under 18 -- continued its decline, to 22 percent last year, from 24 percent in 2000. More families spoke a language other than English in their homes in 2006, when compared with the previous year, most often Spanish.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in older workers reflects a combination of factors, said Yung-Ping Chen, a professor of gerontology at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. Nearly one quarter of Americans from 65 to 74 -- 23 percent -- were either working or looking for work, up from 19.6 percent in 2000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the poverty rate for this age group has declined, dropping below that for people age 18 to 64, many still fear that they will run out of money, especially as companies have eliminated traditional pension plans, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are living longer, and they need more resources,'' Dr. Chen said. ''There's a great fear of income inadequacy. At the same time, I don't see a lot of people in the need category having the option to work longer. It's a typical social issue embedded in economic realities -- those who need it the most are not able to prolong their work life. It's not just bricklayers or long-haul truck drivers. Even nurses -- it's hard work.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Peter Toner, an agent at  <span class="companylink">Prudential California Realty</span> in La Jolla, Calif., arrived in San Diego from England 10 years ago to practice real estate, he realized the city had a market quirk unlike any he had encountered. There were properties listed with a price range as opposed to a set price. Rather than being listed at $550,000, say, a house might be put on the market for $510,000 to $565,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Variable pricing, also known as ''value-range marketing'' or ''range pricing,'' has gained popularity in the San Diego area over the last decade, becoming an established peculiarity of the region's real estate market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes marketed with a range in San Diego County has steadily grown since it was introduced in 1995. There were only 12 value-range sales in 1996. Today range-priced listings make up 50 percent of all sales in San Diego County, with 15,335 properties sold with range pricing last year out of a total of 30,831 sales, according to Ray Ewing, the president and chief executive of Sandicor, a regional multiple listing service.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Range pricing has been used in other areas of the country, like New York, Arizona, Michigan and Florida, but in no other place has it become as widespread as in San Diego. Brokers, though, have differing opinions about whether the strategy works best in a flourishing or declining market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The system was introduced by  <span class="companylink">Prudential California Realty.</span> In a lagging market many people initially had positive experiences with the system, according to Mr. Ewing of Sandicor. It has become pervasive, he said, because the variety of property types in Southern California makes pinpointing comparable prices a challenge.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You may have an established neighborhood, but you may have a new house'' on the market, Mr. Ewing said. ''How do you value that?'' He pointed out that in subdivisions inland, where views and coastline do not affect property values, finding comparable properties and setting a fixed price is much easier than in areas along the coast.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, value-range pricing has thrived in San Diego because the multiple listings service adjusted its database to accommodate homes listed in price ranges; other listing services post homes only at a fixed price.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brokerage adapted the strategy from an Australian sales model where it had been popular in the 1990s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We started range pricing in a market very similar to this,'' said Carlton Lund, a broker with  <span class="companylink">Prudential California Realty</span>, referring to today's downturn. ''It was through necessity that we used this concept because the market was arduous and there was not a lot of activity.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest advantage of using value-range pricing in this market is ''giving people the opportunity to think they have the chance to negotiate,'' said Sharyn Crown, a broker at Napolitano GMAC Real Estate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A property is listed with a nod to a buyer's preferred price -- that is, the lower end of the range -- and at the higher end of the range is the seller's ideal price, Mr. Lund said. The range tells buyers that sellers will entertain offers between those numbers, and if a bid is made within the range, the negotiation process may begin.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people who come in are saying, 'Why on Earth would I offer any more than the bottom end of the range?' '' Mr. Toner said. ''But if the range is somewhat correct, that's where the offers start.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Diego's volatile housing market today, there are more home sellers than buyers, and mortgage lenders are skittish about lending, brokers say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victoria Crown, a broker who is Mrs. Crown's partner and daughter, said that when the market was rising, agents used value-range pricing more than they do now. ''I think that is part of the reason the market moved up here, personally,'' she said. ''On the flip side, as the market is moving down, some agents use it as a crutch because they don't really know where the price is.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept has come of age with online search engines, like realtor.com, featuring ranges in their listings, allowing a property to come up in more searches. Others pull in only the higher number and list a property at that price.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having been tested in a seller's market in 2003 to 2005, when bids tended to come in from the middle to the top of the range, and in the current buyer's market, when offers lean toward the bottom end, Mr. Lund has seen how price ranging can work in both circumstances. ''I tell sellers that a low offer is better than no offer,'' Mr. Lund said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are times when agents shy away from this strategy. Mrs. Crown prefers a fixed price when she is confident about pricing the property because of a recent comparable sale. Mr. Toner said that if a house is not getting attention when listed at a range, he will switch to a fixed price.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig Burris, an agent with Coldwell Banker, said he would not use it now because buyers are wary about property values, and if there is a hint of a low end they will probably go lower than that.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Value-range pricing ''is effective in getting traffic and exposure,'' Mr. Burris said, ''however, if the goal is getting a price in the middle of those ranges, I don't see it working right now.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rose Jakobczuk-Seda moved to San Diego from Portsmouth, Va., in July when her husband, Gil Seda, a physician in the Navy, was relocated. The couple sold their two-story brick colonial on half an acre in Virginia for $335,000, but Ms. Jakobczuk-Seda said they couldn't find anything comparable for even twice that price in California.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is very bizarre,'' Ms. Jakobczuk-Seda, a clinical psychologist, said of the marketing model that she encountered in San Diego. ''On the East Coast, they just give you a price. I certainly wouldn't want to give away what my lowest possible price would be.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house they ultimately bought was first on the market at a fixed price of $765,000. Stymied in inactivity, it was relisted at a range of $698,500 to $765,000. Still, the couple offered only $650,000 and agreed on $675,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While they plan to enjoy their mountain views and the temperate weather during their three-year stay, they already have an eye on their next move. ''When I sell this house,'' Ms. Jakobczuk-Seda said, ''I'm not going to price it in a range.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a license to carry. It's only for dogs. I've had a couple of bad run-ins with dogs.'' This was Gary Prescott. A few weeks earlier, Prescott and his partners at a firm called Equity Solutions Realty bid on a property just north of St. Petersburg, Fla. The owners, a recently separated couple, were several months late on their mortgage payments. Prescott was hoping to buy it before the foreclosure. So on a broiling-hot afternoon in May, he and I and a woman named Rose, who came to appraise the property for the bank, stood before a two-toned, white and cherry red house with two ratty mattresses leaning against the facade. A dog started barking when Prescott opened the door, and Rose became concerned. ''Are these people O.K. with us coming in?'' Rose asked. ''Yeah, I met the lady this morning,'' Prescott said to her, but then he excused himself. Two minutes later he was back with a black Kel- Tec handgun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prescott keeps his handgun at the ready for precisely this ritual, known to real estate investors as the B.P.O., or broker price opinion, and to the rest of us as an appraisal. The bank relies on the appraiser to evaluate Prescott's offer. Prescott showed up on this day to plead his case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prescott trooped to the rear of the house while Rose, who asked that her last name not be used, waited with me in the foyer. Prescott is a wide-faced man with earnest green eyes and a mild overbite, which, from certain angles, makes him look much younger than his 50 years. He first got into real estate in the 1980s while attending college in Vermont. Lacking money, he used elaborate financing schemes to build a portfolio of some 20 apartments, which he'd rent to fellow students. He carries himself like someone who knows his way around an investment property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's O.K., the dog's in a pen,'' Prescott called out. Rose and I took this as a cue to wade cautiously into the living room. The house looked as if it had been abandoned and resettled by squatters. There were takeout boxes all over the floor, along with empty beer cans and bottles of vodka. The walls were streaked with grime, and the only thing masking the smell of mildew was a terrific pet odor. The house was fairly typical of an impending foreclosure, in other words. People who can't make their mortgage payments don't often make maintenance a high priority. The lawn is usually the first to go; the living space the last. This place had been empty for at least a month and looked to be in the final stages of decay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last few years, Prescott and his partners have done a booming business in a transaction called a short sale. When a homeowner gets behind on his payments, he normally has two alternatives to foreclosure: refinance, or sell the house and pay back the loan. But since the local market collapsed in late 2005, many mortgages have turned ''upside down''-- that is, the owner owes more than the house is currently worth -- eliminating both options. That's where Equity Solutions comes in. Prescott asks the bank to approve the sale of the house at a cut-rate price (hence, ''short sale'') and to forgive the balance of the mortgage, all prior to the actual foreclosure. When executed correctly, a short sale can leave everyone better off: the homeowner walks away with his credit largely intact; the bank salvages part of a nonperforming loan without the headache of repossessing a house; and, of course, Equity Solutions gets the best of the deal -- a property it hopes to flip at a profit. (The firm rehabs some houses before selling them; others it unloads ''as is,'' a practice known as wholesaling.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rose and I both stopped short when we got to the back porch. Prescott had neglected to mention that the dog in question was actually two dogs -- and that both were pit bulls. He seemed untroubled by their presence, however, and promptly got to work. ''There's the roof,'' he said, pointing to an overhang jutting out over the porch. ''It's all warped, corroded.'' Rose nodded without comment. Prescott darted inside: ''I'll show you the baseboards,'' he said. ''You can see the termite damage.'' Another nod. ''Oh, this is worth a picture here. The dry wall is peeling off.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a while, Rose stopped tiptoeing around the house as if it were booby-trapped. She snapped a couple of unsolicited photos and even led the way into a bedroom. When we came out, the door to the adjacent bedroom was shut, and Rose turned the knob to ease it open. Suddenly she darted past me toward the front door, arms flailing over her head cartoon-style. A third pit bull came trotting out behind her and into the yard. The dog was clearly pregnant -- her swollen stomach sagged almost to the floor -- but mercifully she was good-humored. The smell, though, was ferocious. I poked my head into the vacated room and found the floor covered in excrement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She's wagging her tail, she's fine,'' Prescott called soothingly. ''Thank God the dog has a good disposition. A lot of pregnant ones don't.'' He resumed his inventory. ''Have you seen the kitchen? God forbid you have snakes in there -- '' But Rose had had enough. ''This is definitely just a tear-down,'' she sighed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You notice when she came out she was very negative,'' Prescott told me as we drove off. He was pleased that the bank would be receiving a downbeat assessment. ''This one is probably better to wholesale, but it's a good house for us if not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prescott met his partner Jim Izzolo in late 1999. A few years earlier, Prescott moved to Florida as a marketing executive for a portraitstudio chain called Olan Mills. Izzolo, who is about a decade younger than Prescott, was the real estate agent who sold him his first house in the area. The two men hit it off and began working together on the occasional real estate deal. One early investment was a four-family building on the Gulf of Mexico, not far from St. Petersburg. Prescott and Izzolo renovated the place and rented it out at a hefty monthly rate. They bought other beach properties to rehab and resell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One night in 2002, Prescott was at a bar in an oceanside restaurant when he overheard an older man say he'd bought 43 houses all at once. Prescott was intrigued and took the man out to lunch the following day. It turned out his dining companion had purchased the properties through short sales. It was the first time Prescott had heard of anyone buying a house for less than the amount owed on the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Prescott told his partner about the idea, Izzolo was skeptical. ''You can't do it,'' Izzolo said. But both men were curious enough to do a little research. Prescott asked around at his real estate investment club. Sure enough, a few had heard of short-buying, and one investor recommended some self-proclaimed gurus. Before long, Izzolo and Prescott were on a plane to Denver to attend a course taught by two of them -- Dwan Bent- Twyford and Sharon Restrepo. Together, it cost them $4,500 to enroll, plus $3,000 for airfare and hotel. Izzolo paid it grudgingly. ''If this is a bunch of fluff, I'm going to raise hell,'' he told Prescott.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seminar was convincing enough that the two men paid Restrepo $10,000 to help set up their business, then called G. R. Prescott &amp; Associates. The business did well from the start, and earlier this year, Prescott and Izzolo moved into a new office in a small shopping center in Largo, a middle-class St. Petersburg suburb. During the boom, foreclosure was mostly something that affected low-income people. It made sense to be near south St. Petersburg, the city's poorest neighborhood. Since the crash began in late 2005, however, foreclosure problems have worked their way up the socioeconomic ladder. According to the most recent data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the foreclosure rate for prime borrowers, who tend to be middle class, has increased by one-third since bottoming out in early 2006. And Prescott and Izzolo have followed the trends uptown. Prescott says that the potential for a large profit is greater reselling middle-class houses, with mortgages in the $150,000-to-$300,000 range, than for downscale homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, as lucrative as it can be, short-buying more upscale homes can be tricky in a down market. Prescott says the partnership was closing deals on about 50 houses a year at a profit of about $20,000 to $25,000 each at the height of the boom. But last year, the first full year of focusing on more affluent homeowners, was the company's worst ever -- it made only about $10,000 to $15,000 a house on approximately the same number of houses. Reselling the homes has become much more difficult. During the boom, Prescott and Izzolo could buy a house and quickly wholesale it to another investor, who would do the fixing up and either rent it or resell it. But the slumping real estate market has scared off many investors. And while Equity Solutions can always do the rehab and sell the house retail -- that is, to a family that wants to live in it -- a down market tends to make middle-class buyers incredibly choosy. For example, the company recently negotiated the short sale of a house for $199,000, even though the owner still owed $288,000 on the mortgage. But the partners could resell the house for only $230,000. They made a profit of about $21,000 -- less than they expected. This has made it all the more important to procure homes at a substantial discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, the parade of grim statistics on foreclosures -- more of a death march, really -- has become the central story line in this decade's preoccupation with real estate. The Wall Street Journal reported in June that lenders will repossess nearly one million homes through foreclosure both this year and next, almost double the annual number between 2000 and 2006. The problem with so many foreclosures is that they create a vicious cycle. When a bank repossesses a home, it tries to unload it as quickly as possible, for as cheap as necessary. This adds to the inventory of homes available -- in the Tampa Bay area, only about 1 in 15 homes sells each month, versus 1 in 2 at the market peak -- and depresses prices. But when prices drop, foreclosures rise, because financially strapped homeowners can't sell their houses to pay off their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foreclosures are concentrated in the subprime portion of the market -- that is, among people who qualified for mortgages despite the fact that they had poor credit histories. Nationally, 1.3 percent of all homes were in foreclosure as of early 2007, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, but that percentage quadruples for the subprime demographic. Subprime mortgages typically involve adjustable interest rates that escalate quickly, so it's not surprising that foreclosures have increased over the past few years. Since the real estate market peaked in 2005, the subprime foreclosure rate has spiked from 3.3 percent to more than 5 percent. Some of the mortgages, called ''liar loans,'' require almost no documentation of a borrower's ability to pay. The most infamous breed is known among mortgage brokers as the ''Ninja'' loan, short for ''no income, no job or assets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this was made possible by the securitization of residential mortgages, one of the most fateful financial-market innovations of the last generation. Put simply, many lenders no longer hang on to the majority of the loans they make. Instead, they typically sell them to investment banks, which slice them up into securities and offload them to investors. Over the last several years, hedge funds, pension funds and university endowments eagerly snatched up subprime mortgage securities on the assumption that, even if a significant number of homeowners defaulted, the rest were paying such high interest rates that the investment was sound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entirely foreseeable consequence of this was to give rise to what economists call ''moral hazard.'' Because the banks were acting as middlemen rather than holding the mortgages themselves, their incentive to vet borrowers declined strikingly. Mortgage quality declined with it. Over the last few months, as investors have seen the value of their subprime portfolios collapse -- two such funds run by the investment bank <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> disintegrated this summer, for example -- it has become painfully obvious that investors' assumptions about the risks they took on were wildly optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day I was in the Equity Solutions office and Prescott handed me a Washington Post article about <span class="companylink">New Century Financial</span>, one of the more notorious mortgage lenders. The article reported that salesmen in one New Century office had become legendary for strolling past the cubicles of the company's appraisers -- the people charged with rejecting bad applications -- with a baseball bat. One salesman slammed his bat down on an appraiser's desk after she turned down a deal. ''The stress in that place was ungodly,'' the appraiser told The Post. ''There was instant notification to everyone as soon as you rejected a loan. And you dreaded doing it because you paid for it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long before there can be a short sale, even before there can be a broker price opinion, Prescott must locate a distressed homeowner and establish a rapport. Some in the short-sale business use fliers or direct mail for this purpose. Others cold-call. A select few advertise on radio or latenight television. But no one would deny that old-fashioned door-knocking is far and away the most effective way of landing a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today the partners no longer personally do any prospecting. Instead, they employ a team of roughly half a dozen contractors to gin up business. The door-knockers receive a fixed fee of $3,000 for any deal that closes (and a bonus if the house is subsequently resold for a large profit). The more prolific among them can earn $75,000 a year. Four years ago, however, when Prescott and Izzolo were just starting out, it fell to the two men to do the door-knocking themselves. Izzolo was the undisputed champion of this activity, and he still trains the new recruits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Izzolo volunteered to take me through a brief role-playing exercise. He is a small man with short brown hair and droopy eyelids. The day I met him, he was wearing a short-sleeved red shirt and black chinos and sported a week-old goatee. Though he has a half-ironic manner that makes it hard to tell when he's joking, particularly when he slips into over-enunciated real estate speak, his talent for salesmanship is obvious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basic idea, as in all sales efforts, is to leave the prospect simultaneously insecure about his situation and awed by your expertise. To accomplish the former, the door-knocker will systematically demolish any assumptions, most of them admittedly delusional, that allow the homeowner to believe he can resolve his troubles alone. To accomplish the latter, the door-knocker will trot out an intimidating litany of dates and deadlines -- you will get another notice in 30 days, you will have a chance to ask a judge for a 60-day extension -- which the door-knocker can help navigate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Izzolo illustrates one technique based on his own experience. ''You'd knock on a door and say, 'What do you think your house is worth?' They say, 'One-twenty.' You look around and say, 'One-twenty?' '' Izzolo screws up his face for emphasis. ''They say, 'Well, 110.' You say, 'One-ten?' '' Izzolo screws up his face again, but now he sticks out both hands, too. ''They say, 'O.K., 100.' You say, 'Well, you don't have any equity.' They think you're going to walk away. And you say, 'No, there's a way.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Door-knocking has become vastly more efficient in the Internet age. Banks and mortgage lenders must file paperwork with a local court to begin the foreclosure process, at which point the borrower typically has three to six months to settle up or vacate the house. Pre-Internet, anyone prospecting for short sales would have spent hours each week rifling through court documents. In recent years, however, online listing services have proliferated. The service-providers send workers to the courthouse and regularly update their listings. Investors like Prescott pay a monthly fee to access them. The prospectors then fan out across town to make their pitches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One afternoon I went on a door-knock with a prospector named Ray Smith. Smith is in his late 20s, broad-shouldered and blond. He bought a few houses from Prescott and his partners two years ago and came aboard not long after. Smith has recently scaled back his prospecting efforts while he studies to become a licensed appraiser and tends to his own fast-growing stable of rental units. He lives on the northern edge of St. Petersburg's slowly gentrifying ghetto, in strategic proximity to tenants and prospective clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We circled the neighborhood in Smith's beat-up Jeep Cherokee for two hours without making much progress. When we rang the doorbell of a tan stucco house on 20th Avenue, two children pressed their heads against the window, but no one answered. A teenage girl greeted us at an apricotcolored house on 26th Avenue. She told us her mother received a thick package -- the foreclosure notice -- after the landlord stopped paying the mortgage, but she didn't know any more than that. Between houses, Smith shared his philosophy on door-knocking. ''Most people want to talk to you,'' he said. ''It'' -- foreclosure -- ''is a problem. And everyone wants to talk about their problems.'' Later he told me that the trick is to be patient. ''A lot of people think they have more options than they do,'' he said. ''They say they're going to sell it. You call back and say, 'Did you sell it yet?' '' Invariably the answer is no.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The very last address on our list was not far from Smith's place. It was a two-story house with blue-gray siding, set back so far from the road we almost missed it. A makeshift wooden fence blocked our access to the porch, so Smith banged on the side of the building. When no one answered, we tried our luck at the rear of the house. Finally, a gawky man no older than 25 emerged from the porch. He had long brown hair and a prominent Adam's apple and was wearing a gray T-shirt that said, ''Makeup Doesn't Cure Ugly People.'' It looked as if we had woken him up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once Smith introduced himself, the young man seemed either grateful for the interest or too defeated to shoo him away -- it wasn't entirely clear which. Predictably, the man said he was thinking about selling. ''What are you trying to sell it for?'' Smith asked. The young man said, ''Two-fifteen.'' Smith said: ''Two-fifteen? Wow, you really think you can sell it for 215?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After some brief chitchat, the young man invited us in for a tour. He told us he was a landscape foreman who had lost his job. He couldn't suppress his pride when showing off the fans he'd installed and a new second-floor bathroom. Behind almost every door there were more people, three generations in all. A mother in one room, a sister in another. Young children came out of the woodwork, as in one of those cartoons where a house has been sliced down the middle to reveal activity inside every nook and cranny. When the tour ended, Smith asked if there was a place we could sit and talk. The landscaper led us to a small den with a bookshelf full of James Patterson novels and an ashtray overflowing with cigarette butts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landscaper told us his family moved into the house last fall, at which point the landlord suggested they buy it. In December he closed on a mortgage. He told me he thought the payments would be around $1,000 a month, but by February they were nearly double that amount. He lost his job around the same time. With no income and an entire brood to feed -- he and his girlfriend have five children, including 4-month-old twins -- he said he hadn't paid more than $100 in any month since. The foreclosure documents arrived in mid-May, about a week and a half before we did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking very slowly and very calmly, Smith sketched a crude time line on a yellow legal pad with the dates June 17 and July 17 spelled out in block letters. ''You'll get another foreclosure notice here,'' he said, pointing to the second date. He told the landscaper he would have a month to move out at that point, unless he got an extension from a judge. ''We'll go to court with you,'' he added reassuringly. Smith punctuated his sentences by asking, ''Do you see what I'm saying?'' The landscaper nodded vigorously each time, but it wasn't clear that he did. Every few minutes he looked up and said hopefully, ''If you could help us stay in the house, that'd be great,'' even though Smith had suggested nothing of the kind. After Smith explained how a short sale works, he handed the landscaper a document authorizing Prescott to access his records. ''Now let's do the right thing and sign there,'' Smith said. The young man scribbled his signature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the encounter with the landscaper, I stopped by the office to meet with Izzolo and Bill Mirro, a childhood friend of Izzolo's who joined the firm almost three years ago. They immediately concluded that the landscaper's mortgage was dubious. For one thing, the property had been appraised for $215,000. But given the size of the house and its location -- on the northern edge of the poorest part of town -- the price seemed outrageously high. All the more so given that the sale took place in December 2006, a year after the market had turned. Appraisers must justify their estimates with recent sales data for comparable houses in the neighborhood. Mirro speculated that the appraiser had simply gone two blocks north -- across Central Avenue, the boundary between the historically white and black sections of St. Petersburg -- where an identical house sells for $20,000 to $30,000 more. ''If the bank's based in California, they don't know,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landscaper appeared to have what is known as a ''phantom second'' mortgage. Because he lacked money for a down payment and had no hope of qualifying for 100 percent financing on $193,500, which is what the owner appears to have been asking, the inflated appraisal of $215,000 made it look as if he were borrowing only 90 percent of the asking price. It was unlikely that the landscaper even knew about the arrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landscaper never actually owned his house in any meaningful sense. He never could have afforded it in a rational world. ''It was the bank's house,'' Mirro said. ''He was just living in it.'' From the perspective of the lender, he was an easy mark for a mortgage that could quickly be resold on Wall Street, but he had no equity. The real casualties of the boom are people like Shenecial Bailey and her husband, who owned the house with the pregnant pit bull. If not for relentless marketing and the allure of easy money, she would probably be sitting on more than $50,000 in home equity today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple bought their house in 1998 for the modest sum of $53,000. By 2003, the value had climbed to more than $70,000. Soon they were on the receiving end of endless offers to cash out their equity in exchange for a larger loan. They agreed to one in February of that year, then again in December 2005. This put another $45,000 in their pockets. But by the following year, the money was gone and the Baileys were splitting up. The monthly payments were now more than double what they had been under the original mortgage, and far higher than Shenecial Bailey, an assistant manager at a local <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>, could afford. She stopped making payments in August, and the bank sent a foreclosure notice in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late April, Bailey was about to lose not only her home but also her shot at ever getting another one. Prescott hadn't heard from the Baileys' lender for several days, and the auction date was less than a week away. If it were to arrive before Prescott could close the deal, the Baileys would see their credit destroyed and all his work would be for naught. Prescott advised Shenecial Bailey to declare Chapter 13 bankruptcy to stop a potential sale. He had a paralegal prepare the necessary documents and urged Bailey to drive the documents to the courthouse immediately. It was the morning of the auction, and it sometimes takes the court two days to notify a lender of a bankruptcy filing. She and Prescott just had to hope the papers would be processed in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prescott is prone to philosophical musings, which sometimes masquerade as mundane observations. One day, as we were driving back from one of his properties, he explained his approach to his volatile line of work. ''The key to this business is to keep expenses low,'' he told me. ''That's where all these seminars go wrong. They say buy a nice car, buy a nice house. All those people lose.'' He was scowling as he told me this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even now that he has socked away a comfortable nest egg, Prescott still lives modestly. His dream is to buy the lot next door to his house and build a Mediterranean-style palazzo. But he plans to do it in the style of the third world. ''I'll put the facade up, build the whole shell, do the grounds, build the foyer, a bedroom to start off. But then you leave it and do it out of your own pocket.'' It's as though Prescott has seen too much wreckage as an investor to take on even a modest risk in his personal life. In any case, he says he's too cheap to consider it. ''Even at a decent interest rate, if you financed it for 30 years and borrowed $2 million, you'd end up paying $4 million, $4.5 million. That's nuts. Crazy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dealing day in and day out with foreclosure candidates can influence your worldview. Prescott's experiences have made him a bit of a bleeding heart, even if he wouldn't necessarily describe himself that way. ''The socialization process you get in this country is not good,'' he said as we drove farther. ''We're consumers, we're not people. People go through school and it's rote learning. They're not equipped to function in society.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prescott is the first to acknowledge that he's in business to make a buck. But his self-image is deeply tied to the idea that he's helping homeowners. He often gets emotionally involved in their cases. When Izzolo mentioned a client named Harold Craton, 79, who started drowning financially after his furniture-refinishing business failed, Prescott became sober-faced. ''This is a guy you'd really like to see keep the house, but he's so far under the bus.'' Another client was a 21-year-old telemarketer whose uncle had used him as a frontman to secure several mortgages, then had promptly fallen behind on the payments. ''Whoever made those loans ought to be in jail,'' Prescott told me. ''Here's a kid working hard, trying to get out of the inner city, and he's picked up by a crook who happens to be a relative.'' When clients are vacating a house, Equity Solutions will help sell their appliances and any other belongings they might want to liquidate. Recently, Prescott's sisterin- law began posting Craton's antiques for sale on <span class="companylink">eBay</span>. ''We try to get them a little money to start a new life,'' Prescott said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times it can be hard to tell where Prescott's do-gooder instincts leave off and self-interest kicks in. Prescott has told me that if clients ask, he will try to work out a forbearance with the bank -- which is to say, some sort of repayment plan that lets them keep their house. ''I'll do that for nothing,'' he said. ''It's good karma.'' No doubt. On the other hand, the majority of homeowners who win forbearances end up back in foreclosure within a year. When they do, they're likely to call Equity Solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I dropped in on Prescott in late June, he seemed reflective. He'd spent weeks working on a deal for a house owned by the telemarketer with the dodgy uncle. Prescott had finally reached an understanding with the lender and even had a buyer lined up. But at the last minute, the lender informed him that there were actually two mortgages on the house and that the second had been sold to another bank. Prescott would have to open up an entirely separate negotiation to complete the sale. He stared straight ahead and slowly shook his head as he told me this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the recent news on the deal front hadn't been all bad. Shenecial Bailey stopped the auction of her home with a successful bankruptcy filing. In June, her lender allowed the sale of the property to Prescott for $80,000. Bailey promptly went to court and retracted the bankruptcy, a move known as a voluntary dismissal, which preserved her good credit. After the sale -- and a thorough cleaning by Bailey -- Equity Solutions resold the house for $100,000 to an investor the partners had dealt with frequently. Prescott and his partners cleared $11,000. ''It was a small one for us,'' he said. Had the housing market been better, he added, ''we would have made 20.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are no longer shocked when the Dow Jones industrial average plunges 10 percent -- as it did this summer -- or when a single hedge fund, this one run by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, drops 30 percent in a week. But real estate, we thought, was different. Hedge funds execute hundreds of trades a day, often according to the whims of a computer; people buy their homes one at a time and usually retain them for years. But last month's market turmoil revealed a doleful transition for real estate. Formerly the most prosaic and dependable of investments, homes over the last 30 years had been turned into trading chips for Wall Street. And now, even at a time when the economy is still growing apace, two million Americans are suddenly said to be at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure. How did real estate become an industry with the vulnerabilities of esoteric financial instruments?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the golden age of American home buying -- the years after World War II -- savings-and-loan institutions or government agencies supplied returning G.I.'s with fixed 30-year mortgages. Home prices appreciated, steadily but at modest rates, and lending fiascoes were rare. And homeownership rates climbed. The buyers of that era were not necessarily more cautious than today's; they simply spent what their bankers lent them. The bankers, persnickety folks that they were, required that buyers demonstrate sufficient income to qualify for a mortgage. They did this because a) they would get stuck with the property if the buyer defaulted and b) regulators insisted on prudence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world began to change in the late 1970s, when Salomon Brothers, in the person of a banker named Lewis Ranieri, pioneered the mortgage security. This showed a flash of genius. Even though each unit of real estate continued to be a slow-moving, illiquid asset, Ranieri perceived that the underlying mortgages could be traded as rapidly as stocks and bonds. Instead of keeping his mortgages in a drawer, the banker on Main Street could unload his risk by selling them to Salomon. The banker was thus converted from a long-term lender to a mere originator of loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salomon and other institutions would take the mortgages sold by banks and stitch together bonds backed by the payments of many mortgagees, which they sold to investors. Voila! Ranieri had knitted a group of inert mortgages into a tradable security. The mortgage market thus obtained liquidity, which, according to Wall Street, made mortgages cheaper and benefited us all. Once the mortgage originator became, in effect, a supplier to Wall Street, new, often unregulated nonbanking companies jumped into the game of brokering and also issuing mortgages. Over time, this weakened lending standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Robert Rodriguez, a mutual fund manager for First Pacific Advisors (where I own shares), declared in a speech in June, ''The distancing of the borrower from the lender has contributed to the development of lax underwriting standards.'' Rodriguez's point was that investors in the securities, being remote from the actual real estate, could hardly be expected to scrutinize the underlying mortgages loan by loan. Most delegated the task to ratings agencies, and in time the agencies, intoxicated by the booming market, also grew lax. Meanwhile, Wall Street, sensing the appetite of investors, devised exotic ways of repackaging mortgages. Investors bought these securities in bulk, just as Goldman bought stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The absence of scrutiny on Wall Street had a profound effect on mortgage origination. As mortgage bankers discovered that investors would buy virtually any loan whatsoever, they naturally lowered their standards. What difference whether a loan was sound if you could flip it in 48 hours? The market thus corrupted, it only wanted for the right circumstances to implode. And over the last few years, as Robert Barbera, the chief economist at the investment advisory firm ITG, observed, the Federal Reserve took short-term interest rates from 1 percent to 5 1/4 percent. This raised mortgage rates and put home buyers at risk of being priced out of the market. But bankers lent to them anyway, offering, in effect, ''junk mortgages'' -- risky loans with low teaser rates (and much higher rates later), as well as other deviations from sound finance. Lenders and borrowers alike knew that such loans were dicey; they were counting on the borrowers to refinance -- which, as long as home prices kept rising, was a cinch. Naturally, when prices stopped rising, the music stopped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happened over the last generation is that housing was turned from a market that responded to consumers to one largely driven by investors. Liberal mortgage financing pushed home prices higher -- and younger, first-time buyers were effectively priced out of the market. Rates of homeownership are scarcely any higher than in the mid-1960s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no going back to the 3 percent fixed mortgages, single-earner households and tract housing of that era, but housing -- like any investment market -- could surely use a dose of (re-)regulation. At the very least, there should be a clear line between a mortgage company and a casino. Homeowners should not be induced to gamble on mortgages that will leave them insolvent should prices fall. Fewer mortgages might be written, but more mortgagees would stay solvent. And if the mortgage market surrendered a smidgen of its vaunted liquidity, it would be no great loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was John Maynard Keynes who observed the paradox of securities markets: their very liquidity, which investors perceive as a safeguard, creates the conditions for disaster. ''Each individual investor flatters himself that his commitment is 'liquid,' '' Keynes wrote, and the belief that he can exit the market at will ''calms his nerves and makes him much more willing to run a risk.'' The catch is that investors, collectively, can never exit in unison. Whenever they try, panic and losses are the sure result. Once, you had to be a hedge-fund player to experience such a trauma. Now, thanks to the dubious wonders of financial engineering, home buyers are exposed to the very same risks. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUFFOLK COUNTY dropped to 29th in median household income in 2006, from 21st in 2005, on a national list of large counties in a 2006 census report released last week, and its reported poverty rate jumped.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nassau County, however, climbed four spots in the ranking of income to 10th, and its poverty rate was unchanged. Nassau had the highest median income among counties in New York in 2006, at $85,994.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rankings come from the American Community Survey, which reported results for 786 counties with populations of more than 65,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The import of the new numbers was not fully clear last week, because changes in the way the Census Bureau reports data make it hard to compare 2005 and 2006 directly. But economists said the numbers might reflect a growing strain among families who have moved to the periphery of the region's suburbs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The outlying suburbs generally have the youngest families, the most first-time home buyers, and these are people who are operating closest to the financial margins,'' said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, a business group.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a year in which the national poverty rate dropped for the first time in President Bush's tenure, Suffolk's rate climbed to 6.5 percent, from 4.8 percent in 2005. The 2006 numbers at the county level include people living in institutions, like group homes and treatment centers, who were not included in 2005, and it was unclear what impact the change might have had.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nassau's poverty rate was unchanged at 5.2 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nassau has a large proportion of mature households in their prime earning years,'' Dr. Kamer said. ''These people have more discretionary income.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several counties on the edges of the region, like Warren in New Jersey and Putnam and Rockland in New York, experienced increases in reported poverty rates and apparent decreases in median income. The income changes in most cases were within the margin of error of the census surveys, meaning that there is a possibility that the changes were a result of chance.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Putnam's median income, $81,907, ranked 14th nationally in 2006, down from 12th in 2005. Rockland's income, $76,710, was 30th, down from 18th in 2005.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, like Nassau, Westchester's income ranking climbed, to 35th from 37th. Its median income was $75,472. Westchester's poverty rate also declined, to 7 percent from 7.9 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The demographic segment that's growing fastest is the baby boom echo, the group in their 20s,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''Those are young households, and they're probably below the median, so they may be bringing the median down in some outlying areas.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City's poverty rate was virtually unchanged at 19.1 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The county with the highest median income in the country was Fairfax in Virginia, at $100,318, and Loudoun County in Virginia was second, at $99,371. The two counties, both suburbs of Washington, were reversed in 2005, with Loudoun at the top.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five of the top 10 were suburbs of Washington and four were in the New York metropolitan area. Three counties in New Jersey had higher incomes than Nassau: Hunterdon, with a median income of $93,297; Somerset, at $91,688; and Morris, at $89,587.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only county in the top 10 outside the Washington and New York metropolitan areas was Douglas County, Colo., a Denver suburb where the median income was $92,125.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell to a five-year low in July and the glut of unsold properties climbed to the highest since 1991 as the housing slump dragged on.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With no recovery in sight for housing, lower property values and higher mortgage costs threaten to weaken consumer spending, economists said. The Federal Reserve this month acknowledged a growing risk to economic growth because of the rout in credit markets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases declined 0.2 percent, to an annual rate of 5.75 million, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday in Washington. While the retreat was less than forecast, inventories of single-family homes rose to the equivalent of a 9.2 months' supply. Since last year, overall existing sales were down 9 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Midwest accounted for the decline in sales. Purchases declined 2.2 percent in the Midwest and were unchanged in the South. They increased 1 percent in the Northeast and 1.8 percent in the West.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are very likely to see home sales continue to drop,'' said Ethan S. Harris, chief economist at  <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings</span> in New York, who accurately predicted the number. ''There's a big imbalance between supply and demand, with lots of people who want to sell and lots of hesitant buyers.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were projected to fall 0.9 percent, to a 5.7 million annual rate, according to the median estimate of 74 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Predictions ranged from 5.5 million to 6 million. Existing-home sales averaged 6.51 million in 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of an existing home fell to $228,900, a 0.6 percent drop from July a year ago, the Realtors group said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes for sale at the end of the month climbed 5.1 percent, to 4.59 million. At the current sales pace, that represented 9.6 months' worth, up from 9.1 months' worth in the previous month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unfortunately, worse news lies ahead,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. Stricter borrowing rules mean more foreclosures and fewer qualified buyers, which will be ''adding up to lower home sales and lower prices; it is hard to see a bottom before mid-2008.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly figures on home resales are compiled from contract closings and may reflect sales agreed upon weeks or months earlier, while new-home purchases are recorded when a contract is signed, making them a more timely barometer. Resales account for about 85 percent of the housing market.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID LEONHARDT and VIKAS BAJAJ   </div><div>1777 words</div><div>26 August 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of American homes is expected to fall this year for the first time since federal housing agencies began keeping statistics in 1950.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the decline, which could be foreshadowed in a widely followed government price index to be released this week, will probably be modest -- from 1 percent to 2 percent -- but could continue in 2008 and 2009. Rather than being limited to the once-booming Northeast and California, price declines are also occurring in cities like Chicago, Minneapolis and Houston, where the increases of the last decade were modest by comparison.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reversal is particularly striking because many government officials and housing-industry executives had said that a nationwide decline would never happen, even though prices had fallen in some coastal areas as recently as the early 1990s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the housing slump has already rattled financial markets, it has so far had only a modest effect on consumer spending and economic growth. But forecasters now believe that its impact will lead to a slowdown over the next year or two.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For most people, this is not a disaster,'' said Nigel Gault, an economist with Global Insight, a research firm in Waltham, Mass. ''But it's enough to cause them to pull back.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, many families used their homes as a kind of piggy bank, borrowing against their equity and increasing their spending more rapidly than their income was rising. A recent research paper co-written by the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve said that the rise in home prices was the primary reason that consumer borrowing has soared since 2001.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, that financial cushion is disappearing for many families. ''We are having to start from scratch and rebuild for a down payment,'' said Kenneth Schauf, who expects to lose money on a condominium in Chicago he and his wife bought in 2004 and have been trying to sell since last summer. ''We figured that a home is the place to build your wealth, and now it's going on three years and we are back to square one.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an inflation-adjusted basis, the national median price -- the level at which half of all homes are more expensive and half are less -- is not likely to return to its 2007 peak for more than a decade, according to Moody'sEconomy.com, a research firm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless the real estate downturn is much worse than economists are expecting, the declines will not come close to erasing the increases of the last decade. And for many families who do not plan to move, the year-to-year value of their house matters little. The drop is, of course, good news for home buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It does, however, contradict the widely held notion that there is no such thing as a nationwide housing slump. A 2004 report jointly written by the top economists at five organizations -- the industry groups for real estate agents, home builders and community bankers, as well as Fannie Mae and  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the large government-sponsored backers of home mortgages -- was typical. It said that ''there is little possibility of a widespread national decline since there is no national housing market.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Top government officials were more circumspect but still doubted that the prices would decline nationally. Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, said the housing market was not susceptible to bubbles, in part because every local market is different.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, Ben S. Bernanke, then an adviser to President Bush and now the Fed chairman, said ''strong fundamentals'' were the main force behind the rise in prices. ''We've never had a decline in housing prices on a nationwide basis,'' he added.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Global Insight, the research firm, estimates that the home-price index to be released Thursday by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, a regulatory agency, will show a decline of about 1 percent between the first and second quarter of this year. Other forecasters predict that the index will rise slightly in the second quarter before falling later this year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, Global Insight expects a decline of 4 percent, or roughly 10 percent in inflation-adjusted terms, between the peak earlier this year and the projected low point in 2009. In California, prices are expected to decline 16 percent -- or about 20 percent after taking inflation into account.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's index, which compares the sales price of individual homes over time, is intended to describe the actual value of a typical house. Since the index began in 1975, it has slipped from one quarter to the next on a few occasions, but it has never fallen over a full year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another index dating back to 1950, calculated by  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, has also never shown an annual decline. Price data published by the National Association of Realtors, based on the prices of houses sold in a given year, have also never declined. According to the association, the median home price is now about $220,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schauf and his wife, Leslie Suarez, put their condo in the Sheridan Park neighborhood of Chicago up for sale shortly before moving to Texas last year so he could take a new job. They bought the two-bedroom unit in September 2004 for $255,000, with a 5 percent down payment. They redid the floors, installed new window treatments and repainted the walls.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said they expected the condo to sell quickly. Instead, they have cut the price several times and have yet to receive an offer. The current list price is $279,000, though they expect to settle for less.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the money for a new down payment, they are renting an apartment in Austin. They also expect the monthly payment on their adjustable-rate mortgage to go up $200 in October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Suarez, who grew up in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, says she is not as surprised because she remembers home prices falling after the oil bust in the late 1980s. ''Growing up in Texas, real estate has never been a windfall,'' she said. ''For me, I always just wanted to break even.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices have previously declined for long stretches in various regions. Most recently, prices fell in California and in the Northeast during the recession of the early 1990s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current slump is different from that one, though, in both depth and breadth. In fact, the national median price rose only slightly faster than inflation from 1950 to the mid-1990s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as interest rates fell and lending standards became looser, prices started rising rapidly in the late 1990s, even in places like Chicago, which had rarely seen a real estate boom. The result was a ''euphoric popular delusion'' that real estate was a can't-miss investment, said Edward W. Gjertsen II, president of the Financial Planners Association of Illinois. ''That's just human nature.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many families are clearly richer because of the boom. In the Old Town neighborhood of Chicago, the town house that Ian R. Perschke, a technology consultant, and Jennifer Worstell, a lawyer, bought in late 2004 has appreciated more than 30 percent, they estimated. The gain was big enough to allow them to take out a larger mortgage and renovate two rental units in the house. But Mr. Perschke said he understood that he was ''not going to see that appreciation over the next three years.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Chicago peaked in September 2006 and have since dipped 1.7 percent, according to the Case-Shiller home-price index, which is tabulated by MacroMarkets, a research firm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the attention that the uninterrupted growth in national house prices received, some economists argue that it was misplaced. The Case-Shiller index, which many experts consider more accurate than the government measure, did show a drop in prices in the early 1990s. (Unlike the government's measure, it includes mortgages of more than $417,000, which are not held by Fannie Mae or  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac.</span>)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After adjusting for inflation -- the most meaningful way to look at any price, economists say -- even the government's index fell in the early 1990s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dean Baker, an economist in Washington who has been arguing for the last five years that houses were overvalued, said the idea that house prices could go only up had fed the bubble.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was very misleading,'' said Mr. Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal research group. There are a lot of people, he said, who bought ''homes at hugely inflated prices who are going to take a hit. You also have a lot of people who borrowed against those inflated prices.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most prominent housing booster was David Lereah, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors until April. In 2005, he published a book titled, ''Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?'' In 2006, it was updated and rereleased as ''Why the Real Estate Boom Will Not Bust.'' This year, Mr. Lereah published a new book, ''All Real Estate Is Local.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Mr. Lereah, now an executive at  <span class="companylink">Move Inc.</span>, which operates a real estate Web site, acknowledged he had gotten it wrong, saying he did not fully realize how loose lending standards had become and how quickly they would tighten up again this summer. But he argued that many of his critics have also been proved wrong, because they were bearish as early as 2002.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bears were bears way too early, and the bulls were bulls too late,'' he said. ''You need to know when you are straying from fundamentals. It's hard, when you are in the middle of the storm, to know.''   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise in sales of new homes last month provided an unexpected respite from the steady stream of dismal housing market statistics lately, but economists cautioned that it was unlikely to last.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As obtaining a mortgage becomes more difficult even for people with solid credit and the supply of homes continues to far exceed demand, any recovery in the real estate market still appears months away.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one day anyway, investors were cheered by the news and lifted stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 142.99 points, or 1.1 percent, to 13,378.87. The  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index rose 16.87 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,479.37, and the Nasdaq composite index climbed 34.99 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,576.69.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said yesterday that new-home sales, measured at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, rose 2.8 percent in July, to 870,000. It was only the second month this year in which sales of new homes increased from the previous month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the upturn was concentrated in the West, where sales surged 22.4 percent. That helped offset a 24.3 percent plunge in the Northeast and relatively flat sales in the Midwest (down 0.9 percent) and the South (up 0.6 percent).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength on the West Coast, which has the highest median home prices in the country, also helped lift the national median price of a new home, to $239,500 from $230,600 in June.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the improvement they showed, the July statistics predated the credit market squeeze that has roiled the global financial system this month. Since then, banks have tightened borrowing standards considerably for both individuals and businesses, which is expected to put a further drag on home buying.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In July, people were talking about the subprime problems, but they weren't talking about it being a major credit crunch,'' said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist for Commerce Bank. ''Now they're looking at it and recognizing that maybe it's not a full-blown crisis, but it could become one.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effect of the credit tightening -- both in terms of its real effect on mortgage availability and its psychological effect on consumers -- has yet to unfold.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think there's a lot of uncertainty,'' said Celia Chen, the director of housing economics at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''I think potential buyers are going to need to see a little firming in prices. And then I think they'll need to be able to access credit easily. Right now, that's getting harder and harder.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statistics showed that builders continued to hold high levels of unsold inventory. The supply of unsold homes last month fell to 7.5 months from 7.7 months, but that is still far more than the five-month supply that is considered normal. At the end of July, the Commerce Department said 533,000 unsold new homes were on the market, down 7 percent from July 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many homes on the market, economists said prices could continue to fall for some time. Despite the increase last month, the median price of a new home in July was still lower than the 2006 median of $246,500.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in new-home sales last month was out of step with what some of the largest builders have been saying recently about the state of their businesses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major companies like D. R. Horton and  <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> have reported double-digit drops in sales since last year, sagging profits and soaring cancellations. And the National Association of Home Builders said last week that its index of builder confidence hit the lowest level since January 1991.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a survey of more than 300 builders this month, the home builders association found that more and more are cutting prices and adding incentives like upgraded kitchen countertops and fireplaces to sell homes. Fifty-three percent of builders said they had cut prices in the last month, compared with 37 percent a year earlier. Forty-seven percent are paying financing fees and mortgage closing costs for buyers, compared with 38 percent a year earlier. The percentage of builders including upgrades at no additional charge to the buyer rose to 58 percent from 51 percent a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the Commerce Department numbers count home sales when the contract is signed between the homeowner and the builder, they do not capture cancellations. And many builders recently have reported high cancellation rates, suggesting that the July numbers may exaggerate how good the month was for builders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Given the high rate of sales cancellations that home builders have experienced in recent months, it is difficult to get a line of sight to the net sales rates,'' an economist for Global Insight, Brian Bethune, said in a research report.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside the housing market, there were signs that July was a good month for American businesses. The Commerce Department said in a separate report yesterday that orders for durable goods -- heavy-duty items like airplanes, vehicles and computers -- rose 5.9 percent in July, to $12.9 billion.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As more fallout from the mortgage market squeeze becomes apparent, there was yet another sign yesterday that the worst of the trauma in the housing sector may not be over.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of new residential construction and the rate of building permits issued fell last month to their lowest points in more than a decade, the government reported. The picture is even gloomier than it was a year earlier, when the housing market was already in a state of decline.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The annual rate of building permits issued last month stood at 1.4 million, 22.6 percent lower than the rate last July. The rate of construction on new homes also fell to 1.4 million, which was 20.9 percent lower than a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bottom isn't here. It's not even in sight yet,'' said Richard F. Moody, chief economist with Mission Residential, a real estate investment firm in Austin, Tex.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders and developers are scaling back as Americans are finding it more difficult and more expensive to obtain mortgages. And as credit standards tighten across the entire lending industry, mortgage companies are finding it difficult to raise cash and to sell their loan portfolios.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span>, the nation's largest mortgage lender, said yesterday that it had tapped $11.5 billion in emergency loans from 40 of the world's largest banks, seeking to shore up its finances.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difficulties facing mortgage companies have made builders anxious, and they are responding by cutting back, said Michelle Meyer, an economist with  <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers.</span> ''They're aware of what's going on in the mortgage market, and they're concerned about it. And that's adding to pessimism among builders.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest construction numbers showed that every region of the country has felt the squeeze. Compared with a year earlier, the rate of building permits issued in July fell 12.5 percent in the Northeast, 22.2 percent in the Midwest, 25.6 percent in the South and 20.7 percent in the West.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction fell everywhere except in the Northeast, where it increased 6.1 percent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, compared with last July. On an unadjusted basis, however, construction in the Northeast fell.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Midwest, the adjusted rate of construction dropped 17.5 percent. In the South, it fell 26.3 percent; in the West, 21.5 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists worry about a ripple effect if the credit market gets tighter, cutting off loans for more individuals and corporations. Stricter borrowing conditions could cause home sales to fall even more, which could in turn depress prices further. And the effect of falling home prices could cut into consumer spending, which would harm economic growth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The question is how long it persists,'' Ms. Meyer said. ''And timing the bottom is very difficult right now because of all the moving parts.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STOCKTON, Calif., Aug. 11 -- The north end of Clarks Fork Circle in Stockton tells you all you need to know about the depth of the mortgage worries here. On a curve in a handsome new residential development, four of five homes are for sale, at least two of which have already been repossessed by a lender.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Bank Owned!'' advertises a flier for one home. ''New Low Price!'' shouts a sign planted in a different lawn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once considered a safe alternative to the overheated Bay Area real estate market, Stockton and its streets are now filled with ''For Sale'' signs and evidence of foreclosures. While hundreds of thousands of people nationwide are being affected by troubles in the lending market, Stockton has the highest foreclosure rate of any city in the country, according to RealtyTrac, a real estate data firm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is disturbing, there's no question about it,'' said Mayor Edward J. Chavez, who himself has two houses on the market, with no sales in sight. ''A year to two years back, this area was seen as being affordable compared to other areas, the Bay Area, the South Bay. But what was once a vibrant market has kind of hit a brick wall.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sun-baked city of about 285,000 some 90 miles east of San Francisco, Stockton has seen its population swell over the last decade as commuters have continued to push away from the bay in search of more affordable houses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average single-family houses here can still be had for $350,000. But many of the recent house deals, brokers and local officials say, were financed by subprime loans, some of which offered 100 percent financing for a small down payment, occasionally even no money down. But those deals quickly soured for new homeowners when higher monthly payments kicked in after two or three years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's gone from the most liberal financing I've ever seen a few years ago to the most foreclosures and delinquencies I've ever seen now,'' said Art Godi, 71, a longtime Stockton real estate agent and the former president of the National Association of Realtors. ''And there's a connection between those two things, obviously.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the housing market was hot a couple of years ago, Mr. Godi said, house prices here were increasing 20 percent a year. Now, he said, the prices are falling as much as 10 percent to 12 percent a year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deadening market for houses has only worsened problems for people like Alma Neri, a mother of three boys who bought a modest house in Stockton in 2002 for $223,000. Three years later, Ms. Neri and her husband, Juan, found an even better house -- three bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, a two-car garage -- around the corner. The plan was to sell the old house to pay off its mortgage, and live out their days in their dream home.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, both of the Neris' houses are languishing on the market, and the debt from two mortgages -- and an equity loan they took to remodel the new house -- is piling up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We made bad decisions,'' said Ms. Neri, 30, who commutes to her job as a contractor in Pleasanton, about 50 miles to the west. ''We're worried if we don't sell by the end of the year, we will lose one of them. We just didn't see the downturn coming.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a half mile of the Neris' new home, there are more than 100 other homes for sale, Mr. Godi said, many of which are foreclosures.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six California cities rank in the top 10 nationwide for foreclosure rates, according to RealtyTrac, with the top three spots -- Stockton, Modesto and Merced -- situated in the Central Valley, where longtime agricultural towns have turned into small residential cities.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California has the third-highest rate of foreclosures in the country, RealtyTrac says, behind Nevada and Colorado. In July, another real estate data firm,  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, reported that the state had its highest level of foreclosure in two decades, with nearly 54,000 notices of default sent to delinquent homeowners in the second quarter of 2007.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, the California Reinvestment Coalition, a nonprofit group which seeks to promote access to credit in low-income families, wrote to lenders asking for a moratorium on foreclosures.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Immigrants, seniors and people of color are more likely to have been victimized by bad lenders,'' said Kevin Stein, the coalition's associate director. ''But what's evident looking at these numbers is that the problems being faced are cutting across racial and ethnic lines.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, several state leaders called for a forum in Stockton to help people avoid foreclosures, but most people had dallied too long to address the problem. ''There's denial,'' said State Senator Michael J. Machado, a Democrat whose district includes Stockton and who is chairman of the Banking, Finance and Insurance Committee. ''People get into these homes, it's the American dream, and then they wait too long to go to the lender to say they're having problems.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers in Stockton are now increasingly offering so-called short sales, in which a seller is asking for less than the value of the house, hoping to pay off the bulk -- but not the entirety -- of the mortgage. Even so, sales are slow to come, leading to annoyed sellers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're not crazy about us or anybody right now,'' Mr. Godi said. ''They'll say, 'Gee, I lowered the price on my house, why haven't you sold it?' And we want to sell it. We don't get paid until we sell it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''It's much better dealing with people if they're going to make a profit.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: Alma and Juan Neri of Stockton, Calif., bought their dream house in 2005, but as a result are now squeezed by two mortgages; The real estate market in Stockton has no shortage of inventory, which is part of the problem: competition for buyers is tough.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN it comes to covering the waterfront in Narragansett, R.I., the patterns are well established.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out-of-towners head south to the state beach. Families with small children opt for the bayside. Local sun-worshipers and surfers gravitate to the centrally located Narragansett Town Beach, where they happily divvy up the crescent of sand and sea. Such cooperation is worth it, both for the surfers, in search of some of the best waves on the East Coast, and for the bathers, who relish the moderate water temperatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boasting arguably the nicest beaches in New England, Narragansett is often overlooked in favor of its neighbors like Newport or Watch Hill, or established vacation spots like Block Island and Cape Cod. But Narragansett has advantages those places don't, including comparatively reasonable real estate prices, varied housing stock and easy access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not to say Narragansett has escaped the notice of savvy second-home buyers, or that it doesn't have its fair share of ocean-gazing mansions and multimillion-dollar properties. But the same sort of house with the same ocean view in Newport might cost a buyer 10 to 20 percent more, says John Hodnett, a partner in Lila Delman Real Estate, which handles high-end properties in both Newport and Narragansett.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Newport, Narragansett once served as a preferred summer resort for many of New York and Boston society's prominent families, who either maintained ''cottages'' (oceanfront mansions) or stayed at one of the grand Victorian hotels that lined Ocean Road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of the hotels were destroyed by fires in the early 1900s, but several mansions still exist and, in some cases, are still in the hands of the original families. Others have been renovated or rebuilt by corporate executives who spend their summers in Narragansett, or by people like Michael Ice, a former Division 1 college basketball player turned Wall Street investment banker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ice bought a six-bedroom house facing the ocean for $2.5 million in 2002. Since then, he has added a regulation-size basketball court to his three-acre property and is putting in a pool. His wife, Kathi, and their five children spend their summers here, with Mr. Ice joining them on weekends from their primary home in Rye, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he preferred Narragansett to the more typical choice of his colleagues, the Hamptons, or the more obvious Rhode Island destination, Newport. ''I don't take a black tie when I go up there for the summer,'' he said. ''Narragansett is more low key. There's still a little of that blue blood group there, but it's more of a beach town.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While oceanfront mansions are listed in the millions, you don't have to be related to an oil baron to buy in Narragansett. Divided into distinct villages, housing ranges from the small fishing cottages near Point Judith at the southern end of town, to 1970s-style beach houses a little farther north in Eastward Look, to more traditional houses in the central historic district, to California-style homes tucked into a hilly area of Bonnet Shores at the north end of town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With seven miles of oceanfront, plus a bounty of inlets, salt ponds and coves, many homes here have access to water or, at least, water views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting to Narragansett is a big selling point, especially compared to waiting (at Point Judith) for a ferry to Block Island, or being caught on the clogged road that leads to Cape Cod. ''If you want to go home on a Sunday, you might get delayed 20 minutes getting out of here,'' Mr. Hodnett said. ''You're not held hostage like you are on the Cape.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Maryellen Allen's family, the convenience and the pristine beaches were key factors in the decision to buy a beach house in Narragansett rather than in Rye, N.H., their original choice. The Allens discovered Narragansett three years ago, when their son, Tim, became a student at the University of Rhode Island, just 10 minutes inland. The 1960s three-bedroom colonial they bought for $443,000 near Point Judith this spring is two blocks from the ocean and just over an hour's drive from their home in Glastonbury, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes, as a summer-home owner, you feel like you're being a little intrusive, but people don't act that way here,'' Mrs. Allen said. ''People are very nice. They extend themselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Scene</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The white-sand beaches, of course, are a big draw, but there is little commercial activity compared with what's in most other beach towns. Mirroring the distinct neighborhoods, the beaches are defined, too: Narragansett Town Beach draws surfers and year-round residents, while Scarborough State Beach attracts more out-of-towners. The west coast beaches in the Sand Hill Cove area have smaller waves that appeal to young families, while the beaches in the Bonnet Shores area are open only to residents of that neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fishing is popular. Galilee, a village at the town's southern end, is Rhode Island's largest commercial fishing port. Visitors can take a charter and do their own fishing, or wait for fishing boats loaded with lobster and tuna to come in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in town, the Towers, a granite structure that crosses over Ocean Road, is all that remains of the once famous Narragansett Pier Casino, destroyed by a fire in 1900. The Towers serve as a visitors center today and the site of year-round social and cultural activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pros</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the clear evidence of wealth, Narragansett still feels like a real town, where local teenagers hang out at the beach and restaurants are run by University of Rhode Island graduates. A downtown redevelopment plan will soon bring a fancy supermarket and upscale condominiums to the town's central waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cons</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Galilee is all but overrun by traffic to and from the Block Island ferry. This fishing village and the downtown Pier area are in danger of being overly commercialized by developers who see an opportunity to tap into the growing interest in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Real Estate Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents estimate that 40 to 50 percent of Narragansett's homeowners are seasonal. A large number of second-homers come from New England or the suburbs of New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As more buyers have discovered Narragansett, home values have risen. From 2000 to 2005, the median price jumped from $163,800 to $360,700. And the median today has edged to more than $500,000, agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about 217 houses currently on the market; 22 are listed at more than $1 million. Houses range from modest Capes and ranches inland that list in the mid-$300,000s, to Dunmere Gatehouse, an 1880 stone mansion on 3.5 acres of sweeping oceanfront property listing at $6.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historic houses are concentrated in the downtown Pier neighborhood: a converted five-bedroom carriage house built in 1900 and updated in 2006 lists at $1.095 million, while a 2,740-square-foot 1890 Victorian on Boon Street lists at $649,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being near the water will cost you: a 636-square-foot cottage on the beach in Sand Hill Cove lists for $895,000, while a two-bedroom ranch with oceanviews in Bonnet Shores lists at $925,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">L AY O F T H E L A N D</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 8 -- The luxury home builder  <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> reported a 21 percent decline in preliminary home building revenue for the third quarter and said the housing market was so volatile that it would not give earnings guidance.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors, a trade group for real estate agents, lowered its outlook for existing-home sales this year by 1 percent, or 70,000 homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert I. Toll,  <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>' usually ebullient chief executive, remained cautious. ''With the uncertainties roiling the mortgage markets right now, the pace of home sales could slow further until the credit markets settle down,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said that  <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, which has a mortgage-lending business, had not been as directly affected by the problems of subprime borrowers, but they added that it did have greater exposure to buyers with jumbo loans and those stretching to qualify for loans larger than their incomes might justify.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its sales nonetheless beat analysts' expectations, and the stock rose $1.38, or 6 percent, to $24.33.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll, the nation's largest building of luxury homes, said it expected to report revenue of $1.21 billion for the quarter that ended July 31, down from $1.5 billion for the same quarter last year, when it releases earnings on Aug. 22.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial on average were expecting revenue of $1.08 billion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things could have been worse,'' said Gregory E. Gieber, an analyst with A. G. Edwards. ''Orders have fallen back to where they were before the boom.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, based in Horsham, Pa., said it was taking pretax write-downs of $125 million to $175 million in the quarter on homes it could not sell for a profit, as well as on land options that the company was abandoning.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the third quarter,  <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> said revenue in its Western region was hit the hardest, down 24 percent, to $321.7 million. The North was down 22 percent, to $293.4 million. Close behind was the Middle Atlantic, down 21.6 percent, to $350.7 million. The South fell 14 percent, to $242.2 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association's revised forecast calls for existing-home sales of 6.04 million in 2007, down from July's prediction of 6.11 million for the year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group said it expected median existing-home prices nationwide to fall 1.2 percent, to a median of $219,300 this year before climbing back next year to $223,600.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With the population growing, the demand for homes isn't going away, it's just being delayed,'' Lawrence Yun, the group's senior economist, said. ''More buyers and cutbacks in new construction will eventually draw down the inventory levels and support future price appreciation, but general gains will be modest next year. Serious buyers today have a long-term view of housing as an investment -- speculators have left the market.''   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN it comes to Westchester's housing market these days, ''what's to complain about?'' the chief executive of the County Board of Realtors, P. Gilbert Mercurio, asked last week. ''Prices are holding their own, things aren't worsening and the volume of sales, while not record-setting, isn't poor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mercurio said that even the median sale price for a single-family home remained relatively stable at $700,000 -- just $15,000 short of the record for the county, set in the second quarter of last year, according to figures released Wednesday by the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, a subsidiary of the County Board of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the average sale price of a single-family house was $965,414 -- 3 percent higher than last year -- ''which means that some pretty expensive transactions took place,'' Mr. Mercurio said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in excess of $1 million represented 28 percent of the market, according to the listing service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes rose 1.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with last year, and Realtors participating in the listing service reported closing 4,269 residential transactions in Westchester in the first six months of the year, 1 percent more than in the first half of 2006. That rate of closings, if sustained for the rest of the year, would yield a total of about 9,800 sales for 2007, which would rank it fifth in total sales volume, after 2005, 2004, 1999 and 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, Mr. Mercurio said the market, instead of soaring or falling, had settled ''at a fairly high and healthy level.'' Looking ahead, he said, there is no reason to expect further erosion of sales volumes or prices, absent problems arising from subprime mortgage financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the president of the listing service, Mark Boyland, also a broker with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in White Plains, was troubled by a decrease in inventory. At the end of last month, according to the report, there were 7,140 active residential listings posted with the listing service, a decrease of 8 percent from a year ago. The inventory for single-family houses was down by nearly 11 percent, with only condominiums posting an increase -- about 3 percent, to 926 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures for second-quarter inventory ended a 12-quarter run of year-to-year increases that ranged from 2 percent in 2004 to 38 percent in the first quarter of 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem, Mr. Boyland said, is that some sellers have become discouraged and taken their properties off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sellers often get a number in their heads about what their house is worth,'' he said, ''and it takes a long time for them to come to grips with what the property is truly worth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except for sales of multifamily houses, second-quarter price changes were minimal compared with a year ago, the report shows. The median for single-family houses was down about 2 percent; for condos, it decreased less than 1 percent, to $382,500; and for co-ops, it was up almost 2 percent, to $193,000, the second-highest level on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price of a two-to-five-family house, though, dropped 5.6 percent, to $547,500, at the end of June, compared with the same period a year ago. Investors who had been disenchanted with the stock market's performance several years ago and tried to diversify their portfolio by buying multifamily housing were twice thwarted, said Darryl R. Selsey, owner of Four Seasons Real Estate Center in Mount Vernon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At end of day, when you calculate all the expenses for owning and renting out a multifamily home, you're lucky if you even break even,'' Mr. Selsey said. The only time owning a multifamily dwelling makes sense, he said, is when the owner lives there and uses it to offset monthly mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the numbers in the report represented good news, said Harding Mason, president of the County Board of Realtors and an associate broker with Houlihan Lawrence in Katonah. ''Especially compared to some of the horror stories we're hearing in other parts of the country,'' he said, ''Westchester isn't in any trouble at all.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, July 26 (AP) -- Sales of new homes fell in June by the largest amount in five months as the housing industry continued to struggle with its worst downturn in 16 years. The median home price also fell.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported Thursday that sales of new single-family homes dropped by 6.6 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 834,000 units. The decline was more than triple what had been expected and was the largest percentage drop since sales fell by 12.7 percent in January. Sales are now 22.3 percent below the level of a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home sold last month dropped to $237,900, down by 2.2 percent from a year ago. It was the biggest year-over-year price drop since a 6.5 percent fall in April. The median price is the point where half the homes sold for more and half for less.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report Wednesday showed that sales of existing homes dropped by 3.8 percent in June, to a five-year low. The weakness reflects spreading troubles in the mortgage market as more borrowers default on their loans, putting those homes back on an already glutted market. In addition, banks and other lenders are tightening their standards, making it harder for prospective buyers to qualify for loans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region of the country, sales of new homes fell 27.1 percent in the Northeast, 22.5 percent in the West and 17.1 percent in the Midwest. Only the South saw an increase in sales, a gain of 7.6 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say they believe the weakness in housing could linger through the rest of this year, until a huge overhang of unsold homes is worked down. For June, the inventory of unsold new homes was unchanged at 537,000 units.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news, the Commerce Department said that orders for big-ticket manufactured products increased 1.4 percent last month, the best showing since a 5.1 percent increase in March. Orders declined 2.3 percent in May.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The June strength in durable goods orders was concentrated in orders for commercial airplanes, which soared 28.7 percent, reflecting strong demand for  <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> aircraft. Aircraft orders, which are extremely volatile from month to month, fell 21 percent in May.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of newly laid off workers filing claims for unemployment benefits fell to 301,000 last week, a drop of 2,000 from the previous week. Economists had been expecting a slight rise.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say they believe that the economy regained momentum in the spring after a lackluster start to the year. Economic growth slowed to a dismal annual rate of 0.7 percent from January through March, the weakest showing in more than four years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government will report on April-June growth on Friday, and many analysts say they believe the report will show a solid rebound, to growth of around 3.2 percent, despite the housing industry troubles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report on orders for durable goods showed that many sectors other than aircraft declined last month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall transportation orders were up 6.1 percent, but that reflected the 28.7 percent jump in demand for commercial airliners and a 9.9 percent rise in orders for military aircraft. Orders for autos were down 1.4 percent last month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of transportation, orders fell by 0.5 percent, reflecting weakness in a number of categories. That was the second consecutive drop in orders excluding transportation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, a category that is considered a good proxy for business investment, fell by 0.7 percent last week after an even bigger 1.5 percent decline in May.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sectors showing weakness were primary metals, including steel, which dropped by 3.6 percent, and computers and electronic products, down 4.6 percent.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, July 25 (AP) -- Sales of existing homes fell in June for a fourth consecutive month, further evidence that housing troubles are far from over.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported Wednesday that sales of existing homes dropped by 3.8 percent in June, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.75 million units. That is the slowest sales pace since November 2002, and the decline was about twice what had been expected.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of an existing home edged up to $230,100, 0.3 percent more than a year ago. The median is the point where half the homes sold for more and half for less.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the first price gain in 11 months. Analysts, however, said that they expected prices to fall further because of the high number of unsold homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For June, the median price of a single-family home rose by 0.1 percent and the price of a condominium increased by 2.6 percent when compared with the period a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With inventories still way out of line, unless prices fall a lot more, the housing market will not turn around any time soon,'' said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said the economy expanded in June and early July. But most Fed regions reported further declines in residential construction and real estate activity.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told Congress last week that he expected housing to be a less severe drag on growth in the coming months. Many private economists are not as optimistic. They note that existing-home sales fell at an annual rate of 28 percent from April through June, the steepest in the downturn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing is contracting at an accelerating pace, taking out with a vengeance the brief stabilization at the turn of the year,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, a private forecasting firm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing slump follows five boom years when sales of new and existing homes set records and home prices soared by double-digit rates. Since late 2005, sales have slumped as mortgage rates rose and prospective buyers balked at selling prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those problems have worsened in recent months because of troubles in the subprime mortgage market, which offered loans to buyers with spotty credit histories. Rising mortgage defaults are adding more homes onto an oversupplied market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span>, one of the largest mortgage lenders, reported a sharp decline in second-quarter profit because of an increasing number of loans going bad. That sent jitters through financial markets and led to a 226-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average Tuesday. Investors are worried that the problems in subprime lending could drag down the economy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declines in existing-home sales in June covered all parts of the country. Sales fell by 7.3 percent in the Northeast, 6.8 percent in the West, 2.8 percent in the Midwest and 1.7 percent in the South.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David F. Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders, said the unexpected weakness in recent months had caused him to shave his forecast for housing construction this year. It now shows a fall of 23 percent after a 14 percent drop in 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Seiders said that he expected only a 2 percent rise in 2008 and that the weakness would last longer than in previous housing dips.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of unsold homes dropped by 4.2 percent in June, to 4.2 million units. That level, however, still was seen as a drag on the market. Some analysts said part of the decline occurred because disappointed owners pulled their homes off the market or decided to rent rather than sell.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors are forecasting that sales of existing homes will fall by 5.6 percent this year and prices will drop by 1.4 percent. That would be the first annual price decline based on records that the Realtors have kept for more than four decades.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Centre Island, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEARLY every room in Southerly, Patricia Altschul's elegant 15-room Georgian-style home, overlooks Oyster Bay Harbor. The property, hidden behind Chippendale-style gates and down a verdant allée of towering linden trees, has more than 10 acres of luxuriant grounds, with topiaries, formal hedges, rose gardens, rolling lawns, a swimming pool and a sandy beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10,000-square-foot house, built in 1958, has eight bedrooms, eight and a half baths, an elevator, a library, a sunroom and a servants' wing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with the $32.5 million Billy Joel is asking for his 14,000-square-foot beachfront home down the street, Ms. Altschul's asking price of $15.8 million is a bargain. And her estate, unlike Mr. Joel's, has a deepwater dock. (Though his 14.5-acre spread does include an acoustically correct music room, a bowling alley and a Cuban cigar bar.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But finding a buyer for a top-tier home is not a cinch in a soft market. Ms. Altschul's home has been for sale for about a year, she said; she decided to sell it after the death in 2002 of her husband, Arthur, the banker and philanthropist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help it stand out among the more than 100 homes in Nassau County listed at $5 million or more as of mid-July, Ms. Altschul let Daniel Gale <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, her brokers, hold an invitation-only wine tasting at her home in conjunction with <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> wine division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is all done with the utmost consideration and care,'' Ms. Altschul said on a recent Sunday afternoon, sitting in her English-country-style library as more than 100 guests strolled through her living room onto a canopied bluestone terrace toward two tents set up for sampling summer wines. ''You really want the word to get out, but it has to be done in the most discreet and exclusionary way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To keep tire kickers out, and ensure that those who view a home can actually afford to buy it, public open houses are not held at the top end of the market, according to real estate brokers in the metropolitan area; instead, the brokers are turning to a more sophisticated sell, luxury real estate soirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't have an open house, but I would do this,'' Ms. Altschul said. She did not mind hobnobbing with the high-level executives, lawyers and top-producing brokers from Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn., as well as other <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> clients invited to the wine-tasting party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are the type of clients that I am happy to meet and happy to know,'' she said. ''It's a big difference.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patricia Petersen, president and chief executive officer of Daniel Gale, which has its headquarters in Huntington, on Long Island, said that with more houses currently for sale at the high end than she had seen at any time in the past 25 years, they take longer to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is nothing we won't do to reach out,'' Ms. Petersen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last June in New Canaan, Conn., at a modern Philip Johnson-designed home on five acres that was on the market for $4.25 million, about 75 owners of contemporary homes attended a lecture by James Zemaitis, head of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> 20th-century decorative arts department. In October, the home sold for $3.75 million through William Pitt <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, which has its headquarters in Stamford, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last October, Ms. Petersen's company hosted an invitation-only cocktail party for 300 guests at Northwood, a $36 million, 60-acre estate in Oyster Bay Cove that included a display of $40 million worth of jewelry from <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> diamond collection. (Thirty-three and a half acres bordering a county preserve were sold on Wednesday to Nassau County; the 24-room main house and remaining 26-plus acres, stables, carriage house and indoor tennis court are available for $20 million.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BETH LAFFEY, the auction liaison between <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span>, the auction house, and <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> said dual-purpose parties were ''great exposure for selling houses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Gerry Logue, an entertainment consultant who also builds and markets houses, used what he called his ''premiere/launch'' strategy to stage an ''opening night'' for his latest production, a new $3.24 million waterfront home in Sag Harbor, on Long Island. Art enthusiasts, real estate professionals and friends from the Hamptons and Manhattan were invited to a combination cocktail party and art exhibition featuring photographs by E. J. Camp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It brought the house to life,'' Mr. Logue said. The house did not sell, but nine of Ms. Camp's landscapes and celebrity portraits did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parties given by brokers for other brokers are also common in the high price bracket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you are targeting luxury and high-end properties, our experience is that you have to go the extra distance,'' said Harding Mason, president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors and an associate broker at Houlihan Lawrence in Katonah, N.Y. ''Part of high-end marketing today is networking with other luxury brokers, as well as the hosting of the luncheons and teas and cocktail parties.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, preview parties for newly listed homes were held only for local brokers, said Suzanne Bijou, marketing director for Luxury Country Properties, a division of Houlihan Lawrence in Bedford, N.Y. But with the swell of mansions on the market, top-producing brokers from other areas are more often the focus of events, including a tea party last month at a $20 million listing in Rye, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Often people looking in Rye are also looking in Greenwich,'' Ms. Bijou said. ''We want the Greenwich brokerage community to know what is available down here and vice versa.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bergen County, N.J., 52 homes for sale were priced at $5 million and above as of mid-July, including Eddie Murphy's Englewood estate, for $19.5 million, and Russell Simmons's $23.8 million, 35,000-square-foot estate in Saddle River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephanie Rosken, a sales associate with Prominent Properties <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> office in Tenafly, N.J., said that for high-end homes, she sends out formal invitations to luncheons to top-producing brokers. When it comes to celebrity houses, she is more discreet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't do a tea party in Eddie Murphy's house,'' said Ms. Rosken, who is handling Mr. Simmons's listing. Meredyth Hull Smith, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> in Manhattan, specializes in the upper end in Manhattan, but she said she came to the wine tasting at the Altschul estate in case any of her city clients were looking for a country home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Having seen some of the important properties such as this, you can say, 'As a matter of fact, there is this great house on the water,' '' Ms. Hull Smith said, noting that the estate would probably be one of several residences for a potential buyer. ''There is that synergy between the various different markets, particularly on the upper end. At the top of the point of the pyramid, it's a small world.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driven mostly by rising food prices, the Consumer Price Index, the nation's best-known inflation barometer, rose by two-tenths of a percent in June, the smallest increase since January, the government reported yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food prices, having risen steadily all year, appear to be overtaking gasoline as a source of inflation. Gasoline prices, now just above $3 a gallon on average, fell slightly in June and might do so again in July, surveys suggest.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing slump, on the other hand, held down home costs, the biggest single item in the C.P.I. market basket. As a result, the so-called core inflation rate -- excluding the often volatile fluctuations in food and energy prices -- was 0.2 percent in June, and 2.2 percent over the last 12 months. The overall index, including food and energy, is up 2.7 percent over the past year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The underlying inflation rate is tame,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody'sEconomy.com. ''But that is not a whole lot of solace for the average American who is spending a record amount for gasoline, and now food prices are approaching record highs.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the food category, grocery prices have risen at an annual rate of 8 percent so far this year. ''You have to go all the way back to the 1980s to get a figure larger than 8 percent,'' said Patrick C. Jackman, a senior economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the C.P.I.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising transportation costs are helping to push up all food prices, Mr. Jackman said. So is the growing cost of corn and soybeans. These basic ingredients in animal feed are increasingly being diverted to the manufacture of ethanol, and as feedstock prices rise, so does the cost of beef, poultry and pork.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if food prices are rising sharply, going up 0.5 percent in June, housing costs are not, and housing is the largest item in the C.P.I., accounting for nearly 24 percent of the national inflation rate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses an ''owner's equivalent rent'' to calculate the cost of housing. This equivalent is essentially what a homeowner would pay if he were renting his home. With the inventory of unsold houses piling up in many neighborhoods, the owner's equivalent rent is rising ever more slowly: up at an annual rate of 2.5 percent so far this year compared with 4.3 percent last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Commerce Department report yesterday added to the evidence of downward pressure on housing costs. While housing starts -- the beginning of new construction -- rose 2.3 percent in June, to an annual rate of 1.467 million, housing permits dropped precipitously, the report said. Housing permits, a barometer of future construction, plunged 4.1 percent for single-family homes, apparently in response to a growing inventory of empty houses, neither sold or rented.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just about every housing indicator that has come out recently has been a bad one,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist at Global Insights.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were other increases. Medical care, college textbooks, tobacco and airline fares all were up in June. Airline fares fell last year, but rising fuel costs have helped to push up fares in 2007, along with filled planes, which ''has stopped some of the fare discounting,'' Mr. Jackman of the statistics bureau said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mild inflation rate in recent months adds to the Federal Reserve's flexibility in setting interest rates, said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist for  <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs.</span> ''It is giving the Fed flexibility to keep rates where they are or bring them down if the economy were to weaken,'' Mr. Hatzius said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that the real estate market is supposed to be in free fall, some strange things have been happening recently in Mill Valley.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is one of the expensive suburbs of San Francisco just over the Golden Gate Bridge, and much of the housing market there seems to be doing just fine. One three-bedroom house sold for $1.4 million last month without ever being officially put on the market. The seller accepted a pre-emptive bid -- $20,000 above the asking price -- from somebody who had heard that the house was about to be listed for sale.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The homes that are having a hard time selling are the average-priced homes,'' said Vanessa Justice, a real estate agent with Pacific Union GMAC in the Bay Area, where the median house price is about $750,000. For upper-end homes, she said, ''it's actually pretty crazy right now.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a while since real estate agents used the word ''crazy'' in a positive way, but Ms. Justice is onto something here: the high end of the market is surviving the slump much better than any other segment. Even as foreclosures keep rising and overall sales continue to plummet, more expensive homes have staged a bit of a comeback in recent months. They're spending less time languishing on the market than others, and their prices appear to be holding up better.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This split in the market helps explain why the sales of Manhattan apartments, some of the priciest homes in the country, have remained fairly strong. The national trend has gone largely unnoticed, though, because neither the federal government nor the National Association of Realtors -- the main sources of housing data -- report statistics for different price segments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after just about every home sale, documents must be filed with a local government office. A research firm called  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems gathers these records, and a New York Times analysis of them shows that the story of today's real estate market is really two different stories.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Boston area, for instance, the number of homes selling for at least $1 million plummeted to 619 in the first five months of 2006, from 773 in the period in 2005, according to  <span class="companylink">DataQuick.</span> But the number jumped to 711 in the first five months of this year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the New York region, sales at the top end -- that is, homes in the most expensive 5 percent of the market -- have also been rising, while they have been falling in the middle and bottom of the market. The same is true in the San Jose, Calif.; Seattle; Denver; and Houston areas. In San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Miami, high-end sales are down but not by nearly as much as sales in other price segments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate statistics from the California Association of Realtors also show million-dollar-plus homes to be selling better than others in that state.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high-end market is far from booming, to be sure. Many houses would still sell for less today than they would have a year ago. But the market has stayed strong enough to catch a lot of buyers and sellers off guard. They keep hearing about a real estate meltdown and then finding a different reality when they go to make a deal.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A three-bedroom apartment around the corner from the Guggenheim Museum, on 88th Street near Fifth Avenue, was recently put on the market for $2.8 million, and the first bid came in slightly lower than that. Ten days -- and nine bids -- later, the seller accepted an offer about $500,000 above the asking price.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brookline, Mass., near Coolidge Corner, a big Victorian house went on the market for $1.4 million this spring -- just as it had in 2006, without selling. ''I thought it was still overpriced,'' said Chobee Hoy, the seller's real estate agent. Yet the house ended up selling for about $30,000 more than the asking price.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seem to be three main causes of the split in the market. The first is that affluent families continue to do better than others, thanks to healthy income gains and a rising stock market. ''To some extent, it is the rich getting richer,'' Andrew LePage, an analyst at  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, explained. ''The folks who don't rely solely on a weekly or monthly paycheck seem to be doing better.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upper end of the market has also been helped by an influx of well-off foreign investors whose buying power has grown with the recent decline of the dollar. Hard as this may be for an American to imagine, New York, San Francisco or Miami can now seem like a bargain, compared with London, Moscow or Sydney. Jason Haber, an agent with Prudential Douglas Elliman in Manhattan, said he had recently taught himself how to convert square feet into square meters -- you divide by 10.8 -- because of all of the international buyers traipsing through New York apartments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, both the recent rise in interest rates and the problems in the mortgage market have had a much bigger effect on low-income and middle-class buyers than affluent ones. It's become harder to get a subprime mortgage, while the uptick in interest rates this year has added about $100 to the monthly payment on an average fixed-rate 30-year mortgage.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody'sEconomy.com, summed up the market: ''The low end is getting creamed. The middle is struggling. The high end is running on its own dynamic.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's tempting to conclude, then, that the top of the housing market has somehow become bubble-proof. And some real estate agents will doubtless make this pitch to buyers who are on the fence. But it is almost certainly wrong.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the very top of the housing market -- the sprawling vacation homes and 10,000-square-foot mansions -- seems to be doing considerably worse than merely expensive homes. Ines Hegedus-Garcia, an agent in Miami, recently looked at sales volumes there and found the market for homes that cost $1.2 million to $2.5 million to be holding up decently. The situation was much worse for those priced above $2.5 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also a couple of areas, like Washington and San Diego, where the high end of the market, broadly defined, is already doing about as badly as everything else. So perhaps the recent comeback won't last long in other cities.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember, it's not as if the wealthy are immune to irrational exuberance. Just think back to the 1990s -- or the 1920s. Any asset can end up becoming overvalued. Right now, though, there is a bit more of a rational explanation for home values at the high end of the market.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY   </div><div>973 words</div><div>3 July 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing prices are falling in many parts of the country, the cost of a Manhattan apartment is continuing to rise over all. But a stark divide is emerging between the prices of co-ops and condominiums. More buyers are choosing condominiums over co-ops and are paying far more for them, according to studies being released today.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a condo in Manhattan rose by as much as 28 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with last year, according to data tracked by four large real estate brokerages. In the same period, the average co-op price dropped by as much as 10 percent. Buyers paid an average of $1.49 million for a condominium, compared with $1.13 million for a co-op, according to figures from Brown Harris Stevens.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn did not share Manhattan's price rise. There were more deals, but the average apartment price dropped by 4 percent, to $629,000, compared with last year, according to data from  <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decrease in the average price paid for co-ops in Manhattan does not mean that co-ops are dying; to some degree, it just shows that apartments sold in the quarter included a lot of small co-ops and a number of large condos, according to Brown Harris Stevens. In fact, in terms of average price per room, that brokerage found that postwar co-ops on the East Side remained the same and those on the West Side increased by 3 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But brokers said that co-ops are also depressing their own prices because their boards require so much liquidity and assets that many buyers from overseas and people who work in finance are instead choosing condos. Hall Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said that foreign buyers, especially Russians, have been snapping up sprawling multimillion-dollar condominiums. ''In the past, a lot bought pied-a-terres,'' he said. ''We see a lot of foreign buyers are buying very large apartments.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also choose condos because they would probably not be approved by co-op boards, which often demand full-time residence. Pamela Liebman, the president of  <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said buyers also prefer the conveniences of new buildings and the perks like concierges who can ''stock my refrigerator, get my theater tickets and have my dog groomed.'' The dazzle of living in a new building doesn't hurt either, she said. ''New, new, new -- all of the foreign buyers love that.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dottie Herman, the president of the brokerage Prudential Douglas Elliman, said co-op boards may be forced to change their rules. ''I've brought buyers that have tons of money, that have tons of assets, and still the co-op boards turn them down for no reason at all,'' she said. ''I do think that you're going to see co-ops ease up in some cases. The prices have gone up so much that some of the rules don't work today.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, buyers who can afford multimillion-dollar apartments are forced to buy condos or risk rejection from co-op boards because they are required to have a multiple of the apartment's price in liquid assets. Michele Kleier, president of Gumley Haft Kleier, said buyers in the $3.5 million to $4 million price range are choosing apartments in new buildings like the Lucida, at 151 East 85th Street, where they can live on the Upper East Side but avoid dealing with a co-op board and the extensive renovations that are often needed for a prewar apartment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difficulty of getting past a co-op board is making it tough on sellers, she said. One of her listings was a Park Avenue apartment that required extensive renovations. Five buyers offered roughly the asking price, $4.95 million, but none had the extensive assets required by the board. The price was reduced to $4.75 million, and it ultimately sold for even less to a bidder who had assets acceptable to the board.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I looked at every single balance sheet and there was not one person among the five offers who had the assets to get into the building,'' Ms. Kleier said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These eager and rich buyers are swallowing up the stock of condos. Today, Manhattan has just 5,237 apartments up for sale, compared with 7,640 condos and co-ops for sale last year at the same time, according to data tracked by the appraisal firm Miller Samuel.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, said inventory is also shrinking because potential buyers had been renting until they were sure the market had stabilized. ''They have re-entered the market,'' he said. ''We've essentially eliminated most of the fat out of the inventory.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among condos, the fastest price growth was among entry-level studios. The highest price increase in any size category was in the studio market, according to Brown Harris Stevens data. The average studio rose 26 percent to $574,197.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The smaller units led the way in terms of price increases on the condo side,'' said Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared market studies for Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan's wealthiest buyers are paying even more money to get the most prized trophy homes, and they are not deterred by co-op board rules on assets. Brown Harris Stevens data showed that prices for co-ops with more than four bedrooms rose by 19 percent to an average of $7.016 million, compared with the same period a year ago. Town house prices also increased by 30 percent to $1,644 a square foot.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for Brooklyn town houses did not change, Mr. Heym said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, June 25 (AP) -- Reflecting further housing troubles, sales of existing homes fell in May to the lowest level in four years while the median home price dropped for a record 10th consecutive month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported Monday that sales of existing single-family homes and condominiums dropped by 0.3 percent to 5.99 million units in May, the slowest sales pace since June 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a home sold last month dropped to $223,700, down 2.1 percent from a year ago. It was the 10th straight price decline compared with a year ago, the longest stretch of weakness on record.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales decline reflected weakness in the South, where sales dropped by 3.4 percent, and the West, where sales were down by 0.8 percent. Sales actually showed strength in the Northeast, rising by 5.8 percent, and the Midwest, where they were up 0.7 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a troubling sign for the future, the inventory of unsold homes rose by 5 percent, to 4.43 million units in May, a level that would take 8.9 months to clear at the May sales pace. That is the highest inventory level since the last deep slump in housing in 1992.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said housing was currently being hurt by high inventories and the recent crisis in subprime mortgages, which has caused lenders to tighten their standards, making it harder for potential buyers to qualify for loans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said that all of the housing troubles seemed to be causing a crisis of confidence, leading people to delay decisions to buy homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think psychological factors are currently the biggest drag on the housing market, in addition to a disruption from tighter credit for subprime borrowers,'' said Lawrence Yun, senior economist with the Realtors association.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Household formation has slowed dramatically since late 2006, implying that many people are doubling up,'' he said. ''They're adding roommates or moving in with parents.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current slump in housing is the worst since the 1989-92 downturn. It is occurring after a prolonged boom in which sales of new and existing homes set records for five consecutive years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts believe that the median home price, the point at which half the homes sold for more and half for less, will continue falling until builders further cut back on production of new homes coming to market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in sales was in line with expectations, providing relief on Wall Street where analysts had been braced for an even worse showing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors association is predicting that the median home price will decline by 1.3 percent this year while sales are forecast to drop by 4.6 percent. It would be the first annual price decline in four decades of record keeping by the group.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A chart with the Off the Charts column in Business Day on Saturday, about the inventory of homes for sale, referred incorrectly to the number of unsold houses. They were in the thousands, not hundreds. A corrected graphic is online at nytimes.com/business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Wed Jun 27 2007    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE American housing market, as measured by home-building activity, is falling at the most rapid rate in decades, underscoring the pain felt by builders who were far too optimistic about the state of the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the plunge, however, starts have been very high relative to the number of homes that builders are trying to sell, a fact that could indicate the weakness will last while builders seek to sell homes they have already built.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accompanying charts on housing starts show the total number of single-family homes begun in rolling 12-month periods, and compare that with the number begun in the period ended a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12 months through May, 1.27 million single-family homes were started, a figure that is 25 percent below the number started in the 12 months through May 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid fall clearly caught builders by surprise, in part because many of them had never seen anything like it. During the period covered by the charts, going back to 1990, the fastest fall had been in 1991, when the pace fell 18 percent during a recession.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been such rapid declines before, but not in the memory of most current builders. In 1975, amid the most severe recession since the Great Depression, the decline was 37 percent, the highest recorded since the government started collecting the statistics in 1963. There was also a large drop in 1982, during a recession that came when interest rates were extraordinarily high.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the economy went into recession in 2001, however, the annual decline was never as high as 6 percent. That recession was the only one that had virtually no effect on the housing market, as repeated interest rate reductions from the Federal Reserve served to reinvigorate building quickly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the rate of decline over the last year was high, the level of housing starts, as can be seen, is still higher than it was for most of the 1990s, which could indicate it has further to decline.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most analyses of housing starts do not look at the annual totals cited here; instead, they look at seasonally adjusted annual rates. That figure for May was 1.17 million homes, well below the 12-month total. It has stabilized since hitting bottom in January, which led some analysts to conclude that the worst was over for housing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seasonal adjustments are, however, significant and those numbers can show significant fluctuations even when the market is steady, as weather conditions lead builders to move starts forward or back from what they might have planned. While the annual rate fell in May, the actual number of homes started was virtually unchanged from April.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other charts show the trend in the number of new homes on the market, through April. (May figures will be released Tuesday.) The inventory of new homes for sale rose to the highest level ever last summer, at 573,000 homes in July, and has since begun to fall, going down to 538,000 in April.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that figure was equal to 40 percent of the home starts in the previous year, the highest level ever. It is unlikely that home starts will turn up significantly until that inventory is significantly reduced.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: "New-home starts plunge at fastest pace in decades" The charts show the building of new homes from 1990 to present.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT 2-bedroom condominium   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHERE San Diego   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My search for a condo went on for about a year. I had actually looked at a unit in this same building last year and put a bid on it, but the counteroffer from the seller wasn't good enough, so my search continued.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of months passed and I thought I would take another look at this building and see what, if anything, was available. It turned out there was a condo on the market right next to the one I had bid on earlier, and it was a more desirable corner unit. I ended up paying $44,000 less than the original asking price, which was in the mid-$400,000 range. A buyer had dropped out of escrow so I was able to go in and scoop it up. Even better, my final price was $34,000 less than the counteroffer I got from the seller of that other unit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My condo, which faces a courtyard, is newly renovated, and the entire building just got a facelift. I live in San Diego, and after I sold my house in Los Angeles I was looking for an investment property. This condo is also a place that I imagine my family can use. Searching for a home in a market like this involved a lot of online research. With city records I was able to compare the sale prices of similar properties in the neighborhood.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were coming down over that year. The agency I worked with, ZipRealty, has a tool on its Web site that tracks all properties with price reductions. Between that and my own research, I was able to not only establish what was happening to prices, but also figure out just how much I wanted to offer. After a yearlong search, I closed on my condo this spring.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, June 19 -- Construction of new homes fell in May as the nation's home builders were battered by the crisis in subprime lending and rising mortgage rates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing, which is struggling through its biggest downturn in 16 years, is expected to continue to face troubles in the months ahead before starting to rebound in 2008.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that construction of new homes and apartments dropped by 2.1 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.474 million units, 24.2 percent below the level of a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The May decline was in line with expectations and reflected weakness in the South and West, which offset construction gains in the Northeast and Midwest.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits, considered a good barometer of future activity, rose by 3 percent in May but that came after a huge 7.1 percent plunge in April. The strength last month came from a rebound in permits for apartment construction, which can be volatile. Applications for single-family homes fell by 1.8 percent last month, and have been down four of the last five months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The downward trend remains firmly in place and there is no prospect of any near-term relief, given the huge inventory overhang in the new home market,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders reported that its survey of builder sentiment sank in June to the lowest level in 16 years, a reading of 28, down from 30 in May. It was the lowest showing since February 1991, a period that covered the last major housing recession.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The tightening in lending standards is having quite an impact,'' said David F. Seiders, chief economist for the home builders. Mr. Seiders said that he looked for construction of new homes and apartments to decline by 22 percent this year after having fallen by 13 percent in 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, construction activity fell by 19.7 percent in the West and 1.6 percent in the South. Construction was up 15.7 percent in the Northeast and 15.5 percent in the Midwest.   </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">When Does A Housing Slump Become A Bust?   </span>
</div><div class="author">By ANNA BERNASEK   </div><div>1100 words</div><div>17 June 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANY Americans fear the consequences of a housing bust, but few know what one would really look like.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think about it for a moment. How far do housing prices have to fall before a slump becomes a bust? In the stock market, we have a pretty good idea what a crash is. Among stock market experts, there is a consensus that a 10 percent decline in a major index is a correction while a 20 percent decline is more significant: a crash or a bear market, depending on the time involved. For the macro economy, there is also agreed-upon terminology. For example, a recession means two consecutive quarters of declining gross domestic product.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when it comes to declines in housing prices, there is no such framework. As experts debate whether we're headed for a housing bust, you'd think that we should at least be able to define it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that economists haven't agreed on a definition. In part, that's because severe declines in housing prices tend to be rare events, not a common subject for discussion. The last really big decline in national housing prices occurred more than 70 years ago, during the Great Depression. Another reason is that the data measuring the housing market is far more opaque than that for the stock market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let's work with the data we have. Start with the worst housing market on record. During the 1930s, housing prices fell sharply across the nation. According to the S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller home price index, a measure of national housing prices, the average price of a home fell 24 percent from 1929 to 1933.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, there have been severe price declines in regional markets. The most severe was in the so-called oil patch during the 1980s. In the late 1970s, as global oil prices soared, oil-producing areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Colorado, Wyoming and Alaska experienced an economic boom. As oil prices collapsed in the early 1980s, those economies crashed, and housing along with them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the worst cases, nominal home prices fell 40 percent in Lafayette, La., and 33 percent in Casper, Wyo., from 1983 to 1988, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. In Houston, prices fell 22 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there were the sharp price declines in housing on both coasts during the early 1990s. At that time, a series of events including the recession of 1990-91, the military downsizing after the cold war and a commercial real estate collapse led to a housing downturn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, in Los Angeles, Long Beach and Santa Ana areas of California, the average price of a home tumbled 19 percent from 1993 to 1998, while on the other side of the country, in the Hartford area, the average home price dropped 17 percent over the same period, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two economists with the  <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, Cynthia Angell and Norman Williams, have studied housing cycles since 1978 and have come up with a definition of a housing bust. In a paper published in February 2005, they called it a decline of at least 15 percent in nominal prices, meaning not adjusted for inflation. While economists tend to focus on real prices over time, the authors argue that in housing, nominal prices are a better measure of distress because homeowners, rarely think in inflation-adjusted terms in assessing market conditions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economists, however, argue that 15 percent may be too restrictive a definition. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com, says a better one would be a decline of 10 percent or more from peak to trough. ''When you see a decline in home prices of 10 percent, you get significant credit problems and it's enough to wipe out equity in most cases,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi also said that once prices have dropped 10 percent, there tends to be a self-reinforcing downward cycle. If borrowers can't afford their mortgages and banks foreclose, their homes are generally sold at significant discounts to the market. That creates an added drag on overall prices, resulting in greater numbers of foreclosures, followed by even greater price slides.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason Mr. Zandi argues for 10 percent is the tendency of housing-price measurements to underestimate declines. Sellers often provide discounts that may not show up in the measured price, but are still significant. Today, some homebuilders are discounting the sales price of new homes by an average of 5 percent, Mr. Zandi said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how far have prices actually fallen? The median price of an existing home has declined 4 percent, on average, since the peak in October 2005, according to the National Association of Realtors. Yet in some areas, by Mr. Zandi's definition, at least, the market is already experiencing a bust.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12 months that ended in March, for example, the median price of an existing single-family home in the Sarasota-Bradenton- Venice area of Florida fell by 12.4 percent, according to the National Association of Realtors. In Louisiana, in the area of New Orleans, Metairie and Kenner, the average price fell by 11 percent. And in the Reno-Sparks area of Nevada, the average decline was 8.8 percent, not far from Mr. Zandi's threshold.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, Mr. Zandi points out that 40 percent of metropolitan areas around the country are now experiencing declines in housing prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT would a definition of a housing bust tell us? First, it would help explain why, despite all the focus on the possibility of a bust, many people may feel that the housing market really isn't all that bad right now. On average, and based on national surveys, price declines haven't been that severe.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the pessimists are right that there's more to come, look out. A 10 percent decline in prices is likely to feel pretty awful. And then everyone might agree on what a housing bust is.   </p>
