<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders sold new homes at a faster rate last month than they did in October, shrinking the backlog of unsold homes on the market, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many economists said the report, rather than foreshadowing a quick rebound, highlighted how fragile residential construction remained and suggested that the downturn now rattling the housing market had not yet run its course.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed that sales of new single-family homes rose 3.4 percent in November, seasonally adjusted, to an annual rate of 1.05 million. That followed a 3.8 percent decline in October.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news helped propel stocks on Wall Street to another record high -- its 22nd so far this year -- with the Dow Jones industrial average rising more than 100 points to finish the day above 12,500 for the first time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a session typical of the often-buoyant final trading days of the year in which stocks gain on light volume as investors seek to polish their portfolios. [Page C13.]  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of homebuilders like Pulte Homes, Toll Brothers and Lennar all gained more than 1.5 percent as investors interpreted the home sales numbers as a sign that the slowdown in the housing market may have bottomed out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists typically do not use November figures to make generalizations about trends in the housing market because the month is shortened by the Thanksgiving holiday. In fact, when the numbers are not seasonally adjusted, the number of new homes sold in November -- 72,000 -- was the lowest in almost four years. Inventories, a 7.7-month supply unadjusted, were the highest since December 1995.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a relatively large adjustment factor here,'' said Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders. ''I wouldn't read too much into those numbers.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance, many numbers in the report seemed to hint at a recovery in new-home sales. The median price of a new home in November rose, for example, and sales in the Northeast, Midwest and West all grew by double digits for the month. Beyond the numbers for November, however, few signs in the report pointed toward a reversal of the overall downward trajectory in residential housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the November advance, sales of new homes are off 15.3 percent compared with a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Although the rebound in sales is consistent with the housing slowdown bottoming out, it seems too early to rejoice,'' said Dimitry Fleming, an economist with ING Financial Markets. ''Supply is still high.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists do not expect the market to stabilize until mid-2007.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the statistics are adjusted for seasonal variations, the backlog of unsold new homes on the market declined to a 6.3-month supply in November, down from a 6.7-month supply in October. But that is still far higher than November 2005, when there was a 4.9-month supply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a home rose 5.8 percent from November 2005, to $251,700. But economists said the increase was most likely the result of a rise in sales for the month in the Northeast and the West, where homes are more expensive. In November, sales in the Northeast climbed 22.5 percent compared with October, while the West saw a 19 percent jump.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales data from the last year, however, is more sobering. The Northeast was hit particularly hard; sales fell 42.4 percent from a year ago. Sales in the South declined 19.2 percent, and they fell 9 percent in the West. In the Midwest, however, sales rose 1.2 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the rise in the national median price, economists said the jump in sales during November suggested that buyers were still enjoying a market tilted to their advantage. Builders continue to offer incentives like upgraded kitchen appliances, landscaping and mortgage points at no additional charge. Incentives are not reflected in home price data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julia Coronado, chief United States economist with Barclays Capital, said buyers were still shopping in a market that was highly favorable to them. ''We do know that it's more of a buyer's market, and builders are not eager to sit around with excess inventory on their books. It's extremely expensive to do that, so they move it quickly.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter E. Kretzmer, senior economist with the Bank of America, said, ''Despite a monthly rise in the median new home price in November, prices remain on a flattening trend.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the housing market has been in the midst of a sharp slowdown in recent months -- some economists are calling it a full-blown housing recession -- the damage to the broader economy has been limited so far. The decline in residential construction during the summer months knocked more than a full percentage point off the nation's gross domestic product growth, pulling it down to 2 percent in the third quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But strength in other areas of the economy -- consumer spending and commercial construction, for example -- has helped to keep growth from stalling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign of distress in housing, the Mortgage Bankers Association said yesterday that its index of applications to buy a home or refinance a loan dropped to the lowest level in four months.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are likely to decline again next year, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes are expected to decline 8.6 percent, to 6.47 million, for 2006, and shrink another 1 percent, to 6.40 million units, next year. Sales of new homes should fall a sharp 17.7 percent this year and another 9.4 percent next year, the association said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the housing sector should see a rebound by the end of next year, said David A. Lereah, the association's chief economist.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By the fourth quarter of 2007, existing-home sales will be 4.6 percent higher than the current quarter,'' Mr. Lereah said, adding that about three-quarters of the country will see a sluggish expansion of existing-home sales next year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last three months of 2005, homes were appreciating at a 12 percent rate, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. From July to September this year, home price appreciation had slowed to a 3.5 percent rate.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following are excerpts of reader responses to David Leonhardt's Dec. 6 column on falling home prices:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re: the auction in Naples, Fl., that you described. Most of the properties that were auctioned had been purchased between Oct. 2004 and Nov. 2005. Most of the them are owned by one individual who decided to unload all of her properties. This was no way to paint a nice picture of Naples.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Wendi L. Darragh  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I agree that the auction was not a pure test of the Naples housing market. As I wrote, it "may have exaggerated the downturn in the market." But the 25 percent decline at the auction still seems a lot closer to reality than the government numbers showing a 20 percent price increase in Naples between the summers of 2005 and 2006. Tom Doyle, a Naples real estate agent, estimates that a typical Naples house, sold in the normal way, would go for about 20 percent less than it did the previous fall. Mr. Doyle's report is available here.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- David Leonhardt  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have a broker's license in Florida, and I can guarantee you that prices in Miami are flat at best, probably falling, and certainly not up 22% over last year, as the government data shows. Monthly data from the Florida Association of Realtors (go to  www.far.org [http://www.far.org] and see the monthly releases with county-specific data) show a peak in prices last November, stagnation since, and some indication that prices are starting to decline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Thomas K. Landry  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I worked in residential and commercial real estate sales both in New York City and in northern New Jersey from 1981 to 1992 and have followed the real estate markets locally and nationally ever since.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have to say that I find much of the current panic talk about residential real estate in our print press very puzzling. Real estate is, over time, an appreciating, and even income earning, asset, which almost never turns into something worthless, nothing more than a piece of paper, as a stock or a bond can.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Louis B. Massano  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is time to get back to basics on housing. A home should be a stable place to live, not a way for someone to get rich quick.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our neighborhood in Maryland has small yards, small houses with porches and big trees. Many of the houses were built in the 1920s and 1930s. It has been a precious middle-class neighborhood. People sit on porches, chat on sidewalks, care for each others pets, and feed wild birds. A few blocks away lies the Falkland Apartments, built in the 1930s as decent housing for working people. They are about 4 stories tall, and have lovely trees on the grounds. Near them is the a group of townhouses. They are small, and get lots of light.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our neighborhood seems to have a stable population. Households with more than two children are balanced by those like ours which have none, or those with one child. Why is population growth a taboo topic?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Nancy Nickell  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You wrote: "For many homeowners, of course, the decline doesn't much matter. They didn't really benefit from the run-up, and they won't suffer from the decline. And for any renters hoping to buy a home, the fall in prices is downright good news."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't forget people like us who are now subjected to 100% assessment, reassessed every year. Our property taxes have skyrocketed in the past few years, as housing prices boomed, and assessments reflected that. Do you think that a reassessment in the downward direction will happen as readily? I doubt it! We'll be paying taxes on over-assessed values for years to come.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Ellen Sicignano  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the owner of 3 properties on Palmer Ranch in Sarasota, I am seeing those same decreases. The list prices at The Isles on Palmer Ranch, where we bought a townhouse in March, at the top of the cycle, have recently been cut 20 percent. However, it is still a great area, and with something like 1,000 people a day moving to Florida, the current oversupply should be taken up fairly quickly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Howard R. Schneider  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would add these facts for you. In Washington D.C., in the condominium where we lived there for 15 years, the prices were stable for a two bedroom Condominium at about $80,000. Between 2000 and 2005, the same unit went up in price to $325,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have not looked to what the decline is, but can guess the two bedroom units are not selling at $325,000 any more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Thomas G. Schongalla  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They amount of disinformation being put out by the realtors here in Florida is astounding, the truth is hard to find. Your article reinforces what I have been thinking all along.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Kevin Griggs  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all the discussion of the have/have nots and the massive widening wealth disparity in this country, why doesn't anyone do a study on real estate valuations in wealthy areas versus other areas. In Greenwich, Nantucket, Palm Beach, Aspen, etc., prices continue to climb, as do real estate sales. To lump all real estate into one bucket is not necessarily a great survey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Scott Hague  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't understand why the government is not being criticized and held up to the light more as they are the ones that allowed all the " exotic loans that have proliferated in the last five years or so. Some lawyer must have come up with the exotic term as it clearly was utilized as a deceitful and hopelessly optimistic borrowing vehicle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Mark G. Comerford  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am not at all surprised that real estate prices have fallen ten to twenty percent this year as shown in your article. After all we had a real boom in real estate in 04 and 05 with prices going out of sight. The definition of a boom is a temporary increase in the price of assets, and the commanding word is "temporary", that why it's called a boom. Booms are not supposed to last. If they were expected to be the norm in the future they would not be described as a boom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Sol Gordon  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I agree with your suggestion that things are a bit worse than reported by some. Have you looked at the housing market in Sarasota and environs? I was there in the Spring of 2005 and there were large Condo complexes sprouting everywhere, some with a thousand units (!), costing $650,000 and up, I was told. I couldn't believe that the market could absorb them all.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Toby Huff  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You write: "For many homeowners, of course, the decline doesn't much matter."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have just had you property assessment raised after home values escalated, then you are now stuck with a home being taxed at a higher value than it is worth. I know that rising assessments do not always mean higher property taxes. But if you are one of the unlucky ones that lives in a piece of property or in a particular section of town that society now covets, then more than likely your assessment and taxes have gone way up. For us here in upstate N.Y., that can mean losing our homes and sometimes moving out of N.Y. State.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Bill Hecht  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You should see Reno. A year ago, you could not get a 4 BR/2 BA for less than $500K. A friend just bought a newly built one for $315,000. Existing homeownerss are in a state of denial. The house I rent is now below its 2001 value. The supply of new homes is exploding and the buyers are nowhere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past summer there were 27 homes for sale in my subdivision. Two sold and most are now off the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Eric Snyder  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No spin, good job. I am a national valuation person who travels the U.S. and sees a much different situation from what is told.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Richard Gilmore  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your article on housing prices was particularly meaningful for me because I was invited to be a blogger for the Arizona Republic (here in Phoenix). The blog went live this past Monday, and my first blog was on the same point.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Gene Cohen  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cohen's conclusion: ''The bad news: Median housing prices likely are understating the severity of the housing slump. The good news: The Fed likely is not looking at median housing prices in assessing the severity of the housing slump.'' You can read his entire post here.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I made two mistakes last week when describing a real estate auction in Naples, Fla. First, I used the word ''bidders'' to describe the roughly 500 people at the auction. Not all of them placed a bid, though, so ''audience members'' would have been a better description.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, I described the houses at the auction as having been sold. But the auction rules gave the homeowners the right to reject the winning bids and hold onto their properties. The owner and bank lenders haven't made final decisions on the four properties mentioned in the column and the graphic, according to Paul Drake, who helped run the auction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the bids are rejected, it will make the auction an excellent microcosm of the real estate market right now. From California to the Northeast, many sellers are refusing to accept the offers they have received -- which are, by definition, the current market values of the homes -- and the number of home sales has plummeted. That's the main reason the official statistics on house prices are so misleading.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Wed Dec 13 2006   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down in Naples, Fla., a fast-growing city on the Gulf of Mexico, there was an auction of houses about a month ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An auction isn't the usual way to sell a home, but it can make sense for people who don't want to leave their houses on the market for months at a time and also don't want to take the first offer to come along. So on a Saturday morning inside the Naples Beach Hotel and Golf Club, a few dozen houses went on the block in front of about 500 bidders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the official housing statistics, you might have guessed that the sellers would have made out just fine, despite all the talk of a real estate slump. According to one widely followed real estate index -- tabulated by the government agency that regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- the average house in Naples sold for 20 percent more this summer than it would have a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that wasn't what happened at the auction. In fact, if you were at the beach club that Saturday, you could have been excused for thinking that the real estate market was crashing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One three-bedroom ranch house with a pool sold for $671,000. In 2005, the same house sold for $809,000. Another house, just steps from Naples Bay, sold for $880,000 at the auction., compared with $1.35 million a year earlier. On average, the houses that changed hands at the auction had fallen about 25 percent in value since 2005, according to Thomas Lawler, a real estate consultant who analyzed the auction's results.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Naples is not a typical housing market. House prices nearly tripled in the first half of this decade, and speculators, who are more likely than residents to sell a house in a panic, flooded into the area in recent years. But with that said, Naples is not as unusual as you may think.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that the official numbers on house prices -- the last refuge of soothing information about the real estate market on the coasts -- are deeply misleading. Depending on which set you look at, you'll see that prices have either continued to rise, albeit modestly, or have fallen slightly over the last year. But the statistics have a number of flaws, perhaps the biggest being that they are based only on homes that have actually sold. The numbers overlook all those homes that have been languishing on the market for months, getting only offers that their owners have not been willing to accept.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reality, homes across much of Florida, California and the Northeast are worth a lot less than they were a year ago. The auction in Naples may have exaggerated the downturn in the market there, but not by much. Tom Doyle, a Naples real estate agent, estimated that a typical house there, sold in the normal way, would go for about 20 percent less than it did the previous fall.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Boston area, prices have fallen about 10 to 15 percent since the middle of 2005, estimated Chobee Hoy, who owns a real estate brokerage firm in Brookline. Jerome J. Manning, who runs the Massachusetts-based auction company that conducted the Naples sale, told me he thought that values had dropped about 20 percent around Boston. (The government, meanwhile, says the average price rose 1 percent from last summer to this summer. But here's all you need to know about how well the government tracks the Boston market: the index excludes any mortgage larger than $417,000.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September of last year, Ms. Hoy sold a one-bedroom condominium in Brookline for $395,000. She recently sold another apartment of the same size in the same building for $300,000. Since March, her firm has been listing a house in the Fisher Hill neighborhood of Brookline that cost $995,000 when it last sold, in the summer of 2004. Ms. Hoy expects it to sell this time for less than $900,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market in northern Virginia is similar: prices are down 10 to 15 percent, according to an analysis by Mr. Lawler, a former Fannie Mae executive who's based there. In Portland, Me., the typical house has lost about 10 percent of its value in the last year and a half, said Bill Trask, the former head of the local Realtors' board.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, where co-op boards generally bar the door to absentee speculators and creative mortgages, prices seem to have slid a bit in the last few months, but only to roughly their 2005 levels. In the New York suburbs, though, values have fallen perhaps 10 percent or more since last year. Prices also appear to be down in Sacramento and San Diego.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many homeowners, of course, the decline doesn't much matter. They didn't really benefit from the run-up, and they won't suffer from the decline. And for any renters hoping to buy a home, the fall in prices is downright good news.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, there are also a lot of families that took on huge mortgage debts based on the ephemeral peak values of their properties. In effect, they cashed in on the housing boom without cashing out. As Ed Smith Jr., the chief executive of Plaza Financial Group, a mortgage brokerage firm near San Diego, said, ''So many people picked up their homes, turned them upside down and shook them like a piggy bank.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The withdrawals have been so big that the average household in Boston now has slightly less equity in its home than it did in 2000, according to an analysis by Moody's Economy.com that took inflation into account. And that analysis used the house prices reported by the National Association of Realtors, which appear to be more accurate than the government's data right now but are still too rosy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the people who bought their homes in the last couple of years and made almost no down payment. Many of them may now be underwater, owing more on their mortgages than their houses are worth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most worrisome, growing numbers of these families are falling behind on their mortgage payments, and they won't be able to bail themselves out by refinancing or selling their homes. ''We're now going to combine a high amount of debt with falling home values,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the broader economy, this may turn out to be just a hiccup. Big piles of debt can often look scarier than they really are. Then again, the housing slump of 2006 may also be the start of something larger. Mr. Zandi considers it to be ''the most significant threat to the global expansion.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last few decades, the world's financial system has endured a crisis roughly once every three or four years. There was the stock market crash of 1987, the Asian and Mexican meltdowns in the 1990s, the dot-com implosion of 2000 and, most recently, the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001. We may now be living on both borrowed money and borrowed time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart/Photos: ''Falling Prices''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Naples, Fla., prices paid at a recent auction of homes suggest that the true value of real estate in the area has fallen a lot more than government statistics reflect.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broadest government measure of house prices is calculated by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, the agency that oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The idea at the heart of the index is a good one. It tries to do the same sort of apples-to-apples analysis I described in this week's column, tracking individual houses over time to see how much their price has changed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has three big weaknesses that end up making it much less useful than it could be. First, it excludes any mortgage over $417,000, because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- the two big mortgage buyers -- don't own loans so large. Obviously, many mortgages on the coasts are bigger than that.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, the data for individual metropolitan areas includes not just house sales but also appraisals done for a mortgage refinancing. Appraisal values, as many people know, tend to be inflated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally -- and by necessity -- the index includes only houses that have actually sold lately. In a falling market, with an enormous number of properties for sale, the houses that are selling tend to be more appealing than the average house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're dependent on houses that are actually transacting," said Patrick Lawler, the chief economist at the oversight agency, which is known as Ofheo. "It's true that may not evenly reflect the market."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, all these flaws seem to be making house values look much stronger than they really are. According to the latest index, for example, the average house in Miami would have sold for 22 percent more this summer than a year earlier. You won't find many house sellers in Miami who would agree that's true.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Thomas Lawler, a housing economist (and no relation to Patrick Lawler), recently wrote in a report to clients, "Well, there's a growing view that this index...doesn't reflect what's really going on with home prices."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawler of Ofheo disputes that. He acknowledges that the index has fewer high-priced houses than the market as a whole but says that it still picks up many expensive homes, because they often have mortgages worth much less than the house's value. He also pointed out that the Ofheo data covers only single-family homes, not condominiums (which in many markets are doing worse than houses).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, Mr. Lawler says that the Ofheo index is based on an enormous amount of data that is more accurate than any individual perceptions of a local real-estate market. "The indexes," he said, referring to Ofheo's measure and others, "all do a good job of measuring what they're designed for."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My sense, though, is that the blind spots in the Ofheo index are big enough to make a real difference. In fact, the index now appears to be less accurate than the numbers reported by the National Association of Realtors, which are actually calculated in a less sophisticated way.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors don't track individual houses over time. They simply look at the houses that happened to sell during a given quarter and calculate their median price. So these numbers are even more strongly influenced by the mix of homes being sold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a group of mansions is suddenly built in a city, they will artificially make all house prices there appear to be rising. Or if the houses that are sold one quarter have lost less of their value than the typical house, which seems to be happening now, the Realtors' data will make house prices look healthier than they truly are. Yet despite this bias, the price drop in some markets has become big enough that even the Realtors have been reporting small declines in south Florida, Boston, Washington and parts of California, among other places.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, there is no easy fix to some of these problems. Robert Shiller, a Yale economist who has been a pioneer in developing house-price indexes, agrees that the mix of houses being sold can affect the numbers. "When the market drops, people who bought near the peak are slower to sell than people who bought when prices were lower than they are today," Mr. Shiller wrote in an e-mail. "This means that some sales do not occur because people are holding out, and in this sense the indices are biased."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not clear what economists can do about this bias. They can't measure sales that aren't happening. They can't, in other words, tell you what your house would sell for if you decided you had to sell it this month. In their own index -- which are also offering a pretty rosy view -- Mr. Shiller and his colleagues have opted not to adjust their numbers, since any corrections "would be ad-hoc corrections that would not be objective."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For homeowners, the lesson is not to take any of these statistics too personally. The long housing boom has caused a lot of Americans to think of housing much as they think of stocks -- as an investment whose value can be tracked almost in real time. But there is no equivalent of the Standard &amp; Poor 500 Index for real estate. Just because the government's measure shows a 10 percent increase in your area's home prices doesn't mean that your house is 10 percent more valuable than it was a year ago. It might, in truth, be less valuable than it was a year ago.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose in the third quarter at their slowest pace since 1998, and were essentially flat when adjusted for inflation, according to a government price index released yesterday. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data suggest that prices, especially for the existing single-family homes that the index focuses on, continue to weaken across much of the country and particularly in formerly hot coastal markets. Nationally, prices rose 0.86 percent from the second quarter and 7.73 percent from the third quarter of 2005. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices fell in five states, including New York and Massachusetts, and in 15 of California's 25 metropolitan areas, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight reported. Nationally, prices declined for the third quarter in 92 of 379 metropolitan areas, up from 87 in the second quarter. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a pretty clear evidence -- if anyone was confused about it -- that prices have decelerated in most parts of the country,'' said Patrick J. Lawler, chief economist for the agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the large mortgage buyers. ''But we are not looking at a bubble bursting across the country.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest declines were seen in cities in the Midwest, where manufacturers have been laying off workers. Among states, prices fell 0.52 percent in Michigan and in four Northeast states -- New York (0.33 percent), Massachusetts (0.49 percent), New Hampshire (0.14 percent) and Rhode Island (0.37 percent). </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, several pockets of strong growth remained. Five Western states -- Idaho, Utah, Oregon, Arizona and Washington -- had the biggest price increases, ranging from 1 percent to 4.7 percent. And on the Gulf Coast, a shortage of housing and the slow pace of rebuilding sent home prices soaring in markets that were affected by Hurricane Katrina. Prices rose 15.8 percent from a year earlier in New Orleans, 23.3 percent in Gulfport-Biloxi, Miss., and 17.5 percent in Mobile, Ala. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike data collected by the National Association of Realtors, which have shown declines in the median price of homes sold in the last three months, the federal housing office's index is still rising. That difference is a result of the way the government compiles its index, housing specialists say. It measures repeat sales of the same houses over time, while the Realtors report median prices of houses sold in a period. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a large number of modest homes are sold in a given month relative to a year earlier, the Realtors data will indicate that prices have fallen, even if the price on any specific property has not changed appreciably. Also, the government index does not include condominiums, and condo sales and prices have fallen far faster than those of single-family homes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken together, the two data series suggest that moderately priced single-family homes are doing better than more expensive properties, said S. Lawrence Yun, a senior economist at the Realtors association. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawler said an adjustment in home prices should come as no surprise given that prices rose 55 percent nationally in the last five years, with some hotter markets posting even bigger gains. He noted that, adjusting for inflation, prices fell in the early 1980s and the early 1990s after periods of strong gains. What is surprising about the recent flattening in prices, however, is that it has not been prompted by economic weakness and job losses, as was the case in those previous periods. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This market has been unusual over the past few years because we had a recession'' earlier in the decade, Mr. Lawler said, ''and the market didn't weaken, and now the housing market is weakening and we don't have a recession.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakness in housing appears to be more muted and gradual than many had predicted. The recent decline in long-term interest has provided critical support to the housing market, Mr. Lawler said. Nationally, the average 30-year fixed mortgage carried an interest rate of 6.14 percent this week, down from 6.76 percent in July and roughly where it was in January, according to Freddie Mac. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National and local data on home prices may not reflect reality as lived by people trying to buy or sell homes, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. Housing reports are based on transactions, and because many sellers are reluctant to cut prices and buyers are waiting for prices to fall further, the number of homes being sold has fallen significantly.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''In the Region'' article in some copies last Sunday about residential sales trends in Westchester County misstated the professional affiliation of Debbie Doern, one of the real estate experts interviewed. She is manager of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage, not Century 21 Residential Brokerage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Nov 26 2006   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF Tip O'Neill had sold houses for a living, he might have declared that all real estate is local. That seems particularly true when the market is struggling. In some parts of Westchester, the market is clearly in a downturn, if not a full-blown real estate recession, and yet other locales seem relatively untouched.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most towns, villages and cities, real estate agents report flagging sales and increasingly frustrated sellers. Homes are staying on the market longer, inventory is building and buyers are biding their time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, most brokers are exhorting sellers ''to get real,'' said Sona Davidian, a broker-owner at C. S. McClellan Real Estate in Pelham. That means cutting prices to reflect the market changes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or as Diana Hellman, a sales agent with Merritt Associates in Larchmont, explained it: ''If a property is priced right, it will sell. It just may not sell for as much as one hoped for.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the county as a whole, the number of sales of existing homes dropped 17 percent in the third quarter of this year from the corresponding quarter a year ago -- to 2,718 units from 3,278, according to figures from the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, the median sales price of a single-family home was higher than a year earlier, although barely, at $716,000, compared with $711,700 in the third quarter of 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one place that seems to be holding up better than most is Larchmont. There, the number of sales for the first 10 months so far this year has exceeded the corresponding period in 2005, with 157 sales this year, up from 147 a year earlier, said Debbie Doern, manager of Century 21 Residential Brokerage. In addition, the median sales price during the period was slightly more than $1.1 million, up from $999,000 a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hellman at Merritt Associates attributed the village's relative resistance to a distinctive combination of assets: an architecturally varied and well-maintained housing stock from the 1920s and 1930s; a thriving downtown within walking distance of almost anywhere else in the village; a location next to Long Island Sound; and proximity to Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farther north, on the Village Green in Bedford, Missy Renwick, the broker-owner of Renwick &amp; Winterling, a family-owned real estate agency, reported that some towns -- among them Pound Ridge, Armonk and Bedford -- have so far remained relatively unscathed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Gosh, everybody is saying the market is awful,'' Ms. Renwick said, ''but we just had the best October in a long time, with a $17 million sale, two $7 million sales and some for $5 million. At worst, we have a few low bidders out there looking at the leftovers.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one segment of Westchester's market, that of new luxury condominium sales, the sales picture has been downright rosy. As Louis R. Cappelli, a Valhalla-based developer, observed, referring to condos he is building, ''there may be a slowdown in some locations, but we're certainly not seeing it in White Plains and New Rochelle.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the sales center opened last month, Mr. Cappelli said, contracts have been signed for more than a third of the units at his 44-story Residences at the Ritz-Carlton in White Plains -- where prices range from $750,000 to more than $6 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Trump Plaza in New Rochelle, which Mr. Cappelli is building in partnership with Donald J. Trump, more than 50 percent of the condos have sold since the spring, he said. The units there range from $500,000 for a one-bedroom to $1.4 million for a three-bedroom penthouse.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for new construction of single-family homes, there are few large tracts of land left in the county for major building projects. But at smaller in-fill projects, like the new town houses for sale on the south side of New Rochelle on Pelham Avenue near the Long Island Sound, none of the 10 units at AnnMar Gardens have sold since they went on the market early in the summer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rose Bulfamante, an agent for Century 21 Mancuso, said that because of the slow market, the developer was considering dropping the asking prices -- $779,000 to $849,000 -- on the three-bedroom units and offering the incentive of a year's membership at a local beach club.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bronxville, a fashionable village with a quaint downtown and a well-maintained housing stock, prices generally tend to be higher than in neighboring communities. But sales there have been slow in recent months, and houses are staying on the market for relatively long periods, said Leah Caro, broker-owner of Bronxville-Ley Real Estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even a community like Bronxville doesn't exist in a vacuum when it comes to this market,'' she said. ''Some places may be more insulated than others, but only a rare few are altogether immune.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways, Bronxville might be expected to attract to the same kind of people who are drawn to Larchmont. Ms. Caro speculated that potential buyers in Bronxville might be holding off until a villagewide revaluation of property is completed this winter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for homeowners, they have seen the breathtaking prices that their neighbors' houses fetched last year, and they want the same. But like Sean and Lynn Leary, whose vintage 1920s colonial in Pelham Manor has been on the market since July, many have had to adjust their sights.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Learys' house came on the market for $1.289 million and sat without offers throughout the summer and early fall. The couple have since lowered the asking price to $1.199 million, and Mr. Leary has torn down the original two-gar garage, which was in poor condition, and is building a new one in its place.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people say it's an ego thing with sellers not wanting to accept lower offers,'' said Mr. Leary, a commercial real estate broker, ''but that's not really the case, at least with us. It's more about sellers like us who are just trying to understand what's happening. Sometimes, it feels like we're trying to catch a falling knife. We're trying to anticipate what's going to happen next.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the offices of the Westchester County Board of Realtors in White Plains, P. Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive, offered a general overview of the market. ''It's pretty clear to me that nationally we're seeing a pullback in the real estate market,'' he said. ''In some places, it's truly a burst bubble; in other places, like in Westchester and Putnam, it's more like a correction.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, Westchester has fared better than many other places in the nation because there has not been the overbuilding in the new home market here that there has been elsewhere, Mr. Mercurio said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And Westchester hasn't been a market driven by speculators,'' he said. ''What we had was a feverish market with very high prices, and we were due for some relief.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mercurio noted that unless a seller acquired a home last year, when prices were at an all-time high in the county, and had to sell this year, most homeowners are still sitting on profits, pricing pressure notwithstanding. ''They're not going to be hurt,'' he said, ''although they may not get as much as they hoped for.''  </p>

</div><div class="author">By JEREMY W. PETERS  </div><div>811 words</div><div>18 November 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders pulled back from an uninviting market last month, slowing the pace of residential construction even more than in recent months, to the lowest level in six years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest housing statistics, released yesterday by the Commerce Department, suggested that the months ahead would be equally bleak. The number of building permits issued in October fell for the ninth straight month, dipping to the lowest rate since 1997.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report deepened concerns that the slowdown in the housing market could brake economic growth more than analysts have anticipated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new homes that builders started in October was down 14.6 percent from September, at seasonally adjusted annual rates, to 1.49 million. The number of building permits issued fell 6.3 percent, to 1.54 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's report shows a stark contrast from a year ago, when the housing market was still roaring. New residential construction has now plummeted by 27.4 percent from October last year. New building permits fell 28 percent over the same span.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only region of the country not to show considerable weakness last month was the Northeast, where the construction of apartments in New York and New Jersey helped cause a 31 percent jump in residential building for the month. Everywhere else saw a decline: the West, 2.1 percent; the Midwest, 11.7 percent; and the South, 26.4 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists disagree about whether home construction, sales and prices can fall much further, but some said yesterday that the new numbers suggested that the market was a long way from seeing any growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only way builders appear to be able to stimulate demand and shift unsold inventory is by practically giving these newly built homes away,'' Capital Economics, a research firm in London, wrote in a note to investors. ''No wonder they now seem very reluctant to start building more homes.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its latest survey, the National Association of Home Builders reported that builders were cutting prices with greater urgency than they were a year ago. In October, 28 percent of builders surveyed said they had lowered their prices by 5 to 10 percent, and another 8 percent said they had cut prices by more than 10 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, in its September 2005 survey, the association reported that only 3 percent of builders in the country were discounting their homes by more than 5 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharpest decline in construction activity last month was in single-family houses rather than multifamily units and apartments. Economists said that was particularly alarming, because single-family houses are by far the biggest component of residential building. The number of single-family home starts was 31.8 percent lower in October than a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Certainly this looks very much like a recessionary type of adjustment for this sector,'' said Brian A. Bethune, a United States economist with the research firm Global Insight. ''This data does not suggest that we're going to dodge a bullet. It does look severe.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some economists, the data pointed to even slower growth in the months ahead. Ethan Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers, revised his prediction for fourth quarter gross domestic product to 2.5 percent from 2.8 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of United States government bonds posted their biggest gains yesterday in nearly three weeks, a sign that bond investors believe the economy will continue to slow. In a day of up and down trading, the stock market shrugged off the signs of a deepening slowdown in housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With other areas of the economy holding up -- the job market is relatively healthy, consumer spending continues to rise and gasoline prices have fallen -- many economists are hopeful that the effects of a sagging housing market will be contained.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Outside of housing, the economy looks quite good,'' said Marisa DiNatale, an economist with Moody's Economy.com. ''So we think the economy is going to weather this.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said that in one sense, the decline in building activity last month showed that builders were getting the message and setting themselves up for a quicker recovery. Peter E. Kretzmer, senior economist with Bank of America, said the deceleration last month could be a ''silver lining'' that would help builders sell off the huge backlog of unsold new homes.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SIGNS of the times for the residential real estate market in New Jersey seem these days to point in two directions -- or more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Christopher Court in Montclair, asking prices for 10 new 5,000-square-foot homes with elevators, set at $1.7 million last spring, have just been reduced by as much as $400,000, to ''accommodate market conditions,'' the builders say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet an older Tudor on nearby Park Street with an in-ground pool went on the market in September for $1.65 million and sold within weeks for more than $2 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Hoboken, a developer of 76 one- and two-bedroom condominiums on Adams Street is seeking to snare buyers with a fat package of incentives, including a chance to win a paid two-year lease on a BMW, a down payment capped at $2,500, fully paid closing costs and no common charges for a year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet less than a mile away, at the Waldo Lofts in Jersey City, no buyer incentives are being offered on similar-sized units unveiled two weeks ago. Nine of the 41 available condos sold within four days.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Summit and Short Hills, where hyperexpensive homes traditionally sell like apple cider in autumn, the current pace of sales is slow -- very slow, real estate agents say. But not entirely, they hasten to add, and certainly not always.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It depends,'' said a Summit broker, Lois Schneider of Lois Schneider Realtor. ''It depends on the particular house, the street, whether the asking price is realistic, and -- I don't know -- maybe the way the wind is blowing that day.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for real estate professionals' attitudes these days, ''the press is talking more doom and gloom than we do,'' Ms. Schneider said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reached at a Florida real estate conference she was attending with her ''brain trust'' -- a group of seven agents and brokers from the Summit area -- Ms. Schneider said a definite trend this fall was for homes to sit on the market longer. Yet, she added, fall is always slower than summer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty Summit homes closed in September and October for which deals were struck during the spring and summer, Ms. Schneider noted. That was not far off the number for 2005, a boom year, with 43 early fall closings, she pointed out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, new statistics from the Otteau Group, which feeds data to brokers based on analysis of signed contracts, indicates an 18-month buildup of unsold homes priced at $1 million and above in Union County, Summit's home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's spotty, though,'' said Jeffrey G. Otteau, whose East Brunswick-based firm compiles the report and runs seminars for real estate agents on market conditions. ''It's kind of a sputtering effect. One engine will stall, and the other keeps going.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''We see the market in some segments is getting close to bottoming out, with recovery likely to begin within the next six months.'' Mr. Otteau said he expects the first markets to reach a turning point will be ''entry level'' low-priced homes and age-restricted housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, Mr. Otteau added, he predicts no further significant decline statewide in sales or prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Schneider said several homes for sale in Summit last month sold above asking price. One, a 1910 colonial at 73 Oak Ridge Avenue that had not been modernized in any way, came on the market on Oct. 10 for $1.585 million and sold for more than the asking price within a week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linda Grotenstein is an agent with Coldwell Banker in Montclair, where the market has been torrid in recent years, with bidding wars, sales for 50 percent over asking price, and many contracts signed after a single open house. She said attractive homes priced below $1 million were still likely to get multiple offers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was a house on Frederick Street -- five bedrooms, three baths -- on the market for $689,000 a few weeks ago,'' she said. ''It sold in the $700,000s after multiple bids.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was another house on Gordonhurst that was just on the market for $782,500, wood frame, all done up, really pretty. It sold right away, and I heard it went really high.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it appears that builders with new homes built on speculation have lost the most opportune moment, said Ms. Grotenstein, echoing agents working in other cooling markets. Besides the Christopher Court homes in Montclair, Ms. Grotenstein said, two other large new homes built on large lots off Valley Road have been for sale for about three months, at $1.8 million and $1.9 million, but those prices have not been reduced.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A grand new home on a lot off Park Street also hit the market three weeks ago priced at $2.9 million, the upper reaches for Montclair.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At two condominium developments still under construction, the Siena in downtown Montclair and the Reserve at Glen Ridge, various concessions and price reductions are being offered to buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In this market, if a house is not priced absolutely right, buyers try to lowball,'' said Perri K. Feldman of Keller Williams Realty, who specializes in communities set along New Jersey Transit's Midtown Direct train line to Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average time it now takes to sell a home in New Jersey is five months, Ms. Feldman said. ''If you want to sell quickly,'' she added, ''then you have to be utterly realistic about the market conditions today -- not yesterday, today.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month in Madison, she brokered a sale close to asking price after 35 days, she said, by persuading the sellers to set a ''clear eyed'' price: $582,500 for a colonial with three bedrooms and two baths.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not that easy to find the magic price point when things are changing all the time,'' Ms. Feldman said, ''but it's possible.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE macroeconomic data on housing has been grim in recent weeks. On Oct. 25, the National Association of Realtors reported that the price of existing homes fell in September by 2.2 percent from the year before. The next day, the Commerce Department reported that the median price of new homes sold in September fell a whopping 9.7 percent from September 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are national figures. But real estate, like politics, is said to be a local business. Any broker worth her salt can easily come up with reasons that the malaise currently gripping the national housing scene doesn't affect her particular local market -- because of its excellent public schools or the lack of supply or the easy commute it affords.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are the brokers right? Is housing a single national market or a collection of hundreds of small markets?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer, as one might expect economists to say, is both.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing is becoming more of a national market and an international market than in the past,'' said Robert J. Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale and author of ''Irrational Exuberance.'' While huge price increases have been confined to particular areas, like Las Vegas, Professor Shiller, a careful student of speculative activity, has noticed Vegas-like attitudes popping up among homeowners in places like Milwaukee. In this boom, he said, ''national attention has been drawn to the real estate market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An evolving credit culture has also helped forge a national housing market. ''Instead of getting mortgages from local banks, as they did 20 years ago, people all over the country get mortgages from capital markets,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. That means that access to credit and interest rates don't vary much across the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in many ways the market remains intensely local. Last month, Economy.com issued a report that examined the prospects for housing in 379 metropolitan markets. Over all, the consulting firm expects home prices to fall by a small increment in 2007. But there's wide variation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''About 100 of the 379 metro areas will experience some kind of measurable price decline, and they together make up about half the nation's housing stock,'' Mr. Zandi said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a map, areas most at risk for short-term pain look like a Democratic fund-raiser's view of the country: Northern and Southern California, the Northeast and most of Florida. Meanwhile, in the remaining 279 metropolitan areas constituting most of the rest of the housing stock, prices should remain flat or rise. It's a tale of two groups of cities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking further into the future, Economy.com also projects that a small minority of the nation's metro areas -- about 20 -- will experience a crash over the next several years. (Economy.com defines a crash as a double-digit percentage decline, from peak to trough.) Reno, Nev., is expected to fall 17.2 percent by the fourth quarter of 2008 from the fourth-quarter peak in 2005. But some markets are expected to hold up fairly well. Home prices in Portland, Ore., are expected to fall just 0.8 percent by 2009.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What accounts for the differences? Not all housing markets are created equal. Homes in some cities have appreciated much more than average during the last several decades, and might be expected to fare better in coming years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the places that a group of economists has dubbed ''Superstar Cities.'' These are coastal urban areas where a scarcity of land, local regulations that prevent rapid development, and a plethora of well-paying jobs in thriving industries (rich people) have combined to create fertile housing microclimates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they were stocks, they'd be high-priced growth stocks,'' said Todd Sinai, professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Professor Sinai co-authored a paper on Superstar Cities with two other professors, Joseph Gyourko of Wharton and Christopher Mayer of Columbia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking back to the period from 1950 to 2000, the economists found that in San Francisco, a Superstar City, housing prices grew at a real annual rate of 3.5 percent a year --more than twice the national average.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In less-glamorous burgs, where land is comparatively plentiful and high-income jobs have been scarcer, price advances have been muted. From 1950 to 2000, housing prices in Buffalo grew at 0.54 percent a year, for example.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the degree that New York, Boston and San Francisco maintain their appeal to high-earning workers and companies, they might be insulated from long-term declines in prices. Of course, past performance is no guide to future performance, and not all Superstar Cities are created equal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MACROMARKETS, a company founded by Professor Shiller, has introduced futures contracts on housing prices in 10 markets. The contracts, traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, allow investors and builders to hedge bets or make investments based on how they think housing will do in 10 cities, among them superstars like New York, Boston, San Francisco and San Diego.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Shiller cautions that the contracts aren't very liquid. But on Friday, the futures market predicted that by August 2007, housing prices in the Chicago area would fall by 5.4 percent. On the same day, investors were betting that housing prices in Las Vegas would fall by a larger margin -- 7.1 percent -- in the same time frame.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The predictions by Economy.com and the futures markets provide a more nuanced view of the national housing market than the monthly data released by the National Association of Realtors and the Commerce Department. But lately, the data has all been trending in the same negative direction, even for the Superstar Cities. Professor Shiller said, ''They're all sending roughly the same signal.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vagaries of the real estate market are hitting Westchester County, with prices stagnating, sales plummeting and inventory languishing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to third-quarter figures from the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, which compiles market data, house sales in Westchester fell by 20.5 percent in the third quarter, the largest decline for the third quarter in the 17 years the statistics have been kept. The median sales price of a home rose less than 1 percent, to $716,125, in the third quarter, and the price of condominiums declined 1.3 percent to $385,000. Total inventory at the end of the quarter was 7,326 units, 22 percent higher than during the same period last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report noted that inventory levels were not as high as the second quarter, an indication that the number of homes on the market was stabilizing in the 7,000 to 8,000 range.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a bit below where the market was after recovering from the real estate recession following the stock market crash in 1987, when the inventory exceeded more than 10,000 homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third-quarter figures rely heavily on real estate activity in March, April and May, a period when mortgage interest rates rose, gas prices were soaring and the stock market was in a lull, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report predicted that sales and prices would continue to decrease during the fourth quarter, with perhaps the first year-to-year decrease in median and mean sales prices of single-family homes since the 1990-91 recession.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no reason to feel negative aside from wild cards like recession and mortgage interest rates,'' said P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive for the Westchester County Board of Realtors. ''The fundamentals that drive a real estate market are in place in the county.'' He cited low unemployment, steady job growth, the limited number of employers leaving the area, improvement in the stock market and lower gasoline prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said that comments from real estate agents that sales were inconsistent during the summer suggested that the fourth quarter could be similar to the third.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If those comments had any significance, it means the report after this one will show a continuation, if not a deepening, of the correction,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wind Damage Limited, Relatively Speaking  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite heavy rain and winds gusting to about 50 miles per hour, last weekend's storm left Westchester relatively unscathed, particularly when compared to the Labor Day weekend damage caused by tropical storm Ernesto.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the more serious incidents, wind gusts capsized a sailboat that was midway between Westchester and Nassau Counties about 4 p.m. last Saturday leading to a search of longer than 40 minutes for a man who was swept away from the boat, said Capt. Ken Cavanagh of Sea Tow Service Harbor Marine, a towing and rescue service that was the first to arrive. The missing man and two other men who had been on the sailboat were rescued. Their names were not released.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He was lucky,'' Captain Cavanagh said. He said the men were floating in 58-degree water in three-to-five foot seas about two miles off the coast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The storm also caused numerous car accidents and downed wires, but no serious injuries or deaths were reported.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 8,500 Con Edison customers in Westchester lost power as the storm, which stretched from Maryland to Maine, moved through the area. By Sunday evening, power had been restored to all those customers, said Alfonso Quiroz, a spokesman for the utility.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the Ernesto storm, nearly 76,200 Westchester customers lost power, some for nearly a week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent storm was less severe, Mr. Quiroz said, adding that Con Ed's response was also different.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Since the September storm, we have streamlined our customer service operation,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The utility has added more permanent phone lines and increased its work force, adding more customer service representatives and field crews.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's always room for improvement,'' he said. ''Those changes were something we felt would improve our communications with the customers. We had them ready to go.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT may go down as the ''Got milk?'' moment for the housing sector.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as dairy associations, with their widespread ads, have tried to convince Americans of the many benefits of milk, the National Association of Realtors will begin promoting the notion that buying a home is an unalloyed good in a $40 million campaign that boldly declares: ''It's a great time to buy or sell a home.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ads will try to counter the drumbeat of dour housing data and news by making the case that historically low interest rates, a large supply of homes on the market and the group's forecast of rising prices next year make now an ideal time to buy a home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign, which was developed by the Most Agency, based in Newport Beach, Calif., starts today with full-page ads in The Wall Street Journal and USA Today. It will make its way into other newspapers, including The New York Times, over the weekend and onto television and radio networks early next year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In visiting our local associations and state associations, we were hearing our members saying, 'God, we are getting beat up out there,' '' said Thomas M. Stevens, who is president of the trade group that represents 1.3 million real estate agents and owns a real estate brokerage firm in the Washington area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think we need to tell them that the stars are aligned right now and the conditions are ideal for buyers,'' he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Independent economists, however, are somewhat more skeptical. Many predict that sales and prices, as measured by the association, which fell in August and September from a year ago, may decline further because there are too many homes on the market and because the rapid run-up in prices has put homeownership out of reach of many.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can make the case that prices will rise in areas of the country that did not have a bubble,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers. But ''in the hot markets, I would say you are in for a two- to three-year adjustment in prices, not a collapse but a steady drop in prices.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harris recommends that buyers base their purchase decision on whether they intend to live in an area for a few years, not on the outlook for home prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Showing how perilous the art of forecasting can be, the ad by the National Association of Realtors cites a 4.3 percent increase in the number of existing home sales contracts signed in August, from July, as evidence that ''prices over all have stabilized.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Wednesday, new data released by the association showed that contract signings fell 1.1 percent in September, from August, and 13.6 percent from September 2005. A spokesman said that the first ads were prepared before the latest figures were available and would be updated next week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stevens dismissed the idea that the campaign, the first of its kind undertaken by the association, could be viewed as a sign of desperation. He noted that sales were on track to hit their third-highest level in 2006; 2005 and 2004 rank first and second.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't have a record year every year,'' he said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders, struggling to keep ahead in a weakening market, cut prices and offered a variety of other discounts in September to help sell their newly constructed houses, the latest government and industry statistics show.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the median price of a new home plunged 9.7 percent last month, compared with September 2005, falling to $217,100, the biggest such drop since December 1970.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statistics from the National Association of Home Builders showed a similar slide. Builders reported cutting prices in September by 5 percent, according to the association's most recent data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just two months ago, prices of new homes were still on the rise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least to some extent, the lower prices achieved the developers' goal: the backlog of unsold new homes on the market fell in September for the second consecutive month, while the number sold, adjusted for normal seasonal variations, rose by 5.3 percent from the previous month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists and industry experts noted that the reported numbers provide a somewhat distorted picture of market reality. While they seemed to suggest a rebound in sales and a precipitous drop in prices, the data was skewed by a higher number of sales in the South, where homes are cheaper, and fewer in the more expensive Northeast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, sales in the South accounted for 56 percent of all new homes sold in the country, compared with 52 percent a year earlier. The average square footage of a house sold in September declined as well, pulling down the median price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new-home prices across the country may not be falling quite as sharply as the reported numbers suggest, builders are also offering a variety of hidden price cuts in response to the much harsher housing climate that they now face.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to run our business as if it's going to stay tough for a while,'' said Richard J. Dugas Jr., chief executive of Pulte Homes, one of the nation's largest residential builders. On Wednesday, Pulte said its profit in the third quarter fell by more than half, compared with the same period a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, profits are falling fast in many parts of the country for builders, who are rapidly scaling back on their future construction plans.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home builders' association reported that 45 percent of builders and developers said they cut prices in September to maintain sales volume. That was up from only 19 percent a year earlier. Similarly, the association reported that 55 percent offered amenities like granite counters or upgraded kitchen cabinets for no additional cost. Only 19 percent did so a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of those incentives was not reflected in the new-home price data, which suggested that builders were making even less money from each sale than the shrinking official prices would indicate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Builders do not like to lower prices because it sends the wrong signal to potential buyers,'' Patrick Newport, an economist with Global Insight, said in a research note. ''How much incentives matter today is difficult to gauge -- but in markets in which power is quickly shifting from sellers to buyers, they probably matter quite a bit.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cancellations were also left out of the new-home statistics. The Commerce Department records a new home as sold when the buyer and builder sign a contract. The home builders association said that cancellations had jumped by 50 percent in the last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The cancellation rate is really big,'' said Dave Seiders, chief economist of the association. ''It's exploded over the last year.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-home sales report followed a report that showed softness in the market for previously owned homes, which account for about 85 percent of all home sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of existing-home sales in September slowed 14 percent from a year earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.2 million. That was the lowest rate reported since January 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For new homes, the seasonally adjusted annual sales volume figure in September was 1.1 million -- 14.2 percent lower than in September 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another closely watched economic barometer released this morning -- the Census Bureau's report on durable goods orders -- showed an unexpected 7.8 percent rise for September from August. Durable goods, which include things like dishwashers, are monitored by economists as a gauge of business investment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upswing, however, was almost entirely a result of a surge in orders for aircraft. Boeing took orders for 175 planes last month, nearly tripling the nonmilitary aircraft component of the durable goods figure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the latest economic data pointed to continued but slower growth through the end of the summer. When orders for the transportation equipment sector were stripped out, the gain in durable goods orders was only 0.1 percent.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is almost too easy to be charmed by the latest trend in time shares, what is called fractional real estate. After all, who wouldn't be wooed by amenities like ski-in/ski-out access, granite countertops and outdoor fireplaces?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A high-end spin on the traditional time share, fractionals typically entitle users to multiple weeks' stay, and the developments themselves have decidedly luxury touches, with upmarket appliances, finishes and linens, as well as amenities like spas. In short, developers say, it is a way to get access to a million dollar-plus property for much less than the full price of ownership.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all the variety on the market today, buying would appear to be a snap. But how these units stand up in the resale market remains to be seen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In markets like Aspen, Colo., that have seen a tight supply of real estate and continued escalation of prices, sales of fractionals remain strong. The Residences at the Little Nell across from the Silver Queen gondola in Aspen is selling one-eighth shares of its three-bedroom units, entitling buyers to six weeks of use, for $1,475,000. The developer increased prices 10 times over the past year and a half, pushing the sales price for a share of a four-bedroom unit to $2.5 million from $1.35 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in La Scala, a fractional development planned for the Lake Las Vegas community in Henderson, Nev., the sales shop was shut down at the end of September. ''We didn't meet pre-sales requirements so we had to cancel the project,'' said Melissa Clancy, the director of marketing for Storied Places, the developer of La Scala. After a year-long sales push, only 30 shares were sold. Storied Places also recently cancelled a fractional project in Mammoth Lakes, Calif.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it does come time for individuals to resell shares, one concern is whether the developer has already sold its own inventory. Dennis Jung, an agent with Frias Properties of Aspen, has several fractional listings, including units at the Ritz-Carlton Club Aspen Highlands. ''They still have a few interests left to sell,'' Mr. Jung said. ''That would set the market in that case.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it can take years for the developer to completely clear their inventory. The Timbers Club in Snowmass Village, Colo., took about four years to sell all of its shares, while the residences at Esperanza resort in Cabo San Lucas in Mexico, sold out this year, three years after sales began.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, there is little data on fractional resales. Ragatz Associates, a research firm, estimates that resales made up just $48 million of the $2 billion fractional sales market in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newness of the industry has academics scratching their heads, saying that they can only look toward the history of timeshares to gauge how these homes might do on the resale market. ''While it's ultimately too early'' to make a call on fractional re-sales, said Stuart Gabriel, the director of the University of Southern California's Lusk Center for Real Estate, ''it should be noted that the resale market for time shares is generally quite weak.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents report that it can take longer to sell a fractional property than a house or a condominium. Heather Stolz, a real estate agent with Remax Vail Valley who spent several years working for developers selling fractionals before joining her current agency, is seeing more developers start to handle their own resales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the entrance of these companies into the fractional market is serving to boost the image of the industry. ''The big guys -- the Ritz, Four Seasons, Starwood and Marriott -- have given legitimacy to timeshares even thought they don't want to be called timeshares,'' Ms. Stolz said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene Northup, a real estate agent in Las Vegas, said he is still not convinced. In fact, when the La Scala sales project ended, he said he wasn't surprised. ''I was scared to death of it. It was around $350,000 to $400,000 to purchase,'' said Mr. Northup, noting that buyers still had to pay $12,000 in annual association fees for six weeks of use a year. The general slowdown in that price range of the market did not bode well for the project either. ''The big money is sill moving around, but anything on the market from $300,000 to $400,000 is not moving,'' he said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OLATHE, Kan. -- New census data shows that people are paying more of their income for housing in almost every part of the country. And it is hardly surprising that places like Southern California and Manhattan are high on the list.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Olathe? In northeast Kansas?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Olathe (pronounced oh-LAY-thuh), 20 miles southwest of Kansas City, showed the biggest jump in the percentage of people paying at least 30 percent of their income on rent, as well as in those paying at least 50 percent on rent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a largely rural state not known for growth or overwhelming prosperity, here is a minimetropolis of manmade neighborhood waterfalls, of seemingly endless construction of shopping malls and office parks. Executives and immigrant workers, retirees and young families have all been drawn to its abundance of jobs, parks and high-performing public schools.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's basically been a supernova in terms of its growth,'' said Arthur P. Hall, the executive director of the Center for Applied Economics at the University of Kansas School of Business. ''It's a major suburb of Kansas City and for whatever reason has become the place to go. And that I can't explain.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since Olathe's days as a stagecoach stop on the old Santa Fe Trail there have been newcomers at the crossroads here, usually to take a rest and to move on. But as this prairie town and former bedroom community of close to 120,000 looks back to celebrate its 150th birthday, it is clear what has changed: people come to stay. And they pay a lot to do it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We grow 10 people a day, every single day,'' Mayor Michael Copeland boasts, and population statistics back him up: Olathe has expanded by about 4,000 people a year for the past several years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1980, the population has more than tripled. And in the last five years, the average price for a new home has doubled to about $350,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The census data was collected before the real estate market began softening over the last year, and it was based on a small sample size, experts cautioned. And at the high economic end, Olathe is dominated by homeowners who can afford their properties without mortgages, in one of the most prosperous counties in the country.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But still, that a city in the Great Plains surrounded by farmland registered at all on such a list of expensive places left some regional economic analysts scratching their heads.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew A. Beveridge, a demographer at Queens College in New York who analyzed the national data, which came from the 2005 American Community Survey, said: ''The rental burden is off the tracks there. Over all, a lot of people were stunned by the massive increases in the Midwest.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DeeDee Palermo is one Olathe resident who feels crushed under the weight of the local housing market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm a single mom and I can't make it on my own here, so I live with my mother,'' said Ms. Palermo, 51, a retail store supervisor. ''We've had all this massive growth, but for some people, things are worse than ever. I work full time plus some, and I can't find a place to move to. Landlords want $800 and $1,300 a month. I just say, 'What? That's impossible!' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Palermo, 51, earns $8.75 an hour. She moved her family to Olathe a few years ago because she thought they could live better here than in Southern California or Arizona, where Ms. Palermo held a variety of jobs. She is disappointed. ''You can't make it here unless you pair up,'' she said. ''I can't even think about owning a home.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The census data crystallized what many here like Ms. Palmero already knew: the housing burden is not carried uniformly, and it is particularly daunting for those with low or stagnant wages who have had to deal with the reality of escalating real estate costs. In that respect, some say, Kansas is not all that different from Manhattan or anyplace else.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But compounding the problem here is that growth has happened so quickly, the housing market is neither mature nor diversified, local economists and real estate agents said. Most new construction is expensive and geared toward single-family ownership.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new economics are particularly hard on renters and those in search of affordable houses to buy, as is typically the case in fast-growth suburbs and exurbs around the country. Single-family homes designed for owner occupancy yield greater returns to developers and municipalities than cheaper multifamily or rental units. That reality often results in lopsided development favoring families with lots of money to spend on upscale housing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As communities develop, they tend to attract higher and higher prices for housing, and the community becomes more attractive,'' said Dean Katerndahl, an analyst at the Mid-America Regional Council, a planning organization for greater Kansas City. ''We're trying to advocate that there needs to be more variety in choices of housing, in the price basis but also in types.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In and around Olathe, a name from the Shawnee word for beautiful, corporate headquarters dot the grassy landscape. Sprint, Honeywell and Garmin International, to name a few, are major corporations that have brought thousands of jobs to the area in recent years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of office parks are under construction, as are more than a dozen residential subdivisions. The city has added more than 30,000 jobs in the last five years by marketing itself to information-age companies and emphasizing the convenience of its location in the middle of America.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are really the suburb of the entire nation,'' Mayor Copeland said. ''You can get anywhere in three hours for $300.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Olathe prides itself on its growing stock of executive-style housing for those whom Mr. Copeland calls ''our captains of industry.'' Custom-designed houses on landscaped streets with garage space for three or more cars are common.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, census figures show that per capita income is $28,373, and for those who do not own a home, the median rent is $676 for what is typically a six-room apartment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2000, the portion of the city's population paying more than 35 percent of its income to rent grew to 42 percent from 19 percent, the same data shows. It also says there are almost three times as many owner-occupied units here than rental units, which number about 10,700.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poverty rate is also increasing, because the area's growth is also attracting people with lower incomes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews, city officials tended to say that the housing stock was sufficiently varied and, while expressing concern about growing poverty, showed a sense of pride in Olathe's costliness.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that's a sign of success,'' Mr. Copeland said. ''It shows people are willing to pay a lot to live here.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Sherman, the assistant city manager, said, ''It might just be that the location comes with such amenities that they're willing to spend their hard-earned dollars on it.'' She added, ''We don't have mountains or oceans, but we have some of the greatest people.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders and residents say the growing lack of low-cost housing cannot be viewed as good.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been unfortunate from our perspective in the last few years to see so many people who'd like to live in Olathe not be able to because the housing prices have gone up so much,'' said Matt Derrick, the spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Greater Kansas City. ''We have builders who say, I can't build housing that my kids could afford to live in. That's when it really starts to hit home.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growth in Olathe through the 1990's was driven, incidentally, by what was then its affordable housing and by the rapidly developing high-tech industries here, experts said. But, over the years, demand for the area has priced out some long-term residents and newcomers whose wages are moderate to low -- mainly the workers in retail and construction, whose numbers have been steadily increasing, too.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials could not say exactly where the newcomers have been coming from, but they sense that much of the migration is from rapidly depopulating farm counties in western Kansas, and from similarly struggling regions around the Midwest. The city also has a growing Latino population.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We ask the same questions: Where are the new people from? And why are they coming here?'' said Ms. Sherman, the assistant city manager.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, there was an increase in the number of permits issued for attached housing and large apartment complexes, which may ease some of the housing burden.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty families are on a waiting list for emergency housing provided by the Salvation Army. More than 800 families applied in August for food assistance at the local Catholic Charities office. But looking around the well-kept city, it is hard to see signs of struggle. Even older neighborhoods and strip malls are neat, and the streets and highways are humming with traffic.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There isn't a stereotypical ghetto here, you're not going to see skid row,'' said Shirley Kelso, the manager of the Family Support Center at Catholic Charities. ''It's a different kind of below-the-surface thing. Most of our folks are working and spending half or more of their disposable income on shelter, and that doesn't leave a lot.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tamara Fiehler finds herself in exactly that situation. Ms. Fiehler is behind on her mortgage payments and is training for a new job that does not pay until she begins working. ''My money goes toward my kids and their lunches and clothes,'' she said. ''I've used up my savings trying to pay the mortgage, and I can't anymore.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Fiehler, 44, said she had thought about moving someplace cheaper but could not afford to leave her three-bedroom ranch house in Olathe.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm very happy with the schools, and that's one good reason to be here,'' she said. ''Plus, I'd have to get up on my feet before I'd have enough money to go anywhere else.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article last Friday about the market for houses at ski resorts referred incorrectly to a real estate agent in Crested Butte, Colo. Reggie Masters is a woman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Oct 27 2006   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN her multiyear search for a mountain retreat, Anne Bodine-Cresci saw prices in Stowe, Vt., rise higher than the mountaintops. Her quest was framed by an increasing number of million-dollar-plus homes, pricey fixer-uppers and a limited supply of new listings. ''Some places,'' Ms. Cresci said, ''were going for a lot more than they probably should have.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for Ms. Cresci, who lives in Bonita Springs, Fla., this year brought a long-awaited change: more choices in Stowe, and at last a condo that fit her needs: a newly constructed, four-bedroom, 3,000-square-foot unit with custom finishes that sits on a hill about four miles from downtown. Ms. Cresci paid about $900,000 for the condo, which is part of an existing development in Stowe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Prices haven't necessarily come down,'' said Ms. Cresci, who will close on her condominium this fall. ''But there is definitely more inventory this year than in the past few years.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the fall buying season builds in ski resort towns, potential buyers are likely to find a changed real estate market. Just as the brakes have slammed in warm-weather second-home destinations, second-home sales in many ski towns have slowed compared with the market this time last year, real estate agents say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents in ski towns from Vermont to California report that more homes and condos are available, that homebuyers for the first time in years have a bit of negotiating power and that, in a few cases, sellers have started to trim their prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are exceptions: activity and price increases are still robust in the toniest ski towns in Colorado, and there is still strong demand for multimillion-dollar dwellings at ski resorts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall trend, however, is a cool down. ''Real estate is slowing in a very significant manner,'' said Stuart Gabriel, the director of the University of Southern California's Lusk Center for Real Estate. ''The larger trends that we are seeing do translate into second homes and investment properties in resort areas.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a cool down at resorts hasn't put a halt on development, at least not yet. For buyers in search of new construction, there are more choices and more amenities. Once-sleepy little ski resort towns, including Crested Butte, Colo., and Truckee, Calif., 15 miles north of Lake Tahoe, are getting polished liftside ski villages with high-end shopping, restaurants and condos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Stowe this fall, there are new construction and improvements on the mountain. A lift opening this winter will take skiers from Spruce Peak over to Mount Mansfield. At a development at the base of the mountain called Spruce Peak at Stowe, a new lodge, spa and golf course will be completed next year, and the next round of 3,000-square-foot cabins are starting at $2.2 million. Fully furnished condos are on the market for $350,000 to $1.5 million at the Stowe Mountain Lodge. But David Norden, the vice president of Spruce Peak at Stowe, the lodge project's developer, acknowledges that the market is not as active as it was last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buyers are taking more time, and they are doing their due diligence,'' Mr. Norden said. ''But I don't think we have a real problem. We still have limited inventory, and the master plan for this is only 400 units.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The time it takes to sell a house or condo has roughly doubled in Stowe the last year, but average sale prices have risen to more than $760,000 for a single-family house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIKE Stowe, other East Coast ski resorts are undergoing an increase in the number of houses and condos available, and the impact on those markets is even more tangible, brokers say. In Killington, Vt., Tricia Carter, a broker at Killington's Ski Country Real Estate, said that sellers are beginning to take a look at their asking prices and make changes. ''Some of them have dropped their prices to adjust for the inactivity,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate sales in Killington are down some 37 percent, and the time it takes to get a house or condo under contract has jumped to 250 days from 157 days since this time last year, according to Laird Bradley, the broker at Williamson Group Sotheby's International Realty. ''It's quite a bit slower,'' he said, though he noted that overall sales prices had ticked up to an average of $240,000, some $17,000 higher than last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While agents in Stowe report that this year has been slower than last, many note that business is picking up as leaf peepers make their way into town for foliage season. ''We were busier in September than we were all year,'' said Pall Spera, a Stowe real estate broker. ''The market continues to be improved for us in October.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A slowdown has also hit West Coast ski-resort markets. ''We are in a bit of a stall here, but the whole California market is in a bit of a stall,'' said Paul Oster, the broker and owner of ReMax of Mammoth, which is near Mammoth Mountain -- a Central California ski resort in the Sierra Nevadas 310 miles north of Los Angeles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mammoth's prices haven't yet turned down. Sales in Mammoth dropped 38 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, yet the average selling prices for condos were up 10 percent, according to the Mammoth Lakes Board of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glen Hellings estimates that his condo purchase in Mammoth a year ago has already kicked up a healthy appreciation. With 30-odd ski seasons under his parka, Mr. Hellings took the plunge into the Mammoth real estate market last year, landing a two-bedroom slopeside condominium in a three-year-old development with ski in/ski-out access, just in time for a record season of 668 inches of snow.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The cost was higher than our initial budget, but we loved it,'' said Mr. Hellings, who paid in the ''high six figures'' for the condo and estimated that it has appreciated 10 percent since then. ''I think Mammoth is a direct reflection of the Southern California real estate market, especially the beach communities, where the prices are nut case,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farther north, real estate agents in Truckee, Calif., report that the bar to get into the market is still high. Houses under $700,000 make up the low end of the market and are mostly 10 years old or older. Anything over $750,000 is likely to have been built in the late 1990's or even more recently.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the market as a whole is ''taking a little breather,'' said Rich Harter, the broker at Truckee's Pacific Crest Properties, the highest end of the market is still showing signs of life with strong interest in some listings. ''A $2.6 million house just had three offers on it,'' Mr. Harter said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end properties are still doing well at resorts in Idaho. Tamarack in Donnelly, where a new Fairmont resort will break ground next summer, has sold more than 500 properties from $429,000 to $3 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Sun Valley and Ketchum, Idaho, a handful of new developments have added to the inventory, and buyers are starting to see incentives. At Trail Creek Crossings, a 13-unit development in Ketchum, developers are throwing in a garage. ''Typically they would charge $40,000 for that,'' said Grady Burnett, the broker at Sun Valley Brokers, which is the agent for the development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't look for any breaks in the most desirable, celebrity-laden ski towns in Colorado, like Aspen and Vail. There, big demand and big prices continue. The number of transactions in Aspen and Snowmass Village is up about 10 percent over last year, and sale prices are up 21 percent over 2005, according to Dusty Diaz, the managing broker of Mason Morse office in Aspen. In Vail, according to the local board of Realtors, the number of home sales is down this year, but the average sale price has jumped to $1.1 million from $850,000 in 2005, and the time it takes to sell a home has remained steady since 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Residences at Little Nell, a low-rise fractional development under construction that will be operated by the well-known Little Nell hotel in Aspen, is selling one-eighth shares in three- and four-bedroom condos for about $1.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively, while at Snowmass Village, a new base village is going up with 613 condos. The first 87 units (the only condos to be released for sale so far) are already under contract with prices ranging from $500,000 to just under $2 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They sold out immediately, and local property owners got first pick,'' said BJ Adams, a real estate broker in Snowmass Village. She said there was little sign of changing demand. ''The general public didn't have a chance. There is very little new product here, and that has allowed sellers to really reach for unprecedented prices.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mountain towns farther south in Colorado are also having an influx of development. At Crested Butte, the purchase of the resort two years ago by Tim and Diane Mueller, owners of the Okemo Mountain Resort in Vermont, helped push forward several projects, including new snowmaking equipment, trails and residential construction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lodge at Mountaineer Square, part of the base village at the Crested Butte Mountain Resort, had $80 million in sales in one day in 2005, and reservations are now being taken for the next round of condos, which will go under contract in early December. So far, demand for the condos has been steady, bucking the slowing trend of the rest of the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of reservations, according to Reggie Masters, an agent with Coldwell Banker Bighorn Realty in Crested Butte, is ''pretty close to on track,'' despite a slower market over all this year. ''We had a couple of really hot years just after the Muellers purchased the ski area,'' he said. ''The market is still healthy, but inventory is up, and sales aren't as brisk as they have been.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the United States, the news for home builders seems dismal. The National Association of Realtors forecast this week that new-home prices in 2006 will show an annual decline for the first time since 1991. The inventory of houses for sale is at the highest level in history and some economists say a housing slowdown could bring on a recession.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the stock market, which hated home builders for much of 2006, now thinks it sees signs of hope. One Wall Street analyst, Michael Rehaut of J. P. Morgan, pointed to inventory numbers, of all things, as a reason for optimism as he raised ratings on some builders this week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance, such an opinion seems absurd. The first chart shows the number of homes and condominiums for sale at the end of each month. (Only existing condominiums, as opposed to newly constructed ones, are included, a fact that no doubt holds down the inventory level.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of August, the latest figures available, there were 4.5 million homes and condos available for sale, more than double the number in late 2001 and up 35 percent from a year earlier. It was the highest figure ever.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the second chart shows, the year-over-year growth in inventories peaked in May, with a 38 percent rise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Mr. Rehaut, that is significant. ''While pricing, orders and starts may still show negative trends in the near term,'' he wrote this week, ''we believe inventories -- the leading driver of the market's pullback, on our view, as well as our prior cautious stance -- have begun to stabilize and in turn should drive a market recovery.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market is supposed to forecast the future, turning lower before the bad news and higher before the news grows good. In that regard, it got the decline right, with the Bloomberg United States home builder index, shown in the third chart, peaking in July 2005, when the housing sales statistics were running strong but the inventory numbers had started to edge up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the record close to the low this summer, almost exactly a year later, that index fell 46 percent, although even then it was up more than 250 percent from the end of 1999. Since then, it has risen 20 percent, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index is up only 10 percent. Whether that stock market rebound will last is, of course, a subject of debate. While it is true that figures from HousingTracker.net show inventories of unsold homes have begun to slip in a few previously hot markets like San Diego and Washington, they remain at quite high levels. There is no guarantee that sales will not soften more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declines in the number of homes for sale may come from owners taking their homes off the market because they are unwilling to accept the prices available, hardly a positive sign. And investors may have underestimated the damage already done. Centex's report of low profits and record cancellations of home purchase contracts --it blamed the inability of buyers to sell their existing homes -- caused housing shares to sink yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A genuine bottom in the housing market would come as a great relief to Washington policy makers, who have been uncertain what would enable consumers to keep spending if they can no longer monetize rising real estate values and have been worried that exotic mortgages might bring great pain to homeowners who cannot afford to meet higher payments that will someday be required.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of new houses will fall this year for the first time since 1991, and existing homes will have the smallest gain ever, as a glut of properties forces sellers to accept lower offers, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a new home will probably dip 0.2 percent to $240,500, the first decline since a drop of 2.4 percent 15 years ago, according to the association.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of new and existing homes for sale has swelled to record levels as the five-year housing boom has slowed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes probably will drop 8.9 percent this year, to 6.45 million, the association said.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have been waiting to buy a Manhattan apartment until after prices come tumbling down, you may have to wait a little longer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan co-op and condominium prices sagged a bit last quarter, in the usually slow summer selling season, but by most measures they remained healthily above prices reported a year ago, according to a number of competing market reports released yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conclusion of many of the brokerage firms releasing reports was that after a large advance in prices over the last few years, followed by several quarters of uncertainty, the market was essentially stable during the last quarter, despite the fact that apartments from a wave of new construction are coming on the market and there was continuing uncertainty about the direction of interest rates and the economy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been on the freeway for four years at 90 miles an hour, and now we are at a regular pace of 60,'' said Michael Martin, the director of research at Mitchell, Maxwell &amp; Jackson, an appraisal firm, which released one of five reports made available yesterday, and collaborated with the Corcoran Group on a second report, with slightly different numbers. ''We are back to a fairly regular pace of sales activity.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The various reports' figures for the average decline in price of a Manhattan apartment ranged from 1 percent to 10 percent from the previous quarter, with larger price declines in the sales of older co-ops being offset by increases in the average price of condominiums, including the sales of many new apartments that often sell at a premium.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average prices declined on the West Side of Manhattan by up to 17 percent during the quarter, offset in part by rising prices on the East Side, according to several of the studies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prudential Douglas Elliman, whose study reported the highest quarterly sales prices, put the average sale price at $1.3 million, down 7 percent from the prior quarter, and 12 percent above the $1.15 million average sales reported a year ago. Another brokerage firm, Brown Harris Stevens, put the average price at $1.1 million, 10 percent below the previous quarter and 4 percent below figures it recorded a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Offsetting the quarterly decline were other figures suggesting the market was essentially stable. The number of sales recorded during the quarter rose, and the number of listings of apartments at Manhattan brokerage firms was flat, after rising 32 percent during the previous year, according to the Elliman study. The average number of days an apartment was on the market increased slightly, from 144 to 150. Rising inventory can indicate a weakening market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although hundreds of apartment sales are recorded by the city each week throughout the summer, an increase in activity was reported in recent weeks. Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm that prepared a market study for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that many buyers were ''sitting on the fence'' and unable to make a decision. At the same time, he said, sellers had not significantly dropped prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nobody is making a decision,'' he said. ''At some point someone has to blink.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said that in the last few years, prices have declined and sales have slowed in the third quarter, only to regain momentum, as buyers, stirred by bonuses on Wall Street, rushed in to buy expensive apartments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the uncertainty over the direction of the Manhattan market comes from the many ambiguous and contradictory market reports issued by various brokerage firms. They all combine publicly available data on co-op and condo sales, with proprietary information on closed sales that have not yet been filed and recorded. The result is that each report includes a different mix of sales, and may record the same sales in different quarters as information becomes available.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes the information available is incomplete. Mr. Miller, for example, said the increase in reported sales might be the result in part of better data collection, as the city provided public access to sale prices of co-ops that had not previously been available.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, noted that while the overall market paused in the last few quarters, the prices on smaller apartments had continued to rise, driving up median prices, a measure less influenced by multimillion-dollar sales, making even small apartments more expensive. As a result, some developers of new apartments have been offering concessions, such as covering closing costs, that would reduce the cash outlay needed to buy an apartment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, chief economist for Brown Harris Stevens, who produced the most seemingly pessimistic figures, said the price decline actually captured a market shift. He said the decline in average sales prices reflected a change in the typical apartments sold: the average apartment size dropped and the price per square foot rose.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he expected the strong local economy, and modest interest rates, to keep the co-op and condominium markets stable.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A front-page article last Tuesday about the rising burden of housing costs nationwide misspelled the name of a Virginia county where census figures showed a big increase in the percentage of people spending at least 30 percent of their incomes on housing. It is Loudoun, not Loudon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Tue Oct 10 2006   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The burden of housing costs in nearly every part of the country grew sharply from 2000 to 2005, according to new Census Bureau data being made public today. The numbers vividly illustrate the impact, often distributed unevenly, of the crushing combination of escalating real estate prices and largely stagnant incomes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many of the highest home values were on the coasts, in places like Southern California and Manhattan, many of the biggest jumps in the percentage of people paying a burdensome amount of their income for housing occurred in the Midwest and in suburbs nationwide, making it clear that the housing squeeze has reached deep into the middle class.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, more than half of all renters now spend at least 30 percent of their gross income on housing, a percentage figure commonly seen as a limit of affordability. In Staten Island, the percentage paying at least 30 percent of income rose to nearly 60 percent, up from 40.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among suburban homeowners, there were big increases in the percentage of people with mortgages spending at least 30 percent in places like Loudon County, Va.; Morgan County, Ind.; Nassau County, on Long Island; and Bastrop County, Tex.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing prices have gone up much more than incomes have,'' said Christopher Jones, vice president for research at the Regional Plan Association in New York City. ''Clearly, you can't sustain that sort of imbalance over the long run. There's only so long that housing prices can go up without sustained increases in income to support them.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data, from the American Community Survey, was collected throughout 2005, some of it before the real estate market began softening over the past year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the escalation in house prices that began in the mid-1990's has slowed down in most places, and while prices are even dropping in some markets, rents are currently rising.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, it is not unprecedented for housing prices to rise faster than household incomes, since housing prices fluctuate more than median incomes. In recent decades, median incomes have not risen at the rate that they did in the booming 1950's and 1960's, yet real estate prices in many parts of the country have escalated sharply in recent years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People want to hang on and stay in the market,'' said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution in Washington, ''and they are willing to stretch themselves to find or to rent a house that is suitable.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The places with the highest overall percentages of people carrying a heavy housing burden were in fast-growing areas of California, Colorado and Texas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Southern California, Temecula and Hemet had the highest percentages of renters paying at least 30 percent, with 74 and 73 percent of renters at that level.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boulder, Colo., and College Station, Tex., held the record for renters spending at least 50 percent, with 47 and 46 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest jump in the percentages of people paying at least 30 percent of their income on rent, as well as those spending at least 50 percent, occurred in Olathe, Kan., a booming suburb of 114,000 southwest of Kansas City.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S. Lawrence Yun, an economist with the National Association of Realtors, said renters in desirable cities might be spending more of their income on housing in hopes of getting a toehold in places with good schools, better homes and a good quality of life. He said, ''There is certainly a concern that people are devoting a large portion of their income to housing, and one of the reasons is due to the more limited housing supply.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the New York region, a very high percentage of renters in urban counties spent a big share of income on housing. In the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, close to a third of all renters pay at least 30 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many of the biggest increases in housing burdens occurred outside the city.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among homeowners, there were big increases in the percentage of people spending at least 30 percent on housing in counties like Nassau, Dutchess, Orange and Putnam. The percentage of households spending at least 50 percent of income also rose in those counties.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Clifton, N.J., the percentage of mortgage holders spending at least 50 percent of their income on housing rose to 27 percent in 2005 from 12 percent in 2000, a 134 percent rise. In New Britain, Conn., the group paying at least 30 percent more than doubled, rising to 57 percent of people with mortgages, up from 27 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the biggest increase in homeowners spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing occurred in an unincorporated area southeast of Los Angeles called Florence-Graham, where more than a third of residents live in poverty. There, the figure climbed to 43 percent from 17 percent. Other places with big jumps included Wyoming, Mich.; Round Rock, Tex.; and Plymouth, Minn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, the places with the highest overall percentages of homeowners spending that level of income were poorer cities. El Monte, Calif., a Los Angeles suburb, had the highest percentage of mortgage holders, 73 percent, spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing. In Newark, the figure was 72 percent; in El Cajon, Calif., east of San Diego, 69 percent; and in South Gate, Calif., 69 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Kyser, senior economist with the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, said such cities are often the only places that people on the lowest rungs of the economic ladder can afford and they tend to stretch their resources to get in. He said El Monte and South Gate both are growing, largely because Latinos have been moving in.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These communities are well located to employment opportunities and they can drive and it is not a horrendous drive,'' he said. ''They are also close to public transportation and use it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers, which were analyzed for The New York Times by Andrew A. Beveridge, a demographer at Queens College, provided a glimpse of how hot -- and how unhot -- some areas had become.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Southern California coastal cities, Santa Barbara and Newport Beach, had the highest median house values, at $1 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Youngstown, Ohio, a city long hurting economically, had the lowest, at $48,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York State, the median value of owner-occupied homes actually declined slightly in a few upstate counties, including Oswego, Steuben and Madison. The median house value dropped 9 percent in Buffalo, to $60,800.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing values rose only barely in some upstate counties, including Cattaraugus, Cayuga, Chautauqua and Chemung.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of a change in census procedures, it was not possible yesterday to reliably gauge the increase in cost burden among homeowners in places with large numbers of condominium or cooperative apartments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2000, the bureau did not count owner-occupied apartments in multifamily buildings; in 2005, it did. So the 2000 and 2005 figures could not be satisfactorily compared for places like Manhattan and San Diego.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, where the median value of all owner-occupied homes hit $718,000, the increase in median gross rents from 2000 to 2005 was 14 percent, well below the 20 percent jump in Suffolk County on Long Island, the 23 percent rise in the city of Passaic, N.J., and the 24 percent jump in Ulster County, N.Y.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in the percentage of Manhattan renters paying at least 50 percent of their income on housing was 13 percent -- well below the 50 percent rise in Rockland County.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data also showed that, among couples living together in Manhattan, about 17 percent were unmarried in 2005, compared with 10 percent nationwide.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan appeared to have the second highest number of male couples living together, following Los Angeles.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, there was plenty of fodder last week for Americans' favorite parlor game: trying to figure out just where this crazy housing market will bounce next -- or, more particularly, what their own house will be worth next month or next year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, even with one report after another suggesting that the long, heady party is really and truly over, prices for existing homes (they're like used cars, minus the stigma) kept inching up -- if they were measured year to year. But in August, for the first time since 1995, prices slipped a bit from the previous August. (New-home sales rose in August, but that counts only the number sold, and economists warned not to read too much into that.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were down in most regions, with the median price in the Northeast going to $271,000 from $282,000, the Midwest to $176,000 from $178,000 and the South to $184,000 from $189,000. Only the perennially wild West showed a gain, to $345,000 from $344,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the way things are going, homeowners out West will get theirs, too. HUBERT B. HERRING  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT does it take to sell a house in a slowing real estate market? Lou Aloupis thinks he knows: a 2006 Mercedes E-Class sedan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A partner in a contracting firm that renovates houses for resale, Mr. Aloupis is trying to sell a remodeled ranch on a dead-end street in Stamford. ''Every single thing in that house has been replaced,'' he said. Yet the listing has languished since February, and Mr. Aloupis is growing impatient.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has shaved more than $100,000 from the initial asking price, bringing it down to $679,000. He is offering the property through both a real estate agency and for-sale-by-owner Web sites. He even invited a woman who runs estate sales to display merchandise at the ranch, then distributed sales fliers to her customers. ''At the end of the day, nothing came of it,'' he said. ''Not even a phone call.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now he has sweetened the pot: Mr. Aloupis will sign over the lease on his Mercedes for one year to the buyer who closes on the house. He will prepay the lease; the buyer will have only insurance costs to cover.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Aloupis and his partners, Scott Kaluczky and Robert Bove, ''we'll be happy right now if somebody buys the house for $660,000,'' he said. ''We've got too much money tied up in it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Aloupis is not alone in his frustration with the changing market. Though median sales prices in Connecticut were still rising, albeit modestly, as of the end of July, single-family home sales were down 13 percent statewide for the year to date, according to the Warren Group, a real estate research and publishing company based in Boston. The drop was steepest in Fairfield County, where sales were down more than 20 percent for the first seven months of the year and 30 percent for July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accompanying increase in the number of available properties has many sellers scrambling for ways to make their houses stand out from the pack. While some agents are sticking to traditional marketing strategies like competitive pricing and added online exposure, others are adopting more creative attention-getting methods -- aimed not just at buyers, but at fellow agents as well.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's so much inventory out there that, to a great extent, it's a matter of just getting the brokers to your house,'' said Patti Ballard, a sales agent with William Pitt Sotheby's International in Ridgefield. ''Last year, we averaged 8 to 10 brokers' open houses on any one day in Ridgefield. Lately, we've had a couple of days with 34, 36 broker open houses. It can be overwhelming.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One local plastic surgeon is offering free Botox treatments to the agent who sells his home. Such incentives arouse curiosity, Ms. Ballard said. ''I'm not a big Botox girl myself,'' she said, ''but it certainly got my attention.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carole Maisano, an agent in the same office, is using a more exotic incentive to drum up agent interest in her 4,400-square-foot contemporary home in Wilton. Ms. Maisano listed the four-bedroom home in April for $1.375 million and has since reduced the price to $1.285 million. Showings dropped off, however, so she is now offering an African safari for two to the agent who brings a sale to closing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea arose from her husband's newest business venture: arranging customized safaris. The offer has not attracted significantly more traffic, but it has drawn agents from outside the immediate area, Ms. Maisano said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Markelz, a sales vice president at William Raveis Real Estate in Southport, sees extravagant incentives as more gimmick than effective sales tool.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, he worked with some builders who tried to attract buyers by offering to pay points and closing costs. ''It fell flat on its face,'' Mr. Markelz said. ''The consumer is sharp enough to say, 'Listen, what's the bottom-line price?' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dawn Grabover, an agent with Keller Williams Realty in Ridgefield, has tried a similar approach with her listing for a three-bedroom town house in Danbury. The unit has now spent five months on the market, so the owner is offering to credit the buyer six months' worth of common charges at closing. Coupled with a price reduction to $469,500 from $499,000, the offer was an attempt to distinguish this unit from the other 15 town homes for sale in the complex, Ms. Grabover said. As of yet, it has not attracted much interest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If buyers see through certain incentives, agents also sometimes steer clear of them. Safaris to Africa notwithstanding, state law stipulates that any incentive for selling a house must be given to the brokerage, not the individual agent, said Eugene Marconi, general counsel for the Connecticut Association of Realtors. The brokerage then decides what to do with it. The aim is to remove the temptation for sales agents to bump up their income by working out side deals, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of incentives is further diluted by the arrangements that many buyers' agents have with their clients that limit their ability to accept additional rewards, he noted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This incentive business is almost becoming an urban legend -- do this and you'll get droves of people coming to your house,'' Mr. Marconi said. ''But when you start peeling the layers away, oftentimes the incentive is not an incentive at all.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, however, brokerages do pass the incentive along to the deserving agent, according to Ms. Maisano. In offering the safari, she said, ''we assumed that the agency would just let the agent benefit. I've yet to see one that doesn't.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Colombie, director of sales and marketing for the New York-Connecticut division of Baker Residential, is trying a different tack for increasing sales at the company's Villages at Timber Oak, a 328-unit development in Bethel. Playing off the popularity of home-staging shows on HGTV, Mr. Colombie decided to try schooling homeowners interested in moving to Timber Oak how to sell their properties quickly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although more than 50 units at Timber Oak are in contract, Mr. Colombie said, some potential buyers appear reluctant to move forward because they have houses to sell.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 40 people recently turned up for free food and marketing advice at Mr. Colombie's first home-selling seminar in the development's gracious clubhouse.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A staging specialist recommended cleaning out closets and deodorizing carpets. A mortgage broker explained the intricacies of bridge financing. A real estate agent offered reassurances that the declining market was in fact returning to normalcy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to increase their comfort level,'' Mr. Colombie explained. ''To be honest with you, we're going to help some people sell their house, and then they'll buy somewhere else. But that's the nature of the game.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report yesterday showing that sales of new homes rose for the first time since March was -- at first glance -- welcome news for homebuilders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists warned that underneath the headline numbers, signs of a weakening housing market were more prevalent than ever.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That helped push down the inventory of unsold new homes 5.7 percent, to a 6.6-month supply, meaning that at the current selling rate, it would take 6.6 months to sell all the new homes currently on the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales figures for July were revised to show that fewer homes were sold than the government first reported. As a result, the August sales data probably exaggerates the resiliency of the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuart Hoffman, chief economist with PNC Financial, called the August increase a ''dead-cat bounce.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The August numbers could also be inflated. Because new-home sales are recorded when the contract is signed, not when the deal is closed, the data does not factor in cancellations. Builders have said recently that cancellation rates are running as high as 30 percent, suggesting that the Commerce Department's numbers make the housing market appear healthier than it actually is.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's report showed that builders are indeed having more and more difficulty selling homes. The median price of a new home fell to $237,000, down 1.3 percent from August 2005.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for previously owned homes are also falling. This week, the National Association of Realtors reported that for the first time in 11 years, the median price of a previously owned home fell from the price a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, prices slipped to $225,000, down 1.7 percent compared with August 2005. Sales of previously owned homes, which make up about 85 percent of all home sales annually, fell for the fifth consecutive month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few experts express confidence that these trends will reverse anytime soon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It certainly is possible that for a variety of reasons you could have a one-month upturn, but I doubt that will reverse the trend that seems to be occurring,'' said Kenneth Simonson, chief economist for the Associated General Contractors of America.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Simonson noted the possibility that the August sales numbers could be revised downward, just as the July numbers were. ''I think we could still wind up seeing that this month is a continuation of the downturn.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it is unwelcome news for anyone trying to sell a home, the slowdown in the housing market is just what policy makers at the Federal Reserve have been looking for.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As inflation quickened over the last several months, members of the Fed, led by the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have said that a slowing economy, led by cooling in the housing market, would be essential to holding prices down. So far, the Fed's economic forecast has been realized, with inflation slowing and home sales and prices falling.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was further evidence yesterday that the economy was slowing, as the Commerce Department reported an unexpected drop in orders for durable goods, a wide-ranging category that includes household appliances and factory machinery. The orders, a closely watched barometer of business investment, fell for the second consecutive month, dropping 0.5 percent, to $209.7 billion. It was first back-to-back decrease in more than two years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists disagree on whether the decline in August suggests a looming slowdown in business investment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Today's report points to a slowing in the manufacturing sector,'' wrote Peter E. Kretzmer, senior economist with Bank of America. ''Capital spending momentum remains solid but nonexceptional.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, others said the disappointing numbers were a result of the pessimistic business climate in the second half of the summer, fed by high energy prices and worries over inflation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has been a significant improvement in the overall investment climate in the past several weeks,'' wrote Brian Bethune, an economist with Global Insight. ''Steep declines in gasoline and diesel fuel prices should relieve recent downward pressure on margins, and provide a second wind to the profitability cycle. This should provide a lift to business confidence.''   </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Homes Post Price Drop For August  </span>
</div><div class="author">By JEREMY W. PETERS  </div><div>870 words</div><div>26 September 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices fell in August compared with a year earlier, the first such decline in more than a decade.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The August price data came with a report issued yesterday by the National Association of Realtors that showed further evidence of deterioration in the housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As median sales prices for existing homes slipped to $225,000 from $230,000 in July -- pushing them 1.7 percent lower than in August 2005 -- sales fell and the backlog of unsold homes continued to rise, the report said. The last time prices fell from their year-earlier level was in April 1995.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the market slide is almost certainly not over, the report suggested that it might be beginning to ease. Existing-home sales have been falling steadily in recent months, but the month-to-month decline in August was the smallest since March.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales dropped 0.5 percent from July to August, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.3 million units, the Realtors association said. That compares with a decline from June to July of 4.1 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd expect home sales to continue softening, but perhaps not at the dramatic pace we saw a little earlier,'' said Celia Chen, director of housing economics at Moody's Economy .com. ''The markets are just very overvalued right now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the sales trends are leveling off, however, prices still appear set to fall further.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David A. Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors association, said the price drop was a taste of what the market should expect in the coming months. But he predicted that prices would probably improve next year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're in for a ride right now,'' Mr. Lereah said. ''This is the first of many price corrections for the remaining months of the year -- for at least the next three or four months.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until this year, the housing sector had enjoyed a boom of more than half a decade, chalking up ever higher numbers of sales and rapidly rising prices. But it has been shrinking under the impact of rising mortgage rates and a slowing economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Realtors and economists see it, falling prices may be just what the housing market needs before sales can revive again. In some regions of the country last month, sales rose where prices fell. In the Northeast, sales rose 1.9 percent as the median price fell 3.9 percent, to $271,000. In the Midwest the pattern was the same: sales were up 0.7 percent and the median price was down 1.1 percent, to $176,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opposite occurred in the West. While prices have held steady there this summer, sales have fallen. In August, sales dropped 2.3 percent while the median price rose 0.3 percent, to $345,000. Compared with a year earlier, sales have fallen 22.8 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Something's going to give in the West,'' Mr. Lereah said. ''The correction has not occurred in the West yet. Sellers are stubborn there.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the South, sales volume in August was 0.8 percent lower than July 2006 and 7.4 percent lower than August 2005. The median existing-home price fell 2.6 percent, to $184,000, from July to August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, data from the federal government has shown prices leveling off for some time. A report from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight released this month showed that prices nationwide increased 1.2 percent in the second quarter, the weakest gain in almost seven years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists prefer the government's price data because it tries to adjust for changes in the quality and size of homes sold from one year to the next.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors association numbers do not take into account incentives by sellers, which could skew their median price numbers higher.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of August, there were so many unsold homes on the market that it would take seven and a half months to sell them all at the current sales pace. The association said that was the biggest backlog since April 1993.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said that as the number of unsold homes on the market continued to rise, sellers would have little choice but to cut prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With the supply of unsold homes reaching yet another record high, there is only one way this market can clear, and that is through even further price falls,'' wrote Dimitry Fleming, an economist for ING Bank. For all the worries about declining prices, though, Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist with MFR, said the price decline in August should be viewed in the context of a 111 percent increase in the median single-family home price over the last 11 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The underlying trend here is one of stable to modestly lower prices after the sharp gains seen for many years,'' he wrote in a research note. ''It should not be a huge shock that we are seeing a price correction.''  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Some Housing Pessimism From Real Estate Brokers  </span>
</div><div class="author">By JEREMY W. PETERS; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting.  </div><div>1074 words</div><div>8 September 2006</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2006 The New York Times Company.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns about the housing market deepened yesterday as the nation's leading real estate brokers' group issued a more pessimistic outlook for the year, and two major builders cut their earnings estimates by hundreds of millions of dollars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news added to a growing unease about the economy and helped drive shares on Wall Street lower for the second straight day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest report to predict a decline in the housing sector was notable for its source. The assessment from the National Association of Realtors, which has until recently been generally upbeat about the health of housing, was the group's least optimistic yet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The boom is cooling now,'' said David Lereah, the chief economist for the association, who added that falling home sales have been ''a bit worse than we had anticipated.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group said that it now expected sales to fall further than it has said in the past -- about 7.5 percent this year compared with an earlier projection of a 5 percent decline. It also said it expected prices nationwide to drop during the next few months, instead of appreciating modestly. If that happens, it would be the first time since 1993 that median home prices have fallen in any given month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revised realtors' forecast came on the heels of announcements from KB Home and Beazer, two of the nation's largest home builders, that profits this year would be lower than initially predicted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third builder, Hovnanian Enterprises, said yesterday that its third-quarter profits fell by more than a third. It left its guidance for the year unchanged.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' association said it expected both home prices and sales would slide in the coming months as the upper hand in the housing market shifts from the seller to the buyer. But that shift has yet to occur fully, with buyers and sellers staring each other down while unsold houses pile up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The seller is a lot more stubborn than any of us had anticipated,'' Mr. Lereah said. ''Sellers for the last five years have been in control. It's very hard for them to give up control and revise their expectations downward.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once sellers begin to drop their asking prices, housing industry officials hope that home sales will start to rise again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising number of homes on the market and aggressive discounting by home builders are putting pressure on sellers to lower their prices, said Ronald J. Peltier, president and chief executive of HomeServices of America, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway that owns real estate brokerage firms around the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to take the rest of this year at a minimum for that inventory to be liquidated,'' he said. ''This period of correction is going to take a little while, but it's healthy for the market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' association predicted that, at most, prices will decline for two or three months before picking back up again. For the year, home prices are still expected to appreciate, on average. Not since the Depression have home prices fallen over the course of a full year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are already signs that prices may soon start to decline nationwide. In a report issued last month, the Realtors' association said home prices in July barely inched up. The median selling price for existing homes, which rose at double-digit rates for much of the previous two years, rose only 0.9 percent compared with a year earlier. And that rise was entirely dependent on a 3 percent median price gain in the South, the only region in the country where prices did not fall.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Lonski, chief economist for Moody's Investor Service, said, ''That's got to be one of the biggest difficulties facing the sellers of real estate: the uncertainty of the durability of real estate prices into the foreseeable future.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As KB and Beazer cut their earnings guidance, they cited a growing supply of unsold homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A higher percentage of home closings are being deferred or canceled,'' Beazer said in a statement yesterday, ''immediately prior to closing in many cases, due to worsening buyer sentiment and the inability of buyers to sell their existing homes.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beazer said yesterday that it expected earnings for the year of $8 to $8.50 a share, compared with its previous outlook of $9.25 to $9.75.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KB lowered its earnings guidance for the year to $8 to $8.50 a share, down from an earlier estimate of $10 a share. That is the second time this year the builder has lowered its guidance. Other major builders like Toll Brothers and D. R. Horton have also cut their earnings forecasts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street's reaction was mixed. Shares of KB closed just 1 cent higher, at $40.40 a share, and Beazer dropped nearly 3 percent, to $37.33.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a sign that investors were expecting much worse, news of Hovnanian's profit decline helped lift shares more than 6 percent, to $27.09.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowing home sales actually helped give share prices in other sectors a lift in recent weeks. As it became clear that housing was entering a period of contraction -- in line with the Federal Reserve's expectation of an orderly economic cooling -- investors put more money into equities, betting that the Fed would not resume raising interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Aug. 1 until the beginning of this week, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index had risen more than 3 percent. But over the last two days, it has erased about half those gains.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing's decline, said Jeffrey Kleintop, a top investment strategist for PNC, ''has encouraged the stock market in the last month or two to run up.'' He added: ''The market is saying, 'Yeah, we feel pretty confident about a soft landing here.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's housing news raised questions about just how soft that landing would be. ''As an economy, we're more sensitive to housing than we've ever been,'' Mr. Kleintop said, adding that as home values have increased with the housing boom, so has individual net worth. ''Having that suddenly go away and pull into a recession really creates a big question mark.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of traditional single-family dwellings fell in 87 of the nation's 379 major metropolitan areas from the first quarter to the second, the government reported yesterday, as the overall value of homes leveled off across the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a quarterly basis, prices were lower in Boston, Sacramento, Pittsburgh and much of the Midwest, where the loss of manufacturing jobs has hit the housing market hard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, prices increased 1.2 percent in the quarter, the weakest gain in almost seven years, leaving them 10 percent higher than a year earlier, according to an index of home purchase and refinances produced by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight from mortgage data supplied by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, prices rose 2.2 percent in the first quarter and 3.7 percent in the second quarter of 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data indicates that slowing home sales and the rising number of properties for sale is forcing more sellers to reduce prices in many locations across the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price declines are spreading to more parts of the country. The 89 areas affected in the second quarter compares to 66 metropolitan areas where prices fell in the first three months of the year. In the fourth quarter last year, only 29 areas reported such declines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were lower in five states -- Michigan, Massachusetts, Maine, Ohio and Indiana -- though the declines were less than 1 percent. Just one state, Iowa, had a price decline in the first quarter and none did in the fourth quarter last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The slower sales get, and given where inventory is, it is going to require sellers to cut prices in certain markets,'' said Celia Chen, director of housing economics at Moody's Economy.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Chen noted that the index showed that prices were still rising in much of California, Arizona and Florida, states that experienced some of the biggest rises during the recent boom. But that may be in part a result of the fact that the government's home price measure does not include homes with mortgages greater than $417,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, data from the National Association of Realtors showed that the national median home price for existing homes, the price at which half sold for more and half for less, increased 0.9 percent in June from the same month a year ago. That measure, however, is not adjusted for changes in the quality and size of homes sold from one year to the next, which the government index does take account of.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, the boom in home prices has helped increase spending by allowing consumers to take out home equity loans and larger mortgages with cash out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But home equity borrowing has slowed in recent months and mortgage applications are down about 20 percent from a year ago.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REAL bubbles pop. They are fully formed one moment and gone the next. Financial bubbles rarely meet with such a definitive end, which has always been the biggest problem with the metaphor. They let out their air in unpredictable bursts, and it's usually impossible to figure out whether they have finished deflating or are just starting to.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the latest housing numbers seem like they could be a turning point. A real estate crash might not be the most likely outcome, but it certainly seems legitimate to think about what one would look like.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of building permits being issued is falling at a rate usually seen only in recessions. In July, 11 percent fewer existing homes were sold than were sold a year earlier; 22 percent fewer new houses were sold. After the new-house data was released last week, Capital Economics, a consulting firm, wrote an e-mail message to its clients that began, ''New day, same depressing housing market story.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fate of the housing market will influence whether the economy will merely slow over the next year, as the Federal Reserve forecasts, or fall into a recession for the first time since early 2001. Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, said Friday that ''for-sale'' signs had replaced gas-price signs as the most important indicator of potential trouble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapse of most bubbles does not have a single obvious starting point, like a bad corporate earnings report or an interest-rate rise. Instead, the psychology of buyers and sellers shifts, slowly at first and then sometimes in a cascade.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's always mystified people about why these things turn,'' said Robert J. Shiller, a Yale economist and author of ''Irrational Exuberance,'' a history of speculation. ''People want something concrete.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seem to be three major paths that housing could follow over the next year: a soft landing, the start of a long slump, or a crash. A soft landing is the one predicted -- and preferred -- by most economists on Wall Street and at the Fed. A long slump is what many past real estate booms turned into. A crash is the outcome that a small group of analysts say is the only possible ending for the biggest housing boom of all.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their prediction looks better than it did a few weeks ago, but even they aren't sure whether this is the beginning of the end or another false turning point. ''The funny thing about bubbles,'' Mr. Shiller said, ''is that you never know when they're over.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a crash to happen, prices would have to decline significantly in some once-hot markets. So far, as sales have slowed and the number of houses on the market has soared, many owners have chosen to sit tight. If they were instead to decide that selling later would be even worse than selling now, this could change quickly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doomsayers' strongest argument may be that too few families can afford prices in some metropolitan areas. In Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Miami, prices have almost doubled since 2003, and they have risen about 50 percent in New York and San Francisco, the National Association of Realtors says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumps of this magnitude have little precedent. To afford homes, some buyers, especially in California, have resorted to aggressive mortgages, like those that allow artificially low payments in the early years. In effect, families seem to be buying houses they cannot afford, in the hope that their incomes or property values will rise significantly. ''Prices just shot up too much,'' said Robert T. McGee, chief economist at U.S. Trust, an investment firm based in New York. The firm has forecast a soft landing for housing, he said, but ''as time goes by that starts to look like wishful thinking.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If prices do decline, some of the first victims would be families in a financial bind that are unable to rescue themselves by refinancing their mortgage. Foreclosures would then rise, damaging banks and increasing the number of homes for sale.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even homeowners not in danger of losing their home -- an overwhelming majority, certainly -- might respond to falling prices by cutting spending, particularly if they had been counting on their home's value to serve as a retirement account. That could force job cuts in a wide range of industries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, the housing slowdown has begun damaging the job market. Builders, mortgage lenders and real estate agencies have stopped adding to payrolls. Defined broadly, the real estate sector has accounted for 44 percent of jobs created since 2000 and employs more than one in 10 American workers, according to Moody's Economy.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the biggest reason to be skeptical about a real estate crash is that the country has not really suffered through one before. Not since the Depression has the combined value of residential real estate fallen over the course of a full year. Homes seem to be much less vulnerable to crashes than other assets, because people rarely sell them in a panic.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But earlier booms have been followed by modest price declines in some cities that turned into long periods in which increases trailed inflation. After peaking in much of California and the Northeast in the late 1980's, house values fell during the recession of 1990-91 and then drifted for years, often rising more slowly than the price of milk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In inflation-adjusted terms, prices in the New York and Washington areas did not return to their late-80's peak until 2002. In Boston, it didn't happen until 2000, and in San Francisco, 1999.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't hard to imagine a similar chain of events over the next decade. Based on futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, investors expect the median house price in Los Angeles, New York and some other regions to fall about 5 percent in the next year, which would be similar to the decline that started the 90's slump.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From there, prices might start rising again, but at a slow enough pace that incomes would eventually catch up. Families that now need an exotic mortgage to buy a house in Los Angeles could eventually afford one the old-fashioned way.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates could play a role in a long slump, too. They have been falling for much of the last decade, helping push house prices higher by allowing buyers to afford bigger mortgages. Most economists expect rates to remain lower than they were a generation ago but not to return to the extremely low levels of a few years ago, making big swings in house prices, in either direction, unlikely.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher J. Mayer, director of the Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at Columbia University, argues that the recent drop in sales does not suggest that a larger bust is coming. ''So far we have only seen people asking pie-in-the-sky asking prices and not getting them,'' said Mr. Mayer, who expects housing to continue slowing but not enough to create a recession.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes that the boom in house prices was largely a result of the appeal of ''superstar cities'' like New York and San Francisco that are unlikely to lose their allure. In the much of the rest of the country, prices are not unusually high, considering the relatively low interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, few borrowers are falling behind on their mortgage payments, and the economy looks fairly healthy outside of housing. So if prices start falling, new buyers may jump into the market and prevent any extended slump. ''The fundamentals of real estate are solid, still,'' said James Gillespie, chief executive of Coldwell Banker, the real estate company.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is it, then -- a brief pause, or a big correction?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Either argument is very compelling. I can debate myself on it,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. ''That's why there's a great deal of uncertainty.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''A History of Home Values''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Yale economist Robert J. Shiller created an index of American housing prices going back to 1890. It is based on sale prices of standard existing houses, not new construction, to track the value of housing as an investment over time. It presents housing values in consistent terms over 116 years, factoring out the effects of inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1890 benchmark is 100 on the chart. If a standard house sold in 1890 for $100,000 (inflation- adjusted to today's dollars), an equivalent standard house would have sold for $66,000 in 1920 (66 on the index scale) and $199,000 in 2006 (199 on the index scale, or 99 percent higher than 1890).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DECLINE AND RUN-UP -- Prices dropped as mass production techniques appeared early in the 20th century. Prices spiked with post-war housing demand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOOM TIMES -- Two gains in recent decades were followed by returns to levels consistent since the late 1950's. Since 1997, the index has risen about 83 percent.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYERS are said to have the upper hand these days in the market for residential real estate, and this is reflected in the elaborate presents and price breaks that consumers are being offered to purchase homes in new developments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Ocean Acres at Barnegat development, where hundreds of single-family homes are being built near Barnegat Bay, several buyers await delivery of new Toyota Yaris hatchbacks, which will arrive in their garages early next year at the time of their closings, courtesy of the developer, Walters Homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, in the Poconos, the Teicher Organization was giving away new Mazda Miata convertibles to those who signed contracts on the weekend when sales opened for its new Mystic Pines Townhomes development at the Pinecrest Lake Golf and Country Club.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Devonshire, a new development of 68 estate-style homes in Monroe, buyers are being guaranteed a 30-year mortgage with a rate of only 6 percent, with the rate locked in until closing -- plus a minimum of $20,000 in cash and six months without mortgage payments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That interest rate compares with a average rate of 6.6 percent for a 30-year mortgage in New Jersey as of Aug. 18. On a $600,000 loan, the lower interest rate would bring down the monthly mortgage payment by about $235 a month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program at Devonshire is promoted by the developer, Matzel &amp; Mumford, as providing ''peace of mind'' for buyers in the development, which has four- and five-bedroom homes priced from $694,900. The below-market-interest-rate incentive is scheduled to expire at the end of the month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other companies continue to come up with new ideas to entice potential homeowners to set aside their anxiety about climbing mortgage interest rates and buy now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kaplan Companies of Highland Park, for one, appears to be going to unusual lengths to persuade prospective buyers that they have nothing to lose by making a purchase. For the next 60 home buyers at its current New Jersey projects -- Towne Lake and Harbour Pointe at La Mer, both in Sayreville; the Heights of Hampton; the Woodfield at Mount Olive; the Villages at Cinnaminson Harbour; and the Ambiance at Hackensack -- the company is offering a plan intended to provide full protection against the vagaries of the housing market over the next three years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will buy back any home we sell -- at the price paid -- at any time in the next three years, should the market price of that home fall,'' said Jason Kaplan, president of the Kaplan Companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kaplan also promises to pay closing costs for home buyers who want to refinance their mortgages during the next three years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For potential buyers who may be having difficulty selling a home they currently own, Kaplan is offering to buy the house. And for those who are renters and need to break a lease, it is offering to pay the cost of doing so.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the company is holding out a safety net to buyers who lose their jobs within the next three years. In the event of that disaster, Kaplan will pay the mortgage for up to one full year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As always with eyebrow-raising offers, certain conditions apply. For example, there is the matter of setting a price for a customer's current house. ''We will buy at market price, based on comps'' -- sales prices for comparable homes in the same neighborhood -- ''factoring in a real estate broker's commission,'' Mr. Kaplan said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But given that the market slowed markedly last spring, producing an eight-month backlog of homes for sale around the state, Kaplan's offer removes the significant burden of having to wait to sell in order to buy, Mr. Kaplan said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a soft market for sellers, but a strong market for buyers right now,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''We really wanted to get the attention of buyers.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just bought my own house'' in Short Hills, Mr. Kaplan said, ''and I was able to negotiate the price, while I know that a year ago I would have been just another one of those bidding on it, which was crazy.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kaplan said the biggest concern of people looking at Kaplan's various communities of single-family homes and town homes right now seems to be: If I buy now, will the value of the home hold up?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are confident that the homes we build are priced right, and that nothing drastic is happening with the market,'' he said. ''We are basically just putting our name and wallet behind it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kaplan, like other large home building companies in New Jersey, has houses for sale in many places and price ranges -- and Mr. Kaplan said the market situation appears similar across the board.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any product, any price, any geographical area of New Jersey,'' he said, ''if stuff is overpriced, people are just not buying. If it is priced right, then it will move.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting prices for Kaplan's condominiums at the Villages at Cinnaminson Harbour, along the Delaware River in Burlington County, are set in the low $200,000's, mid-$200,000's and low $300,000's, for three different designs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The units at the Harbour Pointe at La Mer, which all have two bedrooms and two baths, are priced from the mid-$300,000's. Condos at the Ambiance at Hackensack are priced from the low $400,000's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family homes and larger town homes at the Heights of Hampton, Woodfield at Mount Olive and Towne Lake have prices starting in the $500,000's, Mr. Kaplan said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photos: PROMOTING 'PEACE OF MIND' -- At the Devonshire in Monroe, top, buyers are being guaranteed a 30-year mortgage with a rate of only 6 percent; at Towne Lake in Sayreville, bottom, the builder will buy back any home within three years.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF you raise prices enough, people will stop buying.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may not impress economists as a new thought, but it accurately describes the current United States home market, where home buyers are suddenly more reluctant to put down their money, and the supply of homes for sale has reached record levels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing boom that now appears to have ended was most pronounced in a handful of areas largely concentrated on the East and West Coasts, while people in the Midwest wondered what all the excitement was about. Now it is the areas that did the best that are seeing the most buyer resistance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In three states, the rate of home sales in the second quarter of this year fell by more than a quarter from a year earlier. All are in warm-weather areas, all were viewed as likely to gain population as baby boomers retired and all enjoyed rapid price rises in the first half of the current decade, in part because of speculation by investors seeking quick profits. They are California, Florida and Arizona.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While those states had the largest decline in sales rates, the six other states along with the District of Columbia that led the country in sales price increases early in the decade are now also experiencing sales declines more rapid than those in the nation as a whole. They include Hawaii and Nevada, two other areas that had intrigued investors, as well as the region that benefited from the growth of the federal government in this decade: Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the other end of the list are the 10 states with the smallest home price gains from 2000 to 2005. In six of them the pace of sales has risen this year, notwithstanding the national trend, and another three have had declines that are smaller than the national average.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best of those 10 is Texas, where the pace of sales in the second quarter of 2006 was up 11 percent from a year earlier, and at a record high. Texas has benefited from a trend that may have hurt home sales in most areas: rising oil prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state where higher oil prices are perhaps the worst news is Michigan, home of an automobile industry that bet on the continued growth of sales of sport utility vehicles. Home prices did not rise much there early in the decade, but now the pace of sales is falling at a double-digit rate, worse than in the rest of the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Put another way, the pace of home sales in Michigan is almost exactly where it was in late 1997, while the national sales rate is still 46 percent above the figure then. In Texas, the gain over that period is 83 percent. Over that same period, the price of a barrel of crude oil has soared to $72 from $18.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the first part of this decade, it was the so-called blue states, the ones that elect Democrats, that were more likely to see big home price increases. If those that rose the most then are now to suffer the most, it will be the blue states that do the worst in the housing downturn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the states where home prices rose more than the national average from 2000 to 2005, John Kerry won 155 electoral votes in 2004, compared with just 55 for President Bush. But among states where home prices rose less than the national average, Mr. Bush gained 231 electoral votes to just 97 for Mr. Kerry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''Searching for Buyers''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of single-family homes for sale in the United States reached a record 3.8 million in July, up 37 percent from a year earlier, as sales have also slowed. The biggest declines in sales have come in the states where prices had risen the most. In all the 10 states with the biggest price gains from 2000 to 2005, sales of existing homes have fallen more rapidly than they have in the nation as a whole. In 9 of the 10 with the smallest price gains, recent sales trends were better than the national average.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are falling rapidly, and the number of houses on the market is surging. Yet each new economic report offering evidence of a housing slowdown also shows that the national median home price has continued to rise over the last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand how this could be happening, consider a three-bedroom house surrounded by oak and redwood trees, not far from the Golden Gate Bridge, in San Rafael, Calif. Reluctant to cut the price from its current listing of $1.54 million, its owners are instead offering a weeklong vacation time-share, every year for life, worth about $10,000, or an equal amount toward lease of a car.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Location and value will give the buyers a reason -- this will give them a sense of urgency,'' said Tom Wessling, who owns the house with his wife, Brenda, and is being transferred to Atlanta. ''If nothing else, it will be the thing that calls attention'' to the house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, the Northeast, South Florida and parts of the Southwest, deal sweeteners like these are playing an increasingly important role in supporting home prices. From large national home builders to individual homeowners, many sellers are offering thousands of dollars in perks, including straight cash, so they do not have to slice deeply into asking prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these discounts are almost entirely missing from the statistics on new-home prices reported by the government and on existing-home prices reported by the National Association of Realtors. As a result, home prices may now be falling, despite what the official numbers show, many economists say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The use of rebates helps home builders and individual sellers by making the real estate market look healthier than it may truly be and by preventing a snowballing decline in home prices. It also keeps commissions for real estate agents higher than they would otherwise be.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the national median price -- half sold for more and half for less -- of a newly built home was $230,000, the Commerce Department said yesterday. That is 0.3 percent higher than the median price a year ago. The number of new-home sales fell 21.6 percent over the last year, with the sharpest drop occurring in the Northeast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Realtor group reported that the median price of existing homes was also $230,000 in July, up 0.9 percent from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's Economy.com, estimated that incentives might now be equal to as much as 3 percent of the effective prices of houses across the country, on average. But he and other economists said there was simply no way to know for certain.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have any house price indexes that get it right,'' said Todd Sinai, an associate professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sellers are pretty picky,'' he added. ''They are not willing to lower prices enough in downturns; they don't do it very quickly.'' Their reluctance delays sales, contributes to rising inventories and allows prices on the remaining transactions to show an annual increase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incentives are most common in the new-home market, where builders are under financial pressure to sell empty homes and, as large businesses, have the ability to absorb the financial hit. Depending on the market, executives at the nation's biggest builders say the giveaways can equal 3 percent to 8 percent of a home's sale price. If builders instead reduced asking prices by that much, it would be enough to wipe out the year-over-year price gains in many markets. Last year, by contrast, many builders were selling out new subdivisions and condominiums in hours or days, often in auctions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you were going to sell the house exactly the way it was before, you would be looking at a price decline,'' said David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a sign of the housing market's deterioration, creative -- and expensive -- lures are also becoming more common in the existing-home market. With many houses languishing on the market for months, buyers often have the leverage to request a last-minute concession of a few thousand dollars, or more, as a prerequisite to a sale. The subsidy often comes in the form of a discount on the amount of cash a seller must pay at closing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's using a little psychology,'' said Frank Borges LLosa , who owns Frankly Realty in northern Virginia, an agency that mainly represents buyers. ''It makes it sometimes appear like I'm offering a higher price.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. LLosa recently analyzed records for condominiums in one Virginia ZIP code and found that the use of subsidies had soared since last year, when they were almost nonexistent. In Arlington, 14 condominiums had sold for $350,000 to $550,000 since June 1, and 10 of them included a subsidy from the seller to the buyer. The average subsidy was more than $7,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wesslings of San Rafael have cut the price of their house twice, by a total of $160,000, since they put it on the market in May. Mr. Wessling, a marketing executive, believes the home is now ''competitively priced'' and hopes the perks, which also include a $10,000 reward for referring a qualified buyer, will be enough to clinch a deal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi, the economist, said he believed that the use of perks was now approaching its peak and that sellers would soon be forced to cut list prices more heavily. He predicted that the home-price data released by the Realtors association would show a year-over-year decline, relative to the same month a year earlier, before the end of this year. If so, that would be the first such drop since 1993. The Realtors have never reported a drop in the annual average of national home prices, a fact frequently cited by real estate analysts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reason the Realtors' data has never showed an outright decline'' before, he said, ''might be that they're not measuring the effective price.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, a senior economist with the Realtors group, said that in markets where inventories had been rising rapidly -- like the Northeast and California -- incentives could well equal 3 percent of house values. But he estimated that the national number was smaller, because homes sales were continuing to rise in roughly a third of markets around the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The typical incentive package from a home builder consists of upgrades to the house -- granite countertops instead of humdrum tiles, stainless-steel refrigerators and stoves instead of plain white models and wood blinds instead of plastic. At the extremes, some have thrown in $30,000 swimming pools.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who demand discounts often get them in the form of excused closing costs or low interest rate loans made by builder-affiliated mortgage companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the west coast of Florida, builders are advertising incentives like upgraded countertops, interest rate promotions and cash rebates totaling $40,000, or 6.6 percent to 8 percent of the sales price, on homes that sell for $500,000 to $600,000, said John Dew, a real estate agent in Naples.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders tend to choose discounts because they worry that reductions in the list price would send a clear signal that the market is in trouble, potentially angering previous buyers and emboldening future customers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They already sold the same product to the guy next door and if they reduce the price he is going to scream,'' Mr. Dew said. He added that many builders were also offering agents bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars in finders' fees for bringing in buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In effect, the incentives have become a quiet way to cut the price of houses without further damaging the market. Sellers ''don't want to create this environment of fear in the market that prices are going down, so you should wait to buy,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic Policy Research in Washington, who believes that prices will fall in coming years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incentives are often most substantial on homes built on speculation before a sales contract has been signed, or on properties that buyers have walked away from after signing a contract. Big builders report that cancellation rates are running as high as a third of new sales, compared with about 20 percent or less a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulte Homes, for instance, was recently offering unspecified incentives totaling as much as $10,000 on homes in a Connecticut development to buyers who were willing to move in before school started. In the spring, Centex Homes ran a ''24-hour sale'' in Southern California where buyers who agreed to purchase within the day could get a $100,000 discount. It ran a similar offer for a $60,000 discount in Atlanta.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders are also wary of incentives. Lenders do not want to finance transactions where the sales price exceeds the true value of the home. Fannie Mae, the large buyer of mortgages, requires disclosure of perks and it caps them on a sliding scale from 2 percent to 9 percent of selling prices, depending on whether buyers will live in the home and based on the size of the down payment. The concerns of lenders will eventually limit the size of incentives in home sales, said Anthony Hsieh, president of LendingTree.com, the Web loan site. Many buyers may also balk because their property taxes will be based on the sales price listed on the contract.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, buyers will realize ''there is no free lunch,'' he said. ''There is a reason it's being given away.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is deteriorating by the month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest and strongest indication that the home buying and selling frenzy is over, the National Association of Realtors reported yesterday that sales of previously owned homes fell to the lowest level in July in more than two years, prices flattened and sellers waited longer and longer to find buyers for their homes. The supply of unsold houses on the market hit a record high.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the data showed the housing market was following the traditional path of a slowdown: a drop in sales followed by a decline or a plateau in prices. But they remained divided over just how severe and long-lasting the coming slump was likely to be.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It does feel a little scary right now,'' said Celia Chen, director of housing economics at Moody's Economy.com. ''I think these markets will correct. The price gains that they have seen have exceeded what can be supported by the economic and demographic fundamentals.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in July declined 4.1 percent from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.3 million, the slowest selling pace since early 2004, when sales were running at a rate as low as 6 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had a hot market, and now it's going to be back to normal,'' said Edward Leamer, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''Sales volumes will continue to decline, although they'll bottom out sometime in the next year.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median selling price for existing homes, which rose at double-digit rates for much of the previous two years, was up only slightly last month. And had home prices not continued to rise in the South, where they gained slightly more than 3 percent compared with a year earlier, the national rate would have fallen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the second consecutive month, the median price of an existing home in July rose 0.9 percent from a year earlier, to $230,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Certainly, the housing market is undergoing a measurable adjustment,'' Lawrence Yun, senior economist with the Realtor association, said. ''It's a continuing cooling trend.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of unsold homes on the market reached a record for the second consecutive month. There are now enough homes available that it would take 7.3 months to sell them all if the current selling rate held.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bloated inventory levels, Mr. Yun said, indicate ''a very sudden change which I have never seen before.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown means that housing, the sector of the economy that has helped carry the country through a period of rapid expansion, now could act as a drag on growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists, including the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, still expect the slowdown to be orderly. But with homebuilders reporting a sharp pullback in interest in new homes, existing-home sales in many local markets now look set to weaken at least a while longer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's data showed that prices fell in most areas of the country. Only in the South are prices still rising: the median home there sold for 3.2 percent more last month than a year earlier. If prices there had not been so strong, the national median home price in July would have declined on a year-over-year basis. That has not happened since April 1995.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's a good indication of an unexpected decline in demand,'' said Michael Carney, a professor of finance and real estate at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales and price declines were most pronounced on the East and West Coasts, where the housing market had overheated the most. In the Northeast, where median existing-home prices rose last year by 10.7 percent, prices fell 2.1 percent in July from the same month in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in the Northeast fell 5.4 percent from the previous month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the West, which is dominated by California, prices fell 0.3 percent in July. Last year, they rose 17.7 percent. Sales in the region declined 6.4 percent last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices are sliding, most economists are still predicting that they will not fall very far.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The trend here is one of stabilizing prices after the sharp gains seen for many years,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist with MFR, wrote in a research note yesterday. ''While certainly a change in trend, so far the official data are not corroborating some of the more alarmist stories being bandied about recently.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors saw yesterday's housing data as a reason to pull down shares of major real estate companies and homebuilders. KB Homes, the builder, and Realogy, the country's biggest residential real estate broker, which was recently spun off from Cendant, lost the most of any stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index yesterday. Shares of KB fell 6 percent, and shares of Realogy fell 5 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realogy told investors that its earnings for the year would be lower than previously expected. Earlier this week, Toll Brothers, the largest luxury-home builder in the country, also said it would earn less money this year.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of unsold homes on the market, after hitting a record in June, climbed even higher last month.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''In the Region'' article in some copies last Sunday about recent trends in home sales in New Jersey misstated the county for Short Hills. It is Essex County, not Morris.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Aug 20 2006   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NEW analysis of housing sales over the first six months of the year shows a much weaker market: volume dipped by 17 percent statewide and the inventory of unsold homes rose by 70 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are currently enough homes on the market to satisfy overall demand for the next eight months, by the reckoning of Jeffrey Otteau of the Otteau Appraisal Group, a company that advises real estate sales agents and trains them to deal with market conditions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices have not plummeted, and experts do not expect that they will.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broken down by price category, there is a seven-month supply of homes priced at less than $600,000, an 11-month supply of houses priced at $600,000 to $1 million, and a 16-month supply of dwellings listed for more than $1 million, according to Mr. Otteau's latest report, which was issued at the end of last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers were starker in some counties. In Cumberland County and Salem County, there was a 70-month supply of houses for sale in both the over-$600,000 and the over-$1 million bracket, even though Cumberland was the only one of the 21 counties in New Jersey that showed an increase in the number of sales from January through June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in counties where sales have been consistently buoyant in the last decade, Mr. Otteau's statistics reflected markets gone limp: In Bergen County, sales were down 14 percent in the first half of this year from a year earlier, and inventory as of June 30 was up 85 percent; in Essex County, sales were down 14 percent and inventory was up 50 percent; in Hudson County, sales were down 15 percent and inventory was up 73 percent; in Monmouth County, sales were down 16 percent and inventory was up 57 percent; and in Morris County sales were down 18 percent and inventory was up 66 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many real estate sales agents, though, said that the statistics sound worse than the reality.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I remember selling a condo in West Orange in 1986 for $288,000,'' said Ken Baris, president of Jordan Baris Inc. Realtors. ''Then, when the market really did drop, I sold the same unit again in 1993 -- for $150,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That condo today -- a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath unit at Eagle Ridge -- would sell for close to $400,000,'' he said. ''It gained tremendously in value over these boom years, and while its value might be down a bit from the peak of the home-buying frenzy, there is no crash in the marketplace, or bursting bubble, or anything remotely like that.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baris said there is simply no chance, in his opinion, that the value of the condo he cited might drop as sharply as it did 15 years ago because, he said, ''this market just isn't like that'' for a variety of reasons.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau's report to subscribing real estate brokerage firms keeps track of signed contract sales in all 21 counties. ''Given that the New Jersey housing market realized an 87 percent increase in home prices from 2000 to 2005, the adjustments now taking place come as no surprise,'' said Mr. Otteau, referring to asking prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He predicted a ''bumpy ride'' over the next few years if mortgage interest rates continue to rise, along with energy prices, and buyers and sellers struggle to assess the impact on home values.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is mounting evidence,'' he wrote in his report, ''that home prices will decline over the short term as motivated sellers make decisions to accept a lower selling price in exchange for a quicker sale.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, new home builders are starting to provide significant concessions to buyers, like subsidizing mortgage interest or making one or more mortgage payments, he noted. Those steps have the effect of lowering the effective price of the houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baris and other brokers said many sellers are having difficulty accepting the idea that they missed the moment when houses were selling for prices that had previously seemed far-fetched.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When the market was really going crazy, we had a lot of people who said they wanted to wait for the peak to put their homes up for sale,'' said Mr. Baris, who runs his West Orange-based firm with his father, Jordan Baris. ''We always told them, 'You won't know the peak until it's passed.' But a lot of people don't believe it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maureen Doyle, who manages the Morristown office of ReMax, said a large majority of the houses on the market are now sold for less than the asking price, or only after the asking price has been reduced, perhaps even more than once -- steps that had been rare for the past few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Certainly, there are houses selling for full price -- or even a little over'' -- if they are priced competitively, she said. ''That's the trick.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks ago, she said, she sold two houses, one for more than the asking price and the other for the asking price -- which was the highest of three bids.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Last year, if you got three bids on a house, the lowest one would be for the asking price,'' she said. ''Still, three bids is great.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Doyle said she made a rule in her office some years ago that if a house did not sell within 21 days, the price should come down. If a homeowner balked, she said, ''that's a stubborn seller.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In light of the glut of houses on the market, though, Mrs. Doyle said she had increased the time a house could sit on the market without serious buyers showing up, and extended the waiting time before a price cut to a month or five weeks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the exclusive community of Short Hills, in Morris County, Mrs. Doyle's ReMax colleague, Jane Goetz, still sees the glass as half full.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yes, buyers are being more selective,'' she observed. ''Buyers are looking less at houses that need work, and seem to want it all done.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, she said, she was representing the seller of a Victorian home that she called ''an architectural masterpiece,'' but that needs updating. It would have sold within a week last year, she said. Now, it has been awaiting serious interest for more than a month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, Ms. Goetz said, she has a buyer who is willing to spend from $1.8 million to $4 million to buy the right house in Short Hills or Summit, and she has not been able to find something appropriate. ''Believe it or not, there's not a lot out there right now,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baris said that looking at the increase in the percentage of unsold homes can be misleading. ''In the early 90's, when the market was really low, there were 600 houses on the market in West Orange,'' he said. ''At one point about two years ago, at the peak of the frenzy, for the first time ever in modern history probably, there were under 100 houses for sale in West Orange.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He estimated that there are now 200 houses on the market there, double the number of two years ago, and perhaps up 40 or 50 percent in the last six months. ''I think that really does sound worse than it is,'' he said, ''The market was so crazy hot for a while that everything looks bad compared to it.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WESTHAMPTON, N.Y. -- The brand new 6,000-square-foot vacation home, backing on a boat dock on Moriches Bay, has been on the market for more than a year. After plenty of showings, but no offers, the investor who built the house recently cut the price twice, by a total of $600,000, to $4 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has still not been sold. To be sure, the price reductions have created more interest, according to the agent representing the owner, and he now hopes that it will be sold right after Labor Day, a prime season for home transactions in the Hamptons.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My feeling is that everybody is waiting for the dust to settle before they make their big decision,'' said the agent, Ira Birns of Prudential Douglas Elliman. But, he acknowledged ruefully, ''there is a lot to choose from.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just the most expensive vacation homes that are going begging. The once-bustling deal making in a wide variety of popular locations for second homes -- areas like Florida, the Jersey Shore and Lake Tahoe, as well as the high-price playground on the East End of Long Island -- has slowed markedly in recent months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the overall housing market weakens, the interest in buying vacation homes, from the most modest condominiums on up, appears to be falling faster. Unlike most metropolitan areas -- where underlying demand and the normal turnover in primary homes as a result of job moves, new households and family changes provide a more solid floor under prices -- the second-home market relies on a different set of motivations that tends to exaggerate booms and busts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Second-home buying is very discretionary,'' said Edward Leamer, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''There is no force of demographics that is pushing people into buying homes as there is in primary home markets.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In second-home markets around the country, the number of sales is shrinking even as the properties on the market increase. Prices at all levels are softening, and in a few places recently have begun dropping.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Florida, price declines have been most pronounced in areas dominated by second-home sales. In June, median prices -- half the homes sold for more and half for less -- fell 8 percent from a year earlier in Naples and nearby Marco Island on the west coast and 10 percent in Panama City in the Panhandle, according to the Florida Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, prices rose 3 percent statewide, 4 percent in Miami and 10 percent in Orlando. (In addition to the overbuilding factor, rapidly rising insurance premiums tied to the greater risk of hurricane damage have hurt home sales in many coastal areas of Florida.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul J. Ciotti, 60, a retired New York teacher, has had his two-bedroom beachfront condominium in Naples on the market since late last year. He first asked $999,000, when ''everybody was going for pie in the sky.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[He has since cut the price to $799,000, which he says is a bargain because there is little undeveloped beachfront property left in Naples. ''The beachfront is still much stronger,'' he said. ''It always will be.'']  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the market's strength will be tested this fall, there is little doubt that waterfront property has had a nice run in Naples and elsewhere. Mr. Ciotti's apartment sold for $153,000 in 1987 when the building opened; he bought it for $515,000 in 2004, according to county property records.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom, prices in regions with a heavy concentration of second-home sales rose higher and faster than elsewhere, an analysis by Moody's Economy.com of national mortgage and housing data showed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, the latest year for which data is available, Ocean City, N.J., at 73 percent, headed the list of metropolitan areas with high shares of second homes. From 2002 to 2005, home prices in the area, which includes Cape May, rose at an average annual rate of 17 percent, compared with 10 percent for the nation as a whole and 14 percent for New Jersey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These have been the most juiced-up markets,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this spring and summer, median home prices in the Ocean City area have fallen by 10 to 15 percent from a year earlier. Sales have slowed and more houses are sitting on the market, according to Nicholas J. Marotta, president of the Ocean City Board of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He blames speculators for rapidly inflating and then depressing the market by trading in condominiums and oceanfront homes that they bought with low-interest loans requiring only small down payments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A local developer added that new construction had flooded the market, with more than 100 homes priced at $2 million or more. ''We believed in our own confidence,'' said the developer, Raffaele Pansini, who has been building homes for nine years. ''And in a way, we proved ourselves wrong because we don't have 100 buyers coming in.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like others in the area, he predicted that demand would eventually catch up but that this could take some time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, increased worries about rising interest rates, higher energy costs and a slowing economy have left some prospective buyers queasy about investing in a second or third property.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the experience of Shari Chase, whose real estate firm, Chase International, specializes in the Lake Tahoe winter ski and summer recreation area that straddles the California-Nevada border. Sales fell 35 percent in the first six months of 2006 from the period a year earlier. Prices eked out a 2 percent increase, according to DataQuick Information Systems, a research firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacation homes, like other luxury items, are frequently caught up in booms that appear to defy gravity. But they depend on a relatively narrow slice of the population, mostly affluent baby boomers, leaving them vulnerable to sudden downturns.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a number of vacation homes are bought with cash, mortgage data suggests that second homes made up about 14 percent of all home sales in 2004, up from 8.4 percent in 2001.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey of consumer finances conducted every three years by the Federal Reserve found that the overall interest in second homes tends to closely follow the ups and downs of the economic cycle. In 1989, some 13.4 percent of those responding said they owned a second home, but that figure fell during the recession in the early 1990's and reached a low point of 11.9 percent in 1995. Such ownership rose to 13 percent in 1998 but fell back to 11.4 percent in 2001 before rising again to 12.6 percent in 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anecdotal evidence suggests that vacation homes might have reached a new high-water mark in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I saw a lot of clients buy first, and ask questions later, on second and third properties,'' said Leo P. Grohowski, chief investment officer at U.S. Trust, which caters to affluent families.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of Florida and the Jersey Shore, areas considerably more affordable than the Hamptons, have been favored destinations lately for his well-to-do clients and friends, many of whom encouraged Mr. Grohowski to buy with them. He is happy that he resisted, he said, though ''for a while, I was looking like a dummy.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate experts note that second-home markets have a natural self-correcting mechanism. However much local people may believe in their particular slice of paradise, destinations can price themselves out of the market. Plenty of people are willing to pay more for waterfront property, privacy and pristine vistas, but no region has a monopoly on those features.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a very efficient market,'' said Richard A. Smith, vice chairman and president of Realogy, the former real estate arm of Cendant that owns Coldwell Banker and Sotheby's International Realty. ''When you don't like the pricing someplace, you can go someplace else.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the market for high luxury, homes costing more than $5 million, tends to be more resilient, said George R. Simpson, president of the Suffolk Research Service, a firm that monitors the real estate market in the East End of Long Island.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a market that is driven by ego and wannabes,'' he said. ''People come here because it's the thing to do. Every time P. Diddy has a cocktail party, the prices go up a little.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But data collected by Mr. Simpson's firm shows that even the Hamptons are not impervious to weakness. Median home prices in East Hampton and Southampton, including the surrounding villages and hamlets, languished in the low $200,000's for most of the 1990's. Adjusted for inflation, prices did not climb past their 1990 levels until the end of the decade.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for the first six months of 2006, median prices are up 4 percent in Southampton, to $766,000, and 13 percent in East Hampton, to $900,000, according to Suffolk Research, though some of that could reflect a shift in sales toward the top of the market. The number of sales, however, is down 14 percent in Southampton and 19 percent in East Hampton.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although agents insist that nothing akin to the 1990's slump is setting in, they are spending more time promoting properties and hand-holding sellers -- exercises considered unnecessary when homes were moving in a week or so and bidding wars were common.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, Elisabeth Mills, an East Hampton agent who works at the Corcoran Group, started showing a commercial on cable television for a $2.3 million modern home, down from $2.5 million, and another home, built on speculation and offered at $1.99 million. The second property is in a neighborhood where the fashion designer Donna Karan and the rap star and entrepreneur P. Diddy live.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mills is paying for the 30-second spot, which pans through the interiors and exteriors of the homes and is being shown on CNBC, HGTV and a local cable news channel in Suffolk County, in hopes that it will create extra buzz among agents and potential buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Response to the ad has been ''pretty amazing,'' she said, particularly from other builders looking for ways to market their own homes. ''We seem to have increased activity from brokers,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Priestley, who built the larger house in the ad, said the marketing campaign for the property also includes direct mail and open houses (wine and cheese on Saturdays; bagels and coffee on Sundays) -- all in an effort to set his home apart from others. He says he is confident it will be sold by Labor Day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are still plenty of buyers,'' Mr. Priestly said. ''We have 20 to 30 people showing up every time we have an open house.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''Home Sweet Second Home''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For much of this decade prices in the Hamptons, like several other second-home markets, have risen sharply. But price increases are slowing and some experts now predict a period of weakness. In the 1990's nominal prices were flat, and they fell in inflation-adjusted dollars.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During real estate booms, like that in the early 2000's, prices tend to rise faster in markets with a large share of vacation homes. Second homes made up a big percentage of home mortgages issued in 2004 in the metropolitan areas below.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE American Dream Downpayment Initiative, a federal assistance program for first-time home buyers begun in 2003, failed to distribute more than half of the $211 million it had been allocated by the end of last year, according to a recent report by the federal Government Accountability Office, and far less than originally envisioned by the Bush administration.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem, the accountability office found, is that housing costs are so high in many areas that the grants offered under the program are still not enough to help low-income first-time buyers afford a house or condominium.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The gap that has to be bridged between the subsidy and what's needed for a down payment is often so great that the grants can't begin to fill it,'' said David Wood, author of the report. He did not find fault with the program specifically, but ''a whole lot of subsidies have to be accumulated from different sources to help some of these people become homeowners,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is most pronounced, of course, in areas with high housing costs and a large number of low-income households. In particular the report cited Los Angeles County; the median house price in the area was $568,400 in the last quarter of 2005, the latest figures available from the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of early this year, the City of Los Angeles had used the program to help 32 home buyers at an average of less than $5,400 each. By June, according to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, the city had spent just $172,000 of the $5 million it had been allotted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of homes bought by applicants in Los Angeles was $264,000, and the median mortgage amount was about $142,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fund regulations stipulate that applicants can receive $10,000 or 6 percent of the purchase price, whichever is higher. But then there are also income ceilings for the program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A representative of the Los Angeles Housing Department said that people who qualify often cannot afford a monthly mortgage payment high enough to buy a house there. For example, a family of four must have an annual household income of $55,450 or less to receive down-payment help in Los Angeles. But even with a down payment of $100,000 on a $300,000 house, this family would still not be able to afford the monthly mortgage payment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Department of Housing and Urban Development defended the program's performance, and said that spending had increased since the accountability office's report.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Sullivan, a department spokesman, said that as of the end of June, about 54 percent of the money had been disbursed to home buyers across the nation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're very encouraged that for a brand-new federal program, more than half of the funds have been spent,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''This program is helping to cultivate a culture of home-buyer assistance across this country that is not insignificant.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sullivan also pointed out that more than 17,000 low-income applicants had used money from the program to buy houses since money was first released to states in June 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that number is considerably lower than envisioned in December 2003, when President Bush signed the bill authorizing the program. He said at the time that ''as many as 40,000 low-income families'' would benefit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 40,000 figure was based partly on the $200 million annually that Congress initially authorized for the program, which is set to expire next year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rather than $800 million over its four-year life, Congress has actually allocated only $236 million.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LYNN AND FRANK BALDUCCI'S house in Bethpage, N.Y., should be a real estate agent's dream: 4br, 2ba, large new EIK, formal LR, family room, new roof and siding, move-in condition.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Balduccis put their 1951 colonial on the market in early May. They held seven open houses, drawing 10 or so potential buyers, but they still had not gotten a single offer as of early August -- even after they dropped their asking price to $539,000 from $589,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very depressing,'' Ms. Balducci said, adding that at least seven houses in her neighborhood had been on the market for at least as long as theirs. ''It's a little scary for us, too, because we very shortly may be in a position where we have to carry two mortgages.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Balduccis, who have a 3 1/2-month-old girl, Emily, are moving to get more space as well as a waterfront location; they have bought a house on a canal off Seaford Creek in Massapequa and are scheduled to close on it in a few weeks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Balduccis' agent, Peggy Chugkowski, with Prudential Douglas Elliman in Massapequa, tells a story that is becoming increasingly familiar around the region.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A year ago, this house would have sold within two weeks maximum, and they would have easily gotten close to $600,000,'' she said. ''This really shows you what's going on right now. It's like the market just collapsed.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collapsed may be a bit strong, but interviews with brokers throughout the metropolitan region indicate that the booming housing market of the last five years, when houses sold within days and bidding wars were routine, is, in a word, done.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statistics show that the inventory of available houses in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut has soared. Since buyers have more to look at, they are slower to make up their minds, and houses are staying on the market longer. Median sale prices across the region have continued to rise in most places, but not at the double-digit rates the market saw in recent years. Brokers say that after five years of through-the-roof price increases and almost frantic activity, the housing market is settling down to a new normal. While houses that are priced right can still set off bidding wars and sell in a matter of days, it is more common now for them to sit on the market for two to three months, with prices often coming down in the interim. Some houses in the $1 million range and higher have dropped in price by more than $200,000, while lower-priced homes have had smaller percentage decreases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, buyers and sellers have reached a wary stalemate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're at a point where sellers don't want to lower their prices and buyers don't want to raise their bids,'' said Roberta Plutzik Baldwin, a broker at Re/Max Village Square in Upper Montclair, N.J. ''Houses that are priced properly are selling, but buyers are now saying, 'Wait a second, the market is stabilizing, so why should I pay $20,000 more when I could pay less?' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Gallagher, a broker who owns eight Century 21 offices on Long Island, called it a buyer's market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've never seen as many open houses as I see now,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gallagher said that in light of the changing climate, real estate agents have been pushing harder in recent months to convince sellers that they cannot expect the kind of price increases they saw in recent years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Agents aren't telling people to get less than a house is worth; they're just getting the asking prices down to where they should be,'' he said. ''People are finally starting to understand that even if they could have gotten more for their house last year, it's not last year.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nassau County, the median home price at the end of June was $500,000, a 6.3 percent increase over the same month in 2005; the figure for Suffolk County was $410,500, a 6.6 percent increase, according to Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But comparable yearly price increases in the last five years ranged from 11.1 percent to 21.1 percent. ''This year's single-digit increases will probably translate into selective declines in home prices sometime next year,'' Dr. Kamer said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debi Orr, a real estate broker with Keller Williams Realty in Ridgefield, Conn., said home sellers there had been accustomed to looking at what houses in their neighborhoods had sold for in recent months and adding $100,000 to the asking price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the past you could add that cushion into the price and it would still sell, but you can't do that this year,'' she said. ''Now you have to pay attention to what the market indicates and not overshoot.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Serious sellers, she added, are willing to listen to that advice.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Boris, for example, who lives in Ridgefield with his wife, Christine, and their two children, said he initially thought he could have sold his three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot colonial farmhouse there this year for more than $700,000, based on what others in his neighborhood had sold for. But Ms. Orr persuaded him to set his sights lower and helped him put the house on the market for $679,000 in mid-May. ''Her counsel turned out to be very good,'' Mr. Boris said. The house sold in five days for $685,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE new home that Mr. Boris bought, on the other hand, had been overpriced, he said, and it stayed on the market for close to nine months. The four-bedroom, 5,100-square-foot Georgian colonial, on an acre of property, went on the market last summer for $1.6 million. By the time Mr. Boris looked at it, the asking price had dropped to $1.37 million, and he bought it for $1.25 million. ''It was exactly the scenario we were looking for on the purchase side,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Egan, editor in chief of publications for the Warren Group, which provides real estate data in New England, said that if current trends held in Connecticut, average home prices would probably drop a little by the end of the year. ''But to put it all in perspective, what we saw in the last five years was unsustainable,'' he said. ''What we're seeing now is probably necessary and overdue.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another clear sign that home sales are undergoing a market correction is the growth in inventories. In Nassau County, the inventory of homes for sale was up by 75 percent in June 2006 over the previous year, to 9,934 from 5,662. Inventory in Suffolk County went up by 65 percent to 13,724 homes in June, compared with 8,318 in 2005, Dr. Kamer said. ''Those are big increases, but they're really just returning to more normal inventory levels,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester County, where the median price of a single-family home was $715,000 at the end of June, a 2.1 percent increase from a year earlier, total inventory was up by 30 percent over the previous year, to 7,784 residential units, according to data from the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. Inventory had dropped as low as 3,000 units in 2001, but the current level is much more typical, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive of the Westchester Board of Realtors in White Plains. ''We're getting back to a normal market after an abnormal run-up of five years,'' he said. But because it has happened rather quickly, he said, ''it's still being felt because it was a sudden adjustment.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Gross, an investor from New York City who bought a three-bedroom house in New Rochelle in February 2005, hoping to resell it at a profit after making renovations, said he had had trouble getting the price he wanted. He bought the house for $315,000 and put in more than $100,000 in repairs and renovations, he said.Now, despite having had the house appraised at $555,000 and putting it on the market three months ago, he has yet to receive an offer that exceeds $500,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems like the boom kind of ended with everybody's talk of the bubble bursting,'' he said. ''I think all the talk actually made it happen.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several reasons for the increase in inventory, according to George Stone, senior vice president for Sotheby's International Realty in Westchester. Some sellers have put their homes on the market in the hopes of latching onto the housing boom before it ends definitively.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stone also pointed to aging baby boomers who are just now reaching retirement age and therefore considering whether to downsize. But since the demand for the smaller houses and condominiums most often sought by empty-nesters exceeds the current supply in the region, many of those sellers aren't highly motivated. ''A lot of those sellers are interested in moving, but they might not have a place to move to yet, so they won't sell unless they get their price,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased inventory naturally leads to homes staying on the market longer. ''People have so much more to look at, and they don't feel the pressure to make a decision in two seconds flat,'' said Louise Brooks, an agent with the Prudential Douglas Elliman office in Locust Valley, N.Y.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last five years until this year, most homes in Hudson and Bergen Counties were selling within a month, according to Phyllis Bixon, regional vice president for Weichert Realtors in northeastern New Jersey. Today, she said, there are some areas where houses stay on the market for 5 to 6 months, even as long as 10 months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are some buyers who feel they want to wait for the bottom, but you never know when the bottom's going to come,'' she said. ''And if I had to guess, I'd say we're not so far from the bottom right now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the New Jersey Multiple Listing Service, the inventory of single-family homes in Bergen, Hudson, Passaic and Essex Counties was up 49 percent in June, to 6,768, compared with 4,538 in June 2005. The median sales price was up 3 percent, to $470,000; each of the previous five years had seen double-digit increases, going to $455,000 in 2005 from $275,000 in 2000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc and Pamela Ross of Fair Lawn, N.J., looked at 25 houses in New Jersey last year, but never made an offer because prices were too high, they said. They resumed their house hunt a few weeks ago when they saw prices start to go down. Recently they were looking at a two-story colonial in Englewood that was listed at $424,900.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You realize now some of these houses now are in our reach,'' Mrs. Ross said, as they toured an open house in Englewood one recent Sunday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're liking the prices better, a lot better than before,'' Mr. Ross said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LYNN AND FRANK BALDUCCI'S house in Bethpage, N.Y., should be a real estate agent's dream: 4br, 2ba, large new EIK, formal LR, family room, new roof and siding, move-in condition.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Balduccis put their 1951 colonial on the market in early May. They held seven open houses, drawing 10 or so potential buyers, but they still had not gotten a single offer as of early August -- even after they dropped their asking price to $539,000 from $589,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very depressing,'' Ms. Balducci said, adding that at least seven houses in her neighborhood had been on the market for at least as long as theirs.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LYNN AND FRANK BALDUCCI'S house in Bethpage, N.Y., should be a real estate agent's dream: 4br, 2ba, large new EIK, formal LR, family room, new roof and siding, move-in condition.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Balduccis put their 1951 colonial on the market in early May. They held seven open houses, drawing 10 or so potential buyers, but they still had not gotten a single offer as of early August -- even after they dropped their asking price to $539,000 from $589,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very depressing,'' Ms. Balducci said, adding that at least seven houses in her neighborhood had been on the market for at least as long as theirs. ''It's a little scary for us, too, because we very shortly may be in a position where we have to carry two mortgages.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Balduccis, who have a 3 1/2-month-old girl, Emily, are moving to get more space as well as a waterfront location; they have bought a house on a canal off Seaford Creek in Massapequa and are scheduled to close on it in a few weeks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Balduccis' agent, Peggy Chugkowski, with Prudential Douglas Elliman in Massapequa, tells a story that is becoming increasingly familiar around the region.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A year ago, this house would have sold within two weeks maximum, and they would have easily gotten close to $600,000,'' she said. ''This really shows you what's going on right now. It's like the market just collapsed.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collapsed may be a bit strong, but interviews with brokers throughout the metropolitan region indicate that the booming housing market of the last five years, when houses sold within days and bidding wars were routine, is, in a word, done.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statistics show that the inventory of available houses in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut has soared. Since buyers have more to look at, they are slower to make up their minds, and houses are staying on the market longer. Median sale prices across the region have continued to rise in most places, but not at the double-digit rates the market saw in recent years. Brokers say that after five years of through-the-roof price increases and almost frantic activity, the housing market is settling down to a new normal. While houses that are priced right can still set off bidding wars and sell in a matter of days, it is more common now for them to sit on the market for two to three months, with prices often coming down in the interim. Some houses in the $1 million range and higher have dropped in price by more than $200,000, while lower-priced homes have had smaller percentage decreases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, buyers and sellers have reached a wary stalemate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're at a point where sellers don't want to lower their prices and buyers don't want to raise their bids,'' said Roberta Plutzik Baldwin, a broker at Re/Max Village Square in Upper Montclair, N.J. ''Houses that are priced properly are selling, but buyers are now saying, 'Wait a second, the market is stabilizing, so why should I pay $20,000 more when I could pay less?' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Gallagher, a broker who owns eight Century 21 offices on Long Island, called it a buyer's market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've never seen as many open houses as I see now,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gallagher said that in light of the changing climate, real estate agents have been pushing harder in recent months to convince sellers that they cannot expect the kind of price increases they saw in recent years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Agents aren't telling people to get less than a house is worth; they're just getting the asking prices down to where they should be,'' he said. ''People are finally starting to understand that even if they could have gotten more for their house last year, it's not last year.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nassau County, the median home price at the end of June was $500,000, a 6.3 percent increase over the same month in 2005; the figure for Suffolk County was $410,500, a 6.6 percent increase, according to Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But comparable yearly price increases in the last five years ranged from 11.1 percent to 21.1 percent. ''This year's single-digit increases will probably translate into selective declines in home prices sometime next year,'' Dr. Kamer said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debi Orr, a real estate broker with Keller Williams Realty in Ridgefield, Conn., said home sellers there had been accustomed to looking at what houses in their neighborhoods had sold for in recent months and adding $100,000 to the asking price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the past you could add that cushion into the price and it would still sell, but you can't do that this year,'' she said. ''Now you have to pay attention to what the market indicates and not overshoot.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Serious sellers, she added, are willing to listen to that advice.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Boris, for example, who lives in Ridgefield with his wife, Christine, and their two children, said he initially thought he could have sold his three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot colonial farmhouse there this year for more than $700,000, based on what others in his neighborhood had sold for. But Ms. Orr persuaded him to set his sights lower and helped him put the house on the market for $679,000 in mid-May. ''Her counsel turned out to be very good,'' Mr. Boris said. The house sold in five days for $685,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE new home that Mr. Boris bought, on the other hand, had been overpriced, he said, and it stayed on the market for close to nine months. The four-bedroom, 5,100-square-foot Georgian colonial, on an acre of property, went on the market last summer for $1.6 million. By the time Mr. Boris looked at it, the asking price had dropped to $1.37 million, and he bought it for $1.25 million. ''It was exactly the scenario we were looking for on the purchase side,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Egan, editor in chief of publications for the Warren Group, which provides real estate data in New England, said that if current trends held in Connecticut, average home prices would probably drop a little by the end of the year. ''But to put it all in perspective, what we saw in the last five years was unsustainable,'' he said. ''What we're seeing now is probably necessary and overdue.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another clear sign that home sales are undergoing a market correction is the growth in inventories. In Nassau County, the inventory of homes for sale was up by 75 percent in June 2006 over the previous year, to 9,934 from 5,662. Inventory in Suffolk County went up by 65 percent to 13,724 homes in June, compared with 8,318 in 2005, Dr. Kamer said. ''Those are big increases, but they're really just returning to more normal inventory levels,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester County, where the median price of a single-family home was $715,000 at the end of June, a 2.1 percent increase from a year earlier, total inventory was up by 30 percent over the previous year, to 7,784 residential units, according to data from the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. Inventory had dropped as low as 3,000 units in 2001, but the current level is much more typical, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive of the Westchester Board of Realtors in White Plains. ''We're getting back to a normal market after an abnormal run-up of five years,'' he said. But because it has happened rather quickly, he said, ''it's still being felt because it was a sudden adjustment.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Gross, an investor from New York City who bought a three-bedroom house in New Rochelle in February 2005, hoping to resell it at a profit after making renovations, said he had had trouble getting the price he wanted. He bought the house for $315,000 and put in more than $100,000 in repairs and renovations, he said. Now, despite having had the house appraised at $555,000 and putting it on the market three months ago, he has yet to receive an offer that exceeds $500,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems like the boom kind of ended with everybody's talk of the bubble bursting,'' he said. ''I think all the talk actually made it happen.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several reasons for the increase in inventory, according to George Stone, senior vice president for Sotheby's International Realty in Westchester. Some sellers have put their homes on the market in the hopes of latching onto the housing boom before it ends definitively.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stone also pointed to aging baby boomers who are just now reaching retirement age and therefore considering whether to downsize. But since the demand for the smaller houses and condominiums most often sought by empty-nesters exceeds the current supply in the region, many of those sellers aren't highly motivated. ''A lot of those sellers are interested in moving, but they might not have a place to move to yet, so they won't sell unless they get their price,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased inventory naturally leads to homes staying on the market longer. ''People have so much more to look at, and they don't feel the pressure to make a decision in two seconds flat,'' said Louise Brooks, an agent with the Prudential Douglas Elliman office in Locust Valley, N.Y.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last five years until this year, most homes in Hudson and Bergen Counties were selling within a month, according to Phyllis Bixon, regional vice president for Weichert Realtors in northeastern New Jersey. Today, she said, there are some areas where houses stay on the market for 5 to 6 months, even as long as 10 months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are some buyers who feel they want to wait for the bottom, but you never know when the bottom's going to come,'' she said. ''And if I had to guess, I'd say we're not so far from the bottom right now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the New Jersey Multiple Listing Service, the inventory of single-family homes in Bergen, Hudson, Passaic and Essex Counties was up 49 percent in June, to 6,768, compared with 4,538 in June 2005. The median sales price was up 3 percent, to $470,000; each of the previous five years had seen double-digit increases, going to $455,000 in 2005 from $275,000 in 2000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc and Pamela Ross of Fair Lawn, N.J., looked at 25 houses in New Jersey last year, but never made an offer because prices were too high, they said. They resumed their house hunt a few weeks ago when they saw prices start to go down. Recently they were looking at a two-story colonial in Englewood that was listed at $424,900.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You realize now some of these houses now are in our reach,'' Mrs. Ross said, as they toured an open house in Englewood one recent Sunday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're liking the prices better, a lot better than before,'' Mr. Ross said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debi Orr, a real estate broker with Keller Williams Realty in Ridgefield, Conn., said home sellers there had been accustomed to looking at what houses in their neighborhoods had sold for in recent months and adding $100,000 to the asking price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the past you could add that cushion into the price and it would still sell, but you can't do that this year,'' she said. ''Now you have to pay attention to what the market indicates and not overshoot.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Serious sellers, she added, are willing to listen to that advice.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Boris, for example, who lives in Ridgefield with his wife, Christine, and their two children, said he initially thought he could have sold his three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot colonial farmhouse there this year for more than $700,000, based on what others in his neighborhood had sold for. But Ms. Orr persuaded him to set his sights lower and helped him put the house on the market for $679,000 in mid-May. ''Her counsel turned out to be very good,'' Mr. Boris said. The house sold in five days for $685,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE new home that Mr. Boris bought, on the other hand, had been overpriced, he said, and it stayed on the market for close to nine months. The four-bedroom, 5,100-square-foot Georgian colonial, on an acre of property, went on the market last summer for $1.6 million. By the time Mr. Boris looked at it, the asking price had dropped to $1.37 million, and he bought it for $1.25 million. ''It was exactly the scenario we were looking for on the purchase side,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Egan, editor in chief of publications for the Warren Group, which provides real estate data in New England, said that if current trends held in Connecticut, average home prices would probably drop a little by the end of the year. ''But to put it all in perspective, what we saw in the last five years was unsustainable,'' he said. ''What we're seeing now is probably necessary and overdue.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another clear sign that home sales are undergoing a market correction is the growth in inventories. In Nassau County, the inventory of homes for sale was up by 75 percent in June 2006 over the previous year, to 9,934 from 5,662. Inventory in Suffolk County went up by 65 percent to 13,724 homes in June, compared with 8,318 in 2005, Dr. Kamer said. ''Those are big increases, but they're really just returning to more normal inventory levels,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester County, where the median price of a single-family home was $715,000 at the end of June, a 2.1 percent increase from a year earlier, total inventory was up by 30 percent over the previous year, to 7,784 residential units, according to data from the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. Inventory had dropped as low as 3,000 units in 2001, but the current level is much more typical, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive of the Westchester Board of Realtors in White Plains. ''We're getting back to a normal market after an abnormal run-up of five years,'' he said. But because it has happened rather quickly, he said, ''it's still being felt because it was a sudden adjustment.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Gross, an investor from New York City who bought a three-bedroom house in New Rochelle in February 2005, hoping to resell it at a profit after making renovations, said he had had trouble getting the price he wanted. He bought the house for $315,000 and put in more than $100,000 in repairs and renovations, he said. Now, despite having had the house appraised at $555,000 and putting it on the market three months ago, he has yet to receive an offer that exceeds $500,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems like the boom kind of ended with everybody's talk of the bubble bursting,'' he said. ''I think all the talk actually made it happen.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several reasons for the increase in inventory, according to George Stone, senior vice president for Sotheby's International Realty in Westchester. Some sellers have put their homes on the market in the hopes of latching onto the housing boom before it ends definitively.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stone also pointed to aging baby boomers who are just now reaching retirement age and therefore considering whether to downsize. But since the demand for the smaller houses and condominiums most often sought by empty-nesters exceeds the current supply in the region, many of those sellers aren't highly motivated. ''A lot of those sellers are interested in moving, but they might not have a place to move to yet, so they won't sell unless they get their price,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased inventory naturally leads to homes staying on the market longer. ''People have so much more to look at, and they don't feel the pressure to make a decision in two seconds flat,'' said Louise Brooks, an agent with the Prudential Douglas Elliman office in Locust Valley, N.Y.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last five years until this year, most homes in Hudson and Bergen Counties were selling within a month, according to Phyllis Bixon, regional vice president for Weichert Realtors in northeastern New Jersey. Today, she said, there are some areas where houses stay on the market for 5 to 6 months, even as long as 10 months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are some buyers who feel they want to wait for the bottom, but you never know when the bottom's going to come,'' she said. ''And if I had to guess, I'd say we're not so far from the bottom right now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the New Jersey Multiple Listing Service, the inventory of single-family homes in Bergen, Hudson, Passaic and Essex Counties was up 49 percent in June, to 6,768, compared with 4,538 in June 2005. The median sales price was up 3 percent, to $470,000; each of the previous five years had seen double-digit increases, going to $455,000 in 2005 from $275,000 in 2000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc and Pamela Ross of Fair Lawn, N.J., looked at 25 houses in New Jersey last year, but never made an offer because prices were too high, they said. They resumed their house hunt a few weeks ago when they saw prices start to go down. Recently they were looking at a two-story colonial in Englewood that was listed at $424,900.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You realize now some of these houses now are in our reach,'' Mrs. Ross said, as they toured an open house in Englewood one recent Sunday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're liking the prices better, a lot better than before,'' Mr. Ross said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confirming a slowdown in the county's housing market, a report by the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service showed that the sales of all homes fell in the second quarter compared with the same period last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of sales of all homes fell about 10 percent, to 2,403, from 2,673 in the second quarter of 2005  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardest hit were single-family homes, with sales down 15 percent, to 1,345 from 1,580 last year.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME sales in Fairfield County slumped dramatically in the first half of 2006, and prices barely budged, confirming a trend real estate brokers started noticing last year: the era of hot sales and double-digit-percentage price increases has faded.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through June 30, 3,599 homes sold, down 15 percent from 4,246 in the same period last year. Median prices increased 4 percent, to $549,000 in 2006, up from $528,000 in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers, from four Multiple Listing Service databases kept for various parts of the county, include all homes sold through agents, but do not include those sold by builders or directly by owners.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statewide, second-quarter numbers have not yet been compiled, said Mark Foreman, the president of the Connecticut Association of Realtors, but he expected similar results.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The general consensus is that's sales have definitely slowed down,'' he said in an interview on Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices, too, have not been rising at nearly the same levels as in the recent past, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's gone up, but it really hasn't changed that much,'' he said. ''In the past couple of years, you were seeing 15 to 20 percent.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Tetreau, an agent with William Raveis Real Estate in Fairfield, who is also the president of the Greater Fairfield Board of Realtors, said there were 90 percent more homes on the market in Fairfield at the beginning of June than there were at the same time a year earlier. Buyers, he said, are waiting longer to choose a home, hoping that prices go down. That is not an unreasonable assumption, he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's taking longer to sell a house, and at some point I would expect prices to fall,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tetreau said that social trends could also explain the downturn. Baby boomers from Connecticut have been moving to warmer climates or into smaller homes, he said, and their children have not yet begun buying bigger houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Foreman said the slowdown in home sales and flattening of prices was not evidence of the local real-estate bubble bursting. The market always goes through cycles, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's impossible to sustain a boom forever,'' he said. ''It had to either slow down or end. We had probably six or seven years of growth and price appreciation.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A chart with the In the Region article in Manhattan and Long Island copies last Sunday about real estate market trends misstated the most recent median prices for Nassau and Suffolk counties. The higher price for each county was recorded in June 2006; the lower was for June 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Aug 06 2006   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN what may be a ''rude awakening,'' as one real estate agent put it, the number of Long Island homes being put up for sale, combined with those sitting on the market, is climbing skyward, according to a report from the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simultaneously, the prices paid for homes are still increasing, but at a much slower rate than last year, and the number of closed sales has fallen in many Long Island areas compared with June of last year, the listing service reported.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At midyear, there were 75 percent more homes on the market in Nassau County and 65 percent more in Suffolk County than a year earlier. Although median sale prices were 6.6 percent higher in Suffolk County and 6.4 percent in Nassau, median contract prices, which are more current, fell in Nassau last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers report far fewer buyers in recent months. They also say sellers have not yet caught up with the trend by curbing their asking prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bethany Marten, a Baldwin-based broker who represents buyers on Long Island and in Queens, said that the number of buyers she has seen has dropped 50 percent. But home prices have not dropped from their highs. ''The affordability level is going out the window,'' she said. In addition, more homeowners with adjustable-rate or interest-only mortgages are trying to refinance their homes with fixed-rate mortgages as their payments begin to rise, said Ms. Marten, who is also a mortgage broker.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the ''option'' adjustable-rate mortgages that were popular with cash-poor buyers when home values were rising rapidly are no longer available, according to Robert Campbell, a professor of real estate financing at Hofstra University.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those loans had extremely low interest rates for a short period -- perhaps three years -- then bounced up to higher rates when the period expired. For homeowners who used that kind of financing in recent years, higher payments are coming due. ''Owners of the houses are seeing those options expire and the debt-service payments are headed up by a lot, by a huge amount in some cases,'' Professor Campbell said. ''That makes it more tempting to sell.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Georgianna Velardi, a broker at Century 21 Petrey Real Estate in Long Beach, said she had recently seen more sellers looking for a way out of high mortgage payments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple in their late 30's came in to price their three-bedroom ranch. The interest rate on their mortgage had risen to 9.5 percent, from 3.5 percent three years ago. They didn't have the equity or good credit to qualify for refinancing at a lower rate. To make matters worse, on July 1 the City of Long Beach raised property taxes 25 percent. ''They needed to get out because they were so overwhelmed,'' Ms. Velardi said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the area of Nassau that includes Bethpage and Farmingdale and northeastern parts of the Towns of Hempstead and Oyster Bay, the Multiple Listing service reported that 94.4 percent more homes on the market than there were in June of last year. The median price there increased only 3.1 percent, to $447,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kari Testa, a broker with ReMax Home Town in Bethpage, said that rising taxes and sudden increases in monthly payments from ''fancy mortgages'' were two reasons that the market was flooded with homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while monthly reports from the Multiple Listing Service in the spring seemed to leave no doubt that Long Island's market has stopped soaring, the numbers now show uneven performance in many areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the median price of properties that sold last month in the area that includes the Town of North Hempstead and the northern portion of the Town of Oyster Bay was up 10.8 percent, to $695,000, compared with June 2005. But in May, the median price for the same area declined 4.3 percent from May 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Armstrong, president of the Multiple Listing Service and the owner of Century 21 Princeton Properties in Suffolk, said closing prices in June reflected market conditions up to three months earlier, when the deals were made.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you look at closing prices, you're looking at the history,'' Mr. Armstrong said. ''If you look at contract prices, it gives you a more general barometer of the market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If so, those numbers indicate more intense pressure on prices. Median contract prices for June dropped 1.6 percent, to $485,000, in Nassau and rose 2 percent, to $408,000, in Suffolk compared with June of last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More affordable areas, mostly in Suffolk County, saw greater increases in median prices. In the area that includes the Town of Brookhaven south of the Long Island Expressway and most of the eastern portion of the Town of Islip, the median sale price rose 11 percent. But there were 53 percent more homes on the market and 10 percent fewer sales there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All four towns on the East End of Long Island showed significant declines in homes sold and uneven changes in median prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for the first six months of 2006 in Riverhead, a town that is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on downtown revitalization efforts and new development, was $418,700, which is 24.2 percent higher than a year earlier, according to data from Suffolk Research Service Inc., a firm that tracks East End real estate transactions. But Riverhead also experienced the sharpest drop in home sales, 28.2 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other three East End towns, where second homes make up a big chunk of the market, hardly fared better: sales were down 19 percent in Southold, 18.9 percent in East Hampton and 14.3 percent in Southampton.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have been more conservative in recent months and are taking their time, according to Htun Han, a partner in the Hamptons Realty Group in East Hampton.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They feel they can pick and choose what they want,'' Mr. Han said, ''erroneously thinking that owners are getting desperate and will take whatever they offer.'' This has led to rising inventory, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For someone who is really ready to buy, now is the best time,'' he added. ''Inventory is high and prices have stabilized somewhat.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But back in the primary-home markets of western Suffolk and Nassau, Ms. Marten, the buyer's broker, said she expected to see even more homes sitting on the market longer, and more foreclosures. ''It's not going to bottom out immediately,'' Ms. Marten said. ''We're going to see, I believe, what we saw in 1988: a flattening, a gradual downturn and then down and down until it hits bottom.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, Professor Campbell of Hofstra said he did not expect to see double-digit decreases in percent change of median prices over a string of quarters, or huge numbers of defaults and foreclosures. Instead, there will be ''a soft market and a gentle decline in prices over the next year at least, possibly much longer than that.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN the American economy fell into recession five years ago, it was the strength of the housing market that kept the downturn short and mild. Home sales kept rising throughout the downturn, and then took off when the recession began.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now home sales are falling and the number of unsold homes is at the highest level ever. Housing starts are starting to fall, but remain at a high level by historical standards. If sales do not pick up this summer, when sales are usually seasonally strong, it could be a sign that prices are going to come under pressure and lead to a much larger decline in housing starts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accompanying charts show year-over-year changes in sales of existing single-family homes and apartments, using six-month moving averages to smooth out monthly fluctuations. The latest figures show sales of single-family homes down 4.4 percent, the largest dip since 1995, and apartment sales off 6.6 percent. Statistics on apartment sales are only available back to 1999, but that is the worst showing in that period.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the number of existing single-family homes on the market is up 33 percent year-over-year, measured the same way. Figures from the National Association of Realtors, going back to 1983, show no comparable increase in homes for sale. The number of condominiums and cooperative apartments for sale is up 61 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture is consistent with demand for homes suddenly drying up, while sellers are reluctant to cut prices. Such a standoff could end with buyers returning, but it could also end with prices starting to slip, or with a lot of homes being pulled off the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes make up a much smaller part of the market, and are not shown in the charts. But those figures show even more rapid increases in inventory and larger declines in sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales outlook appears to be falling most rapidly in the Western states, where sales of existing single-family homes are running at 13 percent below levels a year ago. A couple of years ago, the West was showing the most rapid gains in sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors do not break down inventory by region, so it is not clear from their data where the unsold homes and apartments are located. But sales of existing apartments are weakest in the South and West, which could be an indication of growing inventories in the largest states in the two regions, Florida and California.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, over the 12 months through June more than 6 million single-family existing homes and 1.2 million new homes were sold. Only a few years ago, both of those figures would have been records, and the declines are coming from high levels. It is conceivable that the market will stabilize at levels that look weak only when compared to last year's extraordinary numbers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with sales weakening and the number of available homes rising, those who warned of a housing bubble must be wondering if their fears are finally becoming reality.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selling a new home is getting harder and harder: just ask the builders who are being forced these days to entice potential buyers with expensive inducements like free swimming pools and fancy kitchen cabinets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the torrid pace in the existing-home market is slackening, as prices are leveling off and properties are staying on the market a lot longer than they used to.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding it all together, a variety of experts now say, the housing industry appears to be moving from a boom to something that is starting to look a lot like a bust.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing has had a great five-year run,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief investment strategist for Oak Associates, a money management firm in Akron, Ohio, and a longtime bull on the economy. While he still does not expect a housing downturn to damage the overall economy severely, he predicts that the housing industry itself is entering a longer decline.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Instead of being a seller's market,'' he said, ''it became a buyer's market. And once the psychology changes, it could take a while to reverse. Buyers recognize there's no need to rush out to buy a home.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest housing data, released yesterday by the National Association of Realtors, made clear that a significant slowdown is under way. It showed that the sales pace for existing homes fell for a third straight month in June -- the ninth monthly decline since hitting a record last June.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a seasonally adjusted annual basis, the rate of existing-home sales dropped to 6.6 million, down from 6.7 million in May and well below the record 7.3 million pace reported last June. The number of existing homes still on the market, meanwhile, grew to a record of 3.725 million units, representing a 6.8-month supply at the June selling pace, up from 6.4 months in May.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift of the upper hand from seller to buyer is showing up in home prices. Last month, the national median price rose to $231,000, less than 1 percent higher than in June 2005. That was the smallest year-over-year increase in more than 11 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are losing their grasp on the new-home market, which is why so many of them have responded by being more aggressive in their use of promotions to sell homes. A check by the National Association of Home Builders of 369 builders across the country found that 75 percent are currently including add-ons like pools or garages at no additional cost when they sell a home. That compares with 50 percent a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of builders reported offering free vacations. None did last July.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are also helping buyers finance their homes. The survey found that 33 percent of builders are currently absorbing financing points on mortgages, which allows homeowners to pay lower monthly rates. Only 18 percent reported doing so a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When people were lining up to buy, ''the only thing they had to complain about last year was getting enough material, labor and land,'' said Michael Carliner, an economist with the home builders association. But now, he added, ''things are slowing down.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home builders association reported last week that builder confidence had fallen to its lowest level in 14 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Wainwright, a realtor with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Mesa, Ariz., says that each time he walks into the sales office of a new housing development, the incentives seem to change.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It varies from week to week,'' he said. ''Sometimes it'll be a pool or $25,000 or even more than $50,000.'' He said he has seen cars, kitchen cabinets and flooring thrown in free. Regionally, the slowdown in sales of existing homes last month was most pronounced in the South. The Northeast also fell, while sales in the Midwest and the West held steady compared with May.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One consequence of the slowing housing market, economists and real estate experts said, is a strengthening of the rental property market. With interest rates rising, buying a home is becoming less affordable to more and more Americans. That gives landlords improved pricing power that home sellers now lack.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of the people that wanted to make a jump to their own home are waiting,'' Mark Obrinsky, chief economist for the National Multi Housing Council, a trade group for the apartment rental business. ''This year is going to be a much better year than we've seen for quite a few years.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing council is predicting the biggest net increase in apartment rentals this year since 2000, Mr. Obrinsky said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a growing number of potential buyers moving into rental units or holding onto the homes they own, builders across the country are canceling or delaying housing developments. From Las Vegas to Dallas to Washington, some developers now report abandoning condo projects because sales are not meeting expectations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, D. R. Horton, the nation's largest home builder, said it would build fewer homes this year than it initially predicted. It also sharply cut its earnings guidance for the year by 30 percent, citing growing inventories of unsold homes and the increased use of incentives as part of the reason.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Kenneth Simonson, chief economist with the Associated General Contractors of America, said he thought more projects would be canceled as demand falls.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Certainly more projects will be scrubbed,'' he said. ''The risk is too great that they're going to wind up paying more for the project and collecting less.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yardeni of Oak Associates added: ''Home builders will tell you it feels like a recession.''   </p>
