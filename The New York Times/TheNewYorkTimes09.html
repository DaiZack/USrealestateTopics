<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR whatever reason, homes sales picked up in New Jersey in the latter part of 2011. A new statewide market report shows contract signings increased in six of the seven months from May through November, compared with 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the inventory of homes for sale shrank every month since May, according to Jeffrey G. Otteau, an analyst, whose Otteau Valuation Group in East Brunswick does monthly reports for the real estate industry; he called the latest news a concrete sign that the market was ''stabilizing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His December report was the first one in several years to sound a hopeful note. Until the state's huge foreclosure backlog comes back on the market -- and how fast that happens is important -- the market may improve sometime this year to the point that prices stop declining and perhaps even modestly start to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is the statewide picture. A great division in market fortunes between northern and southern Jersey -- and urbanized areas close to Manhattan and more rural regions -- became clear during the recent recession and remains stark in the fresh statistics. Mr. Otteau predicted that the gap would shape the timing and pattern of potential recovery, and several agents in the field agreed with him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Simply put,'' said Dawn Rapa, a Coldwell Banker Elite agent working in rural Salem County, ''the only people I've seen selling their houses recently are those who absolutely had to -- because they were in financial disarray, a job change, divorce or death.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salem County, rich in historic houses and farmland but short on well-paying jobs or a quick commute to an urban center, has the largest inventory of all 21 counties surveyed: 44.5 months' worth of houses, the preponderance of them priced under $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That compares with a statewide inventory of 13 months, both over all and in the under-$400,000 category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several other counties in southern New Jersey have inventories about twice the size of the state average -- 29 months' worth in Cumberland County, 26 in Cape May County, and 24 in Atlantic County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cape May and Atlantic, the primary backlog is for more expensive homes, many of them built in the boom years to appeal to shoreline vacationers. Atlantic has just shy of six years' worth of inventory in the $600,000-to-$1 million range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For homes priced from $1 million to $2.5 million, the Otteau report predicted, it will take more than four years to sell the inventory in Atlantic County and close to seven years in Ocean County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cumberland County, which like Salem is part of the Delaware Valley area that extends eastward from Pennsylvania, the homes are mostly priced under $400,000. There are not enough homes priced higher to be statistically significant, according to the report. Ms. Rapa said she sold 37 houses in Salem County last year, but prices were down ''considerably.'' And multiple listing numbers indicate that although inventory dipped 10 percent, there were 14 percent fewer sales over all compared with the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the Coldwell Banker agent's listings that have sat on the market for many months despite price drops: a restored and modernized 1851 colonial in the historic hamlet of Alloway with three bedrooms and two baths, now offered at $186,000; and a four-bedroom two-bath house on a horse farm with a barn and 10 acres in Pilesgrove, now listed for $349,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We just had an offer for $312,000 on the Pilesgrove house,'' first listed in February 2011, said Ms. Rapa, ''but the owners won't go there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market misery is not all concentrated in the south, however. In the northernmost county, Sussex, the inventory is 20 months. In the $400,000-to-$599,999 bracket, five and a half years' supply is already on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the town of Vernon, which is home to several popular ski areas, and where construction was booming in the mid-2000s, the average sale price of a home was $250,000 in 2007, according to the real estate Web site Trulia. Now the site has it at $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large house set on 1.3 acres there, with a view of ski slopes from the deck, was built and sold in 2004 for $392,000. The house, with three bedrooms and three and a half baths on Cherokee Trail, has been on the market since October, and the asking price is now $358,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby in the somewhat more affluent town of Sparta, a number of large houses built about a decade ago on one-acre or larger lots are now being offered at reduced prices or as short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Houses are selling,'' said Catherine Kut, an agent at <span class="companylink">Weichert Realtors</span> in Sparta, ''but they have to be in fabulous condition and still occupied, as a rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had a closing yesterday,'' she said earlier this month. ''The house was $438,000, and it sold in less than 90 days, but it was a cream puff. It had almost five acres of land, a finished walkout basement, brand-new granite counters -- everything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another of her listings was in great shape when it went on the market for $525,000 last February after the owner lost his job. A four-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath house, it is set on 1.3 acres and has a pool, and it was attractively decorated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the seller had to relocate for new employment. Now the vacant house is on the market as a short sale, in which a lender agrees to accept less than the amount owed on the mortgage, and listed at $445,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An ice dam formed on the roof earlier this winter and caused exterior damage, so a credit is being offered on the sale price to cover the cost of repairs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic expansion improved last month across most of the country while hiring was limited and housing remained stagnant, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> said on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy ''expanded at a modest to moderate pace'' from late November through the end of December on increased holiday retail sales, demand for services and oil-and-gas extraction, the Fed said in its beige book business survey. At the same time, most industries saw ''limited permanent hiring,'' and the housing market remained ''sluggish.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report may reinforce the views of a majority of Fed officials, who see an economy that is expanding without being strong enough to reduce joblessness as quickly as they would prefer. The unemployment rate dropped to 8.5 percent in December from 9.4 percent a year earlier. Fed officials are urging lawmakers to try more housing-aid programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reports on balance suggest ongoing improvement in economic conditions in recent months,'' the Fed said in the report, which comes out two weeks before each meeting on monetary policy. ''The combination of limited permanent hiring in most sectors and numerous active job seekers has continued to keep a lid on general wage increases.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The beige book report reflects a ''slightly better tone, slightly better data,'' said Joseph LaVorgna, chief United States economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. Even so, ''the financial market has taken recent Fed commentary as generally dovish and as a signal that the Fed is perhaps exploring more easing measures.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last beige book, released Nov. 30, said the economy expanded at a ''slow to moderate'' pace in 11 of 12 districts, led by gains in manufacturing and consumer spending. St. Louis was the only region to report a decline in economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Open Market Committee will meet Jan. 24-25 in Washington as officials debate whether to try new actions to lower borrowing costs. Fed policy makers will for the first time publish projections for the benchmark federal funds rate and will also update their forecasts for economic growth, unemployment and inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The beige book said that ''upward wage pressures were modest over all'' for workers across the country. The Labor Department said Jan. 6 that 200,000 jobs were added to payrolls in December, the most since September. The jobless rate declined for a fourth consecutive month to the lowest since February 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the New York Fed president, William C. Dudley, said last week that the ''outlook for unemployment is unacceptably high'' and that it was appropriate for the Fed to consider steps to ease monetary policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residential real estate market ''largely held steady at very low levels'' except for increasing construction of multifamily homes, the beige book said. The rental market tightened in some areas, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed said in the report that inflation and pressures to raise prices were limited at the end of last year. Several district banks reported that ''upward price pressures from rising commodity and input prices have eased substantially,'' the Fed said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lending edged up on higher demand from businesses, with the New York and Cleveland regions reporting increased loans in commercial mortgages, the Fed said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer lending ''was largely flat compared with the prior reporting period,'' the central bank said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate Fed report Jan. 9 showed that consumer borrowing in the United States rose in November by the most in 10 years. Credit increased by $20.4 billion, the biggest jump since November 2001, to $2.48 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most regions said that holiday retail sales ''were up noticeably over last year's season,'' and that consumer spending and confidence had improved, the Fed said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial and industrial loans from banks have increased to $1.34 trillion as of Dec. 28, the highest since October 2009, from $1.21 trillion a year earlier. They peaked at $1.62 trillion in October 2008.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest housing report indicates that further declines are in store for the weak American market, or at best a period of long, slow recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the United States fell by more than 1 percent in October, a survey showed on Tuesday, but the low prices have attracted investors to some of the cities where they have declined the most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index, a closely watched measure of home prices, was down 1.2 percent from September, according to nonseasonally adjusted data tracking 20 cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nineteen of the cities experienced price declines, with prices reaching new lows in Atlanta since its 2007 peak and in Las Vegas, from its 2006 peak, S.&amp; P. said. Only Phoenix posted a gain, with a 0.3 percent rise, the Case-Shiller data showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Atlanta and the Midwest are regions that really stand out in terms of recent relative weakness,'' said David M. Blitzer, the chairman of the index committee at S.&amp; P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report, however, pointed to some recovery and helped ease the sting of the report on home prices. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 64.5 in December from 55.2 in November, reaching its highest level since April. Analysts had forecast a level of 58.9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Consumer optimism is on the rise as job prospects improve, and the summer doldrums seem to be behind most Americans,'' said Chris G. Christopher Jr., the United States economist with IHS Global Insight. ''In November, the unemployment rate fell to 8.6 percent, and gasoline prices are falling, offering some relief to consumer mood and spending.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But neither the discouraging home-price data nor the sharp gain in confidence appeared to have much impact on the stock market in the United States, which is winding down the year with light trading. The indexes hovered between gains and losses most of the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones industrial average was down about 0.02 percent, or 2.65 points, to 12,291.35. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index rose less than a point to 1,265.43, while the Nasdaq was up 0.3 percent at 2,625.20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the S.&amp; P. and the Dow are on track to finish 2011 in positive territory, despite the lackluster investor sentiment and volatility that uneven domestic economic data and concerns over the euro zone sovereign debt crisis stirred up in the past year. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 6/32 to 100. The yield fell to 2 percent, from 2.02 percent on Friday. Markets were closed on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector has been destabilized since the financial crisis of 2008, hit by foreclosures, a glut of supply, weak demand, and a struggling job market -- all of which is making for a lackluster recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Newport, an analyst with IHS Global Insight, forecast that those factors could force down prices another 5 percent to 10 percent next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our forecast is they will hit bottom in the second half of 2012,'' said Mr. Newport. ''We still will have a lot of foreclosures. That is still going to stay high for another several years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller report on housing prices for October was worse than expected, exceeding analysts' forecasts for a 0.4 percent drop for that month, compared with the seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent monthly decline in the 20-city index. The index was down 3.4 percent from a year earlier, with Atlanta recording the worst annualized rate, dropping by 11.7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, housing statistics from other sources since the October survey showed relatively healthy activity, Mr. Blitzer wrote in the S.&amp; P. report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think going forward we are going to be bumping along the bottom,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''I do not see this as getting ready for a big plunge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said last week that sales of single-family houses, town houses, condos and co-ops in November rose to 4.42 million, their highest level in 10 months, according to its latest revised data. But there were also signs that buyers were still nervous and lenders were being cautious about approving loans -- the association said that a third of all contracts signed in November did not lead to closed sales. Data on starts for single-family housing also rose, Mr. Blitzer also noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robin Lemon, a realtor with the AtlantaPros Team, said parts of Atlanta have been particularly hard-hit by the recession, affecting companies and in turn, nearby housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously there are some pockets that are not seeing a decrease in home values,'' said Ms. Lemon, who was in between showing condos to a client. ''The hard hit ones are those areas where the businesses have suffered. South Atlanta has been hit really, really hard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and other experts in the business said that the low prices were attracting investors who were taking advantage of low rates on mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are definitely those folks who are taking advantage of the market and buyers are definitely out there, but they do not want to pay full price and they expect a 10 percent price reduction if it is a foreclosure,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nevada, investors were snapping up single-family homes and restoring them, said Paul Bell, the president of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors. The association said on its Web site that the median price of single-family homes sold in November was $125,000, up 3.3 percent from $121,000 in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are going through a lot of current inventory that is not in very good condition,'' Mr. Bell said in a telephone interview. ''We are seeing a big increase in that type of activity, and they are paying cash and going in and doing a first-class job in getting these single-family homes restored. Investors can lease those homes pretty quickly and get a cash flow until the market is ready for them.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) -- A surge in apartment construction gave home builders more work in November. And permits, a gauge of future construction, rose largely because of a jump in apartment permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in permits provides hope for the housing market, though 2011 is still shaping up as one of the worst years in history for home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders broke ground on a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 homes last month, a 9.3 percent jump from October, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. It was the highest level since April 2010. Still, the rate is far below the 1.2 million homes that economists say would be built each year in a healthy housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes rose 2.3 percent in November, while apartment construction jumped 32 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the home building industry is improving, albeit modestly, after two of the worst years in history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While beginning to improve, a strong, sustained recovery in the housing market, especially the important single-family sector, is still a ways off,'' said Steven Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, builders began work on roughly 587,000 homes, the worst year on record. This year, construction may top 600,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though new homes represent just 20 percent of the overall home market, they have an outsize impact on the economy. Each home built creates an average of three jobs for a year and generates about $90,000 in taxes, according to the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting has become a preferred option for many Americans who lost their jobs during the recession and were forced to leave their houses. The surge in apartments has provided a lift to the housing market but has not been enough to completely offset the loss of single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits rose 5.7 percent last month, helped by a 16 percent jump in permits for apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last year, permits for apartment buildings with five or more units have surged more than 80 percent. Permits for single-family homes, which account for about 70 percent of all home building, have increased just 3.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for new homes is weak. Record-low mortgage rates and plunging home prices have done little to help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief problem is that builders are struggling to compete with deeply discounted foreclosures and short sales. Short sales occur when lenders allow homes to be sold for less than what is owed on the mortgage. Few homes are selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After previous recessions, housing accounted for at least 15 percent of United States economic growth. Since the recession officially ended in June 2009, it has contributed just 4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, sales of new homes rose slightly, largely because builders cut their prices in the face of weak demand. Sales hit a six-month low in August. And this year is shaping up to be the worst since the government began keeping records a half-century ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason sales have fallen is that previously occupied homes have become a better deal than new homes. The median price of a new home is about 30 percent higher than the median price for a resale. That is nearly twice the markup typical in a healthy housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home builders' trade group said this week that its survey of industry sentiment rose in December to 21, the highest level since May 2010. Still, any reading below 50 indicates negative sentiment about the housing market. The index has not reached 50 since April 2006, the peak of the housing boom.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pierre Buljan guided his black Mercedes S.U.V. around the winding roads of the Hillsborough hills and into Atherton, where the mansions of Silicon Valley technology barons hide behind thick stone walls, wrought-iron gates and tall, manicured hedges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These people have essentially infinite money,'' said Mr. Buljan, who has been a Realtor on the Peninsula for more than 30 years. He pointed at a sloping four-acre property that included a large redwood grove with a private creek.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If someone falls in love with a property like this,'' he said, ''the price doesn't matter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everywhere Mr. Buljan turned, a historic transition was under way. A generation ago, many of these properties were second homes for San Francisco's elite families. These days, most are being bought, for cash, by international tycoons or the youthful leaders of local technology companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the wider Bay Area has suffered, along with the rest of the country, with falling property values and rising foreclosures, the luxury housing market has remained robust, analysts said. That is especially true in Silicon Valley, where an arms race for talent among emerging social networking companies has raised salaries for executives and engineers, and a resurgent market for initial public stock offerings is creating hundreds of new millionaires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the sales are eye-popping. In March, the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, an investor in <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Groupon</span> and <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>, bought a French-style chateau in Los Altos Hills for a reported $100 million. Some buyers have hidden their identities behind companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, an Atherton estate formerly owned by the great-grandniece of <span class="companylink">Levi Strauss</span> sold for $53 million, while the home of Sue Burns, a major investor in the San Francisco Giants, was sold for $20 million by her estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to take a while for the wider economy to recover, but there are enough people to make a difference at the high end of the housing market,'' keeping demand high, said Steve Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, a think tank in Palo Alto, where the median single-family home price last week was $1,838,750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the Peninsula, a small-scale building boom is under way as developers and wealthy property owners buy million-dollar homes, tear them down and build larger ones. Stroll down Waverley Street in Old Palo Alto, home to many <span class="companylink">Google</span> executives and the late Steve Jobs, and you'll see the ultramodern 6,000-square-foot house that <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s co-founder Larry Page is building, rising from its foundation. Mr. Page's mansion will also include a 3,500-square-foot basement that has been called a ''bat cave'' by neighbors. Analysts and builders said such high-end construction had been largely recession-proof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While the large number of foreclosures have created a significant inventory of homes at the middle and lower end and kept prices down, that hasn't happened at the top end,'' said Eduardo Martinez, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high unemployment rate in the Bay Area's construction sector has driven down wages and therefore the overall cost of building, said Leonard Mezhvinsky, a principal at Sieger Property Development. Meanwhile, the number of potential buyers for top-tier homes continues to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are expecting <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and <span class="companylink">Zynga</span> to go public,'' Mr. Mezhvinsky said recently, ''and that will create an instant number of multimillionaires.'' Indeed, <span class="companylink">Zynga</span> went public on Friday with a $1 billion stock offering. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> is widely expected to file a $10 billion offering early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In anticipation of the onslaught of new multimillionaires, Mr. Mezhvinsky bought a single-family home on Ralston Avenue in Hillsborough in 2009 and demolished it. ''When we're done, there will be a 10,000-square-foot main house, and a loge,'' he said. ''There will be a six-bedroom house, seven full bathrooms and two powder rooms. There is a swimming pool with a Jacuzzi. There is a sauna and steam room,'' and five fireplaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new house will not be finished until July or August, Mr. Mezhvinsky said, but it is already on the market for $13 million, nearly four times what he paid for it. The buyer will probably pay extra to finish it to his or her taste, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you're witnessing,'' said Mr. Buljan, the real estate agent, ''is the next generation of superwealth.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">In Riverdale, More 'For Sale' Signs Than Sales</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home required no gentle embellishment, no agent-speak tucked into the description beside the property listing. The five bedrooms and marble center hall were supposed to speak for themselves. The sprawling patio and yard space would look quite at home in one of the wealthy suburban hamlets a few miles to the north.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after shopping his client's home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx for nine months -- during which the initial asking price of $1.65 million had already fallen by more than $250,000 -- Sean Trebach said those two dreaded words about the owner last week: ''He's negotiable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past few years, a curious thing has happened in some of New York City's most desired acreage: Listings have skyrocketed, while sales have dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Streeteasy.com, a Web site that specializes in real estate in the city, it would take two years for buyers to absorb all the current listings in Riverdale, more than twice the time the process would have taken two years ago. In Manhattan, by contrast, the current market could be cleared in a little more than nine months, a quicker pace than one year earlier -- and one year before that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Available properties have increased by 80 percent in Riverdale over the last two years, as Manhattan listings have remained stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were some very optimistic developers who were trying to bring Manhattan-style buildings to Riverdale,'' said Sofia Song, vice president for research at Streeteasy. ''The new developments weren't cheap. When the bubble burst, the product started lingering.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction of new condominium complexes at least partly explains the increase in Riverdale availability, real estate agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony DeVivio, director of sales for Halstead Property in Upper Manhattan and Riverdale, blamed a glut of one-bedroom apartments; according to Streeteasy, the median price of Riverdale listings has fallen by about 13 percent over the last two years, to $299,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it does not fully capture the distress in Riverdale. ''For sale'' signs dot the lawns and mailboxes of sumptuous minimansions. Advertisements for open houses are pasted onto the streetlight posts that lead to leafy cul-de-sacs. In the window of a Halstead Property office on Johnson Avenue, photographs of available homes were sprinkled with euphemistic captions: ''price reduction,'' ''great bargain,'' ''priced to sell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a reputation as Manhattan's sleepy neighbor to the north, replete with trees and private schools, luxury sedans and well-groomed hedges, Riverdale had long sustained its value even as trendier options, like SoHo or TriBeCa, came into vogue. (Longtime Riverdalians might note that the neighborhood was once a celebrity haven in its own right, claiming Ed Sullivan, Lou Gehrig and many members of the Kennedy family as residents.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles Moerdler, chairman of the land use committee for Community Board 8 in the Bronx, said Riverdale was in the grips of a ''massive reconfiguration'' touching all segments of the market. He pointed to the luxury homes at Villanova Heights -- offered initially for $6.5 million to $9 million, according to the developer, John E. Fitzgerald, beginning more than two years ago. ''The market collapsed, and we couldn't sell anything,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homes have been introduced as rentals -- there are currently no vacancies, he added -- but Mr. Fitzgerald said he hoped to sell the houses, designed by Robert A. M. Stern, if and when the market dictates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There'll be another real estate bubble somewhere down the line,'' he said. ''There always is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moerdler said he was unsure when conditions might significantly improve, especially in what he called the ''middle of the market'' -- single-family homes like the one on Arlington Avenue that Mr. Trebach has struggled to move since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a market,'' Mr. Trebach said hopefully, leaning against the banister as he recalled those who had looked seriously at the house. ''A few people came close.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louis Grumet, 67, put his house in the Fieldston area of Riverdale on the market in May 2010, reasoning that an apartment in Manhattan would better serve his needs as a new wheelchair user. He and his wife finally completed a sale in June of this year -- well below their initial listing of around $1 million. ''We dropped it right away,'' said Mr. Grumet, who sold it for $815,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For real estate agents, the push to recast Riverdale's market as an opportunity has already begun. Mr. DeVivio, who said Halstead's Riverdale listings had remained relatively flat in recent years, encouraged buyers to ''pick off'' a 750-square-foot one bedroom for around $150,000 while they still could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they're priced right, they're selling,'' he said. ''Great deals, by the way.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Royal Bank of Scotland</span> announced Friday the sale of its British pub chain to the Dutch brewing giant Heineken for $:412 million ($646 million). The deal is part of an aggressive sale of noncore assets by the struggling British bank, which is 83 percent owned by the government after receiving a $:20 billion bailout in 2008. The bank bought the chain of 918 pubs, known as the Galaxy Pub Estate, in 1999 and 2000, as it looked to expand its operations into property to take advantage of rising prices of British commercial real estate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's housing, stupid. More precisely, it's housing finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Obama administration seeks ways to revive the economy, not to mention win an election, it is becoming clear that the biggest mistake officials made when they took office nearly three years ago was to underestimate the continuing damage to the economy from the mortgage crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is widespread agreement among economists that housing debt is at the heart of the slow recovery,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, the Harvard economist, ''and that finding a way to bring it down faster would accelerate the recovery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration has sought to encourage mortgage modifications by making it easier for homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth to nonetheless refinance their mortgages. But the success of that effort seems to have been limited, and calls are growing for more action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interestingly, it is Federal Reserve officials, who normally seek to avoid commenting on specific government policies outside the range of monetary policies, who have been sounding the alarm with increasing regularity. They have made clear that they fear monetary policy will not be enough to get the economy moving, and that they need help from Congress and the White House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We at the Federal Reserve are moving vigorously to promote a stronger economic recovery,'' said Janet Yellin, the Fed's vice chairman, in a speech in San Francisco this week. ''However, monetary policy is not a panacea, and it is essential for other policy makers to also do their part. In particular, there is a strong case for additional measures to address the dysfunctional housing market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, laid out a housing agenda when he spoke at West Point last month. He said action was needed to make it easier for more people to qualify for mortgage loans, and also broached an idea for something that so far has gotten little political support but probably will be necessary: reducing the amount that many borrowers owe while letting them keep their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He suggested that borrowers who were under water on their loans -- that is, they owe more than their houses were worth -- but were still making their payments should be able ''to earn accelerated principal reduction over time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any such plan risks infuriating homeowners who were responsible and did not borrow more than they could afford to pay. One way to improve the perceived fairness of a plan to allow principal reductions would be to tie such reductions to a structure that would give the lenders a share in any recovery in property values when the homes were eventually sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To many Republicans, the answer is simply to let the markets sort it out. That prescription seems to be based more on ideology than on any actual analysis of how the housing market is functioning, and it seems to infuriate Fed officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Regardless of how we got here, we, as a nation, currently have a housing market that is so severely out of balance that it is hampering our economic recovery,'' said Elizabeth A. Duke, a Fed governor, in a speech in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dudley, the New York Fed president, also denounced the way the market was functioning. ''In contrast to the efficient mechanisms in place in the commercial property market to work out troubled debt,'' he said in his speech at West Point, ''the infrastructure of the residential mortgage market is wholly inadequate to deal with a systemic shock to the housing market. Left alone, this flawed structure will destroy much more value in housing than is necessary.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First impressions can be misleading, and nowhere is that more true than in understanding the housing mess. The first symptoms of trouble came in the subprime market, and it was the problems of that market that were first put under a microscope. We found loans that had been made to unqualified borrowers on terms that were, in some cases, outrageous. We found fraud. We found that credit had become far too easy to get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we found private-label mortgage securitizations that were stuffed with horrid loans that never should have been made, rubber-stamped by rating agencies, guaranteed by insurance companies and purchased by institutional investors without anyone in the chain doing any real due diligence. We found securitizations that were managed so haphazardly that papers proving who owns mortgages had disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that was true, but focusing on such outrages can obscure what needs to be done. By now we should understand that the problems went far beyond the subprime market. There are many prime loans, made to responsible borrowers with good credit, that are in deep trouble. Property values did not collapse only in the neighborhoods where dubious loans were being made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of those troubled prime loans now are owned by the United States government -- or, to be more specific, by its wards, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That is highly regrettable in some ways, but it gave the Obama administration an opportunity to take steps to change things without Congressional action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It did that this fall when it changed the rules for the mortgage modification program, starting Thursday, to allow homeowners who were under water on their mortgage obligations to nonetheless refinance their loans -- and thus get the benefit of the lower interest rates that the Fed's monetary policy has produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That makes sense because Fannie and Freddie already have the credit risk on the underwater loans. Allowing the borrower to refinance -- and thus owe lower monthly payments -- reduces the risk of the loan, at least by a little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie and Freddie financed many of the loans by selling mortgage-backed securities to investors who collect the interest until the loans are repaid, and then get the principal back. If there were large numbers of refinancings, the owners of those securities would be the losers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In normal times, old securities with relatively high interest rates would have virtually disappeared as owners refinanced, paid off the old mortgages and took out loans at lower rates. But these are not normal times, and speculators now are profiting from the woes of homeowners who cannot refinance but have not defaulted. Because Fannie and Freddie guarantee the loans, buyers of those securities are sure to recover the amounts lent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of high-coupon mortgage securities rose to unprecedented heights earlier this year as investors concluded that those who had not refinanced by then would never be able to do so, and that owners of the securities would be able to collect above-market interest rates for a long time. Those prices have declined, but not by very much, since the administration announced its refinancing plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher J. Mayer, a professor at Columbia Business School who had been pushing to allow refinancings by underwater owners, says more is needed. He would like to see rule changes that would encourage competition for issuing such mortgages, rather than leaving it up to the bank that issued the original mortgage and that is still collecting fees from servicing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other things the government should be trying to do. Mr. Dudley says ways should be found to reduce foreclosures by providing ''bridge financing for borrowers with proven ability to service their debts who lose their jobs and may take longer than normal to find new jobs in today's weak labor market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dudley and other Fed officials have pushed for efforts to reduce the supply of homes for sale by turning some foreclosed properties into rental properties. The administration has asked for proposals on how that could be done, but has not announced any decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the current imbalance in supply and demand for homes, and relatively strong rental markets, such an idea seems obvious. But there seems to be no precedent. While there are of course large apartment complexes that are managed and rented by a single company, there is no business model that has been used to allow one manager to own and rent out a large number of homes. It would be particularly hard to do if the homes were spread over a large area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are neighborhoods where Fannie and Freddie own large numbers of foreclosed homes. It is at least conceivable they could package them and sell them in bulk to a company that could manage them efficiently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was, in part, unquestioning belief in the wisdom of markets that led the Fed, under Alan Greenspan, to refuse to take action that could have at least retarded the growth of the housing bubble. It would be unfortunate if such beliefs kept the government from heeding the pleas now coming from the Fed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over the medium term,'' said Ben Bernanke, Mr. Greenspan's successor as Fed chairman, in his August address to the annual Jackson Hole conference of central bankers, ''housing activity will stabilize and begin to grow again, if for no other reason than that ongoing population growth and household formation will ultimately demand it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Good, proactive housing policies,'' he added, ''could help speed that process.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March 2008, about nine months after he bought a steel-processing business, Precision Steel Services in Warren, Mich., for some $750,000, Shailesh Kumar went to two banks in search of a $350,000 loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wanted to expand the business and pay off a $290,000 debt he had with the seller, replacing an 8 percent, seven-year debt with a 6.5 percent, 20-year loan. ''It would have made a huge difference in terms of cash flow and growth capital,'' Mr. Kumar said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But both lenders he was negotiating with demanded that Mr. Kumar put up equity in his own home as collateral. Mr. Kumar hesitated, and then as 2008 wore on, he watched the value of his home fall to $330,000 from $425,000, wiping out all of his equity. Eventually, the banks broke off negotiations. With no cash on hand and revenue down by some 60 percent during the first half of 2009, Mr. Kumar closed Precision Steel in July 2009. Today, he runs an investment advice Web site, Value Stock Guide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapse of the housing market has highlighted how entrepreneurs are routinely compelled to bet the house on their businesses. For many, taking the risk is tempting because their home may be their largest asset and loans against home equity are easier to find than business loans. Also, such loans come at lower interest rates than most alternatives. They can also allow a business owner to avoid giving equity to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using data from Barlow Research Associates, a Minneapolis company that conducts quarterly financial surveys, Scott Shane, a professor at Case Western Reserve University, estimated that from 2001 to 2006, the percentage of small business owners who tapped their home equity for business, either by pledging their homes as collateral or by borrowing against home equity, rose to 27.5 percent from 18.4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, owners have no choice. The Small Business Administration's 7(a) loan program, for example, ''requires that if there is collateral available to make a fully secured loan, the bank lender has an obligation to get it as collateral,'' said Steven J. Smits, associate administrator for the office of capital access at the S.B.A. Many lenders require owners to show that they are serious by putting up cash -- often from home equity loans. ''The standard in the industry is lenders want skin in the game,'' Mr. Smits said, ''and 20 percent is a safe rule of thumb.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, however, the drop in home prices means that fewer owners have the home equity option. And while there is no way to determine the precise numbers, that drop has undoubtedly restricted the ability of owners to obtain financing to start, expand or maintain a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The biggest problem is that revenues of the great majority of small businesses have gone down from between 10 percent and 70 percent,'' said George Cloutier, founder of American Management Services, an Orlando, Fla., consulting firm that specializes in financial turnarounds for small and midsize companies. ''In normal times, there would be a movement to use home equity to shore up losses and sagging sales. The problem that has occurred is that no one's doing home equity loans, especially on marginal cases where the owner's business is in trouble.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some worry about the impact this inability to raise capital and start businesses and hire employees might have on the economy; others wonder whether it ever makes sense to demand this level of commitment from entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most start-ups in the U.S. economy are not suitable for venture capital finance,'' said David T. Robinson, a professor of finance at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke. ''So it's probably the best system we've got. But it's certainly an inefficient system, because if I have a great idea but no home, and you have a lot of home equity but no ideas,'' the two sides are out of luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many entrepreneurs, risking the house demonstrates a passion to succeed. Zalmi Duchman, 31, took a $100,000 home equity loan on his Surfside, Fla., condo and in 2006 used $5,000 of it to start the Fresh Diet, a gourmet meal-delivery service. (He used the rest for living expenses while building the business.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 18 months later he took out an additional $200,000 to match with a $900,000 S.B.A. loan that he used to buy a competitor with operations in Miami and New York. ''I don't think I would have gotten the S.B.A. loan without my condo,'' said Mr. Duchman, who expects the Fresh Diet to bring in $30 million in revenue this year. ''I wouldn't have grown the way I did.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others see taking money out of the house as excessively risky. Philip Patrick, founder of PharmaStrat, a pharmaceutical consulting firm in Flemington, N.J., started his company in 2002 with $5,000 and says he has had a profit since its first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, he sold his business, which had annual revenue of $5 million, without ever having borrowed against his house. ''I think some entrepreneurs, when looking for money, pitch that as a positive: 'Look how much faith I have! I'm betting down to the last nickel!' '' he said. ''But I think that's a negative. I don't want to invest in someone who's down to the last nickel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting the house can be especially uncomfortable for the spouses and families of entrepreneurs. After Rick Sanchez lost his job at a film postproduction house in 2006, he and his wife, Tara Zucker, decided to take $55,000 from a home equity line of credit to buy equipment and start their own postproduction business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Post Haste Media of North Hollywood, Calif., did well at first, and they were able to pay off half the loan. Then, in 2008, the economy declined and they had to take out more money. ''For me, it was an exciting prospect, though it was scary,'' said Mr. Sanchez, 58. ''For my wife, it was a lot more difficult. She's a lot more conservative with money and worries a lot more about it than I do. It took a lot of working on those issues between the two of us.'' When they paid off the loan in 2010, Mr. Sanchez said, ''it was a great relief.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not every loan has a happy ending. In 2001, Linda Frakes, of Cumming, Ga., decided to buy a franchise in the Curves health club chain. By 2004, she owned eight. But Curves began to fall out of favor, and in 2005, Ms. Frakes refinanced her home twice to take out $155,000 in home equity and invest it in keeping the franchises running while she tried to sell them. ''I was having trouble making payroll,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Frakes wound up selling her franchises for far less than the $150,000 to 200,000 she had expected to get for each of them. She eventually closed two locations and sold the remaining six in three sales for a total of $500,000. At the end, she was left with $80,000 in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laden with about $250,000 in business-related credit card debt on which she was paying $4,000 a month, a $3,500 mortgage payment, and little income, Ms. Frakes held on for about six months before she stopped making mortgage payments in spring 2008. She declared bankruptcy and then lost her home in late 2009. ''I explained to my son the 15-year-old's version of bankruptcy, and his only question was, 'Are we going to have enough money for food?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now 56, Ms. Frakes wrote a book about her experience and today owns Health Fairs Onsite, a company that puts on health fairs at corporate locations nationwide. It is 100 percent bootstrapped. ''I don't have any credit, you know?'' she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By MOTOKO RICH   </div><div>1529 words</div><div>30 November 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like millions of other homeowners, William D. Compton would like to refinance his mortgage so that he pays less each month for his three-bedroom house in Gulf Breeze, Fla. With the savings, he figures he could afford a few extra movies and restaurant dinners or he could buy a new stove and brakes for his car, purchases he has postponed because finances are so tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although he would appear to be a good candidate, Mr. Compton, 57, has been turned down twice for a federal refinancing program aimed at homeowners like him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he has renewed hope. That's because the government is expanding the Home Affordable Refinance Program, which was meant to help homeowners whose mortgages are backed by the government and whose home values have declined sharply, even below what the borrowers owe. Mr. Compton is one of those underwater homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Treasury Department announced the program, referred to as HARP, two years ago, it said it could help four million to five million homeowners whose home values had plunged. Yet just 900,000 borrowers -- whose loans are owned by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-sponsored housing finance companies -- have successfully refinanced through the program. Starting early next month, though, banks will begin using new criteria intended to make more borrowers eligible: raising the ceiling on how much owners can borrow over the value of their home as well as relaxing rules that might force banks to take back bad loans from the government. In announcing the change, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, which oversees <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, carefully eased expectations, suggesting about 900,000 more homeowners would be helped, roughly doubling the size of the program to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts welcomed the change, but some criticized it for still not capturing nearly enough of the people who could benefit from lower interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 22 million borrowers who could be eligible for the government refinancing program, nearly 70 percent of them are paying interest rates of 5 percent or more, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a research firm. Conventional mortgage rates are currently closer to 4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greater participation could help the beleaguered housing market, which showed renewed signs of decline in data released on Tuesday, as well as help shore up the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The universe is much larger than what has come through the pipeline,'' said Paul Ballew, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Nationwide Insurance</span>. Mr. Ballew said that if 10 million more people refinanced and saved an average of $200 a month, that would work out to be about $24 billion a year of additional spending power in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economists and officials of the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> say it is unrealistic to expect all those borrowers to refinance. Some people are wary of government programs, while others will be put off by upfront application fees and the paperwork burden. Those who have home equity loans or second mortgages could face tougher approvals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the refinancing program is optional, lenders may impose additional restrictions. What is more, it is costly to devote staff to refinancing applications, so lenders may simply be reluctant to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Compton has calculated that a refinancing would save him and his wife, Lynne, about $275 on their $1,397 monthly payment. He has not missed a payment, despite being laid off from one job and enduring two pay cuts in the last two years. His salary is now roughly two-thirds what it was when they bought the house five years ago -- a house that has since fallen in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan servicer, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, initially turned down the refinancing application because the Comptons had been living in another, smaller property they owned while renting out their main house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple moved back in September and reapplied after changing their drivers' licenses and utility bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, a loan officer told Mr. Compton, who works as a public transportation planner, that he did not qualify because his loan had been sold to two different investors. Mr. Compton said he confirmed through a government Web site that his loan was now owned solely by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It angers me quite a bit,'' said Mr. Compton, who added that unlike other borrowers, he never took out a home equity loan during the boom and has consistently paid his bills. The refinancing program, he said, should be ''a perfect fit for me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He suspects that Chase -- as well as other lenders -- believe ''that if you just tell people 'no' often enough, eventually they will just say O.K., and move on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After being asked about Mr. Compton's case, a Chase spokesman said the company was investigating his file. ''We are reaching out to the customer to see if we could refinance him through HARP 2,'' said the spokesman, referring to the expanded government program, ''or offer another option.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meg Burns, senior associate director for housing and regulatory policy at the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, said the agency could not control individual lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Burns said the new criteria were intended to ''serve these specific borrowers whose home values had declined and did not otherwise have access to a refinance or at a cost that we thought was reasonable.'' She added that the program was not meant to bolster the overall economy. (Separately, since April 2009, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> have refinanced eight million loans through other programs for borrowers who still have equity in their homes.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts complain that the new rules are too narrow to spur enough refinancings to actually help the economy. Christopher J. Mayer, a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School, said the new criteria would do little to encourage banks to compete for refinancing business. ''This was a program designed to be very small,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the program were to help far more borrowers refinance, some economists expect little increase in consumer demand. A much larger refinancing boom last decade led to a rise in consumer spending that was only ''modest and transitory,'' said Sam Khater, senior economist at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the savings from a refinancing may go toward paying off other debts or creating a cushion for lean times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took two years for Leslie Davidson, a consultant who helps companies produce audio and Web conferences, to refinance the mortgage on her townhouse in Pacifica, Calif. After spending more than $1,200 on appraisals and getting rejected by several lenders, Ms. Davidson finally got approved through the federal government refinancing program with her current servicer, <span class="companylink">CitiMortgage</span>, earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She reduced her monthly payments by nearly $400, and bought an Apple laptop. But she is mostly using the savings to pay off more loan principal each month and reduce the credit card debt that she racked up during the economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government officials say the main benefit of the expanded refinancing program is to reduce the likelihood that borrowers -- even those who have consistently made payments -- will eventually default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The economy is weak, and the unemployment rate is high, and sometimes bad things happen to good people,'' said Frank E. Nothaft, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. ''If they get hit with another whammy such as they lose their job,'' he added, ''they are more likely to go into delinquency and into foreclosure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some critics say the government's refinancing program sidesteps the fundamental problem that drives foreclosures, which is that close to 10.7 million borrowers -- more than a fifth of all mortgage holders -- owe more than their homes are worth. Many of them have already missed too many payments to be eligible for refinancing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has yet to see its bottom, and an increasing number of economists worry that depressed housing prices and underwater borrowers are holding back a broader recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the group we're trying to reach is those who are underwater,'' said Katherine Porter, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine who specializes in bankruptcy and mortgages, refinancing to lower monthly payments is ''a very odd mismatch between the problem and the solution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added: ''Don't get me wrong, that puts more dollars in families' pockets and may have a stimulus effect, but it's a very tangential way of addressing underwater homeowners.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: December 1, 2011, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the expansion of a federal program meant to help some homeowners whose home values have declined sharply misstated, in some editions, the amount of spending power that would be added to the American economy if 10 million more homeowners refinanced and saved an average of $200 a month. It is $24 billion, not $240 billion.</p>

</div><div class="author">By MATT HUDGINS   </div><div>1175 words</div><div>30 November 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lease renewal notices that landlords send out annually have contained little good news for renters in recent years: Rents are up and vacancies down around the country. And having resigned themselves to paying more, renters may wonder whether the new number on their lease was plucked out of thin air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rest assured, it was not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For about a decade the country's biggest landlords, who together control about a million rental apartments, have been using powerful software tools to set rental rates on new and renewing leases. Patterned after the technology used to price airline tickets and hotel rooms, the software weighs competitors' rental rates, market conditions, seasonal trends and hundreds of other variables to recommend the highest feasible rent for each apartment at a given time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology can benefit residents as well. Just as travelers can lower their airline fare by flying at off times, residents can often lock in lower monthly rents by agreeing to lease terms that help apartment owners avoid downtime or fill less popular units. Revenue management software can generate options for renters by varying rental rates, start dates and numbers of months on the lease -- and still hit a landlord's revenue target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now landlords with as few as 3,000 units are testing the technology, which is chiefly produced by two companies, the Rainmaker Group of Alpharetta, Ga., which sells a program called Rainmaker LRO (for lease rent options); and <span class="companylink">RealPage Inc</span>., of Carrollton, Tex., which calls its version YieldStar Price Optimizer. Both products incorporate data collected automatically from competitors along with masses of market and property information. YieldStar adds data from <span class="companylink">RealPage</span>'s market researcher, MPF Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Romano, the vice president of pricing and revenue management at <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, one of the largest publicly traded apartment owners in the United States, uses Rainmaker LRO at more than 100,000 apartment units in 15 states and the District of Columbia. There are exceptions, including complexes where subsidies impose rent parameters, and at rent-controlled properties in New York. The overall portfolio includes 8,290 units in the New York metro area, with 4,057 of those in New York City, <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the combination of rent and occupancy which produces revenue, so we're maximizing that optimum mix,'' said Mr. Romano, who joined <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> in 2004 to set up and run the centralized pricing system. ''We don't have occupancy targets per se. We let the system determine at what rate revenue is maximized at a given occupancy level.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords pay for an initial setup as well as a monthly subscription fee based on the number of units at each property. Neither software company would disclose rates, but clients said the costs were small relative to property budgets and potential income to be gained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're talking about $2 per unit, per month,'' said Steve Gilmore, a senior vice president of Shea Properties in Aliso Viejo, Calif., a diversified real estate company that uses YieldStar Price Optimizer at all of its 14 apartment properties and 6,000 units. Mr. Gilmore said the software paid for itself in about six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shea Properties had eschewed one-month leases, for example, before YieldStar began suggesting pricing options that made short-term deals worthwhile. At the Madrid Apartments in Mission Viejo, Calif., the company recently rented out a $1,200-a-month unit on a one-month lease for $3,000, a sum Mr. Gilmore says the company would not have thought to ask for before it began relying on revenue management software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue management is entrenched among apartment real estate investment trusts, or REITs, and has a growing following of smaller portfolio owners, said Steve Lefkovits, the president and chief executive of Joshua Tree Internet Media in Emeryville, Calif., which provides best-practice information to the multifamily industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of the public REITs except one use a revenue management software, and all of them use some type of revenue management strategy,'' said Mr. Lefkovits, who in September co-hosted with the National Apartment Association an industrywide apartment revenue management conference in Arizona that drew 263 participants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thing that was most interesting to me about this year's conference,'' Mr. Lefkovits said, ''was the number of smaller owner-operators, with 3,000 to 10,000 units, that have invested the time and energy into adopting a revenue-management strategy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greystar, a third-party apartment manager based in Charleston, S.C., has found that the apartment communities it prices with YieldStar Price Optimizer outperform the other properties in its portfolio by about 2.7 percent, said Tom Bumpass, the company's chief information officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've seen it work,'' Mr. Bumpass said, ''and we're encouraging others of our owners to move to this solution.'' Greystar uses YieldStar at 182 complexes with a total of about 70,000 units, or a third of its management portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In initial testing, <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> found it was able to raise revenue 3 to 5 percent at complexes using Rainmaker LRO, Mr. Romano said. That persuaded company leaders to buy the software for the entire portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those results are fairly typical for operators that adopt revenue management, said Robert G. Cross, the chairman and chief executive of Revenue Analytics Inc. in Atlanta. ''Across industries, you get a 3 percent to 7 percent increase in revenue and most of that goes to bottom line,'' said Mr. Cross. ''We've seen that in every industry we've been in, and the same is true for multifamily.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cross pioneered revenue management in the airline industry during the 1980s and 1990s before taking the concept to hotels and other sectors. In 1999, his company developed revenue management software for Archstone, owner of a large multifamily portfolio. Archstone later sold its rights to the software, which is now marketed and sold in updated form as LRO by Rainmaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from raising revenue, executives at both software providers said such gains had a multiplier effect on property value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $2 million improvement in annual rent, for example, would add approximately $40 million to the sale price of a property trading at a 5 percent capitalization rate. A capitalization rate is an investor's expected return on the purchase price in the first year after a sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily landlords say the systems have proved particularly useful with lease renewals, because it takes emotion out of the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now it's more about the analytics,'' said Bryan Pierce, the revenue manager at Holland Residential in Vancouver, Wash., which uses Rainmaker LRO at 63 of its 70 properties. ''Maybe this person is paying 15 percent below market, and as much as we love them, maybe it's time to let them move on and capture that 15 percent.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the housing bubble began to burst six years ago, prices nationwide have fallen by a third. Nearly $7 trillion of home equity has been wiped out. Currently, some 14.7 million homeowners owe $700 billion more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. Going forward, prices are likely to fall further as banks put a backlog of foreclosed properties on the market. As home prices fall and more homeowners sink underwater, there will be more foreclosures and more price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what is Mitt Romney's response? Bring it on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews and in the Republican presidential debates, Mr. Romney has said that the cure for foreclosures is for the government to get out of the way and let the process run its course. Once prices hit bottom, investors and want-to-be homeowners would presumably swoop in and prices would stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The argument might have some red-meat appeal, playing off the notion that any owners who lose their homes are getting what they deserve. It is wrong on several counts:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efficiency. Mass foreclosures are a rotten way to stabilize the market. They impose huge costs on neighbors, communities and local governments, and on the broader economy, as falling prices erode equity, depress consumer spending and mire the housing market in a deep hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Logic. Who does Mr. Romney think will buy up millions of foreclosed properties? Borrowers who lose their homes to foreclosure or who sell their homes for less than the balance on their mortgages can be denied credit for years; many will never be homeowners again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many college graduates, unable to find jobs, are moving in with their parents, not starting careers, not starting families and not becoming first-time home buyers. High school graduates are despairing of any economic toehold. Investors are inclined to buy distressed properties only if they believe home values will rise, a confidence that is hard to come by in a market that is threatened by more foreclosures and renewed price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Danger. With the economy still weak and vulnerable to shocks, more foreclosures and the resulting price declines would only weaken the economy further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fairness. The let-it-crash argument conveniently ignores that the housing bubble was the result not only of overborrowing but of reckless lending too. When the bubble burst, the banks were bailed out, while speculators and uncreditworthy borrowers -- whom lenders had aggressively pursued during the boom -- quickly began to lose their properties. But the economic damage went far beyond the ''bad'' borrowers, as evidenced by deep recession, ensuing slow growth, high unemployment and crashing home values -- all of which has now harmed millions of homeowners who never went near a subprime mortgage. They are the collateral damage of the banks' binge and bailout. They deserve help, not scorn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is not to say that every troubled borrower can be saved. Of the estimated 14.7 million underwater borrowers, 1.6 million are lost causes, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. Many have already abandoned their homes, leaving them vacant, or are hopelessly behind on their payments, often because of long-term unemployment. This group needs policies to help convert homes to rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another 1.6 million underwater borrowers have missed payments because of a setback, like job loss, that may prove temporary. They could be helped with forbearance, allowed to make no or reduced payments for a time, and make up the difference later, or with loan modifications that result in meaningfully smaller payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remaining 11.5 million underwater homeowners are current in their payments, but are at high risk of default, since they have no equity to cushion a financial setback and no incentive to keep paying, especially if prices go down again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loan modifications that reduce principal balances are the best solution, because they restore equity and reduce monthly payments. The banks would take a hit on principal write-downs. So be it. Refinancings, which the Obama administration is in the process of expanding, also help, because a new loan with a lower rate makes staying in the home more affordable. Mr. Romney has said refinancing is ''worth further consideration.'' Investors in mortgage-backed securities will take a hit on refinancings. So be it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a recent debate, Mr. Romney was asked why he was willing to risk further huge losses in home equity by pushing foreclosures. ''What would you do instead?'' he replied. ''Have the federal government go out and buy all the homes in America?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one is suggesting that. What is needed is a set of policies -- rentals, forbearance, principal write-downs and refinancings -- on a scale that tackles the problem.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans who bought previously occupied homes rose slightly last month but remained at depressed levels. And more deals are being canceled at the last minute, a sign that even those who are looking to buy are worried about the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rose 1.4 percent in October, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.97 million, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. That's below the 6 million that economists say is consistent with a healthy housing market and slightly ahead of last year's sales -- the worst in 13 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales are measured when buyers close on the homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many deals are falling apart before that point. One third of Realtors say they have had at least one contract scuttled in October, up from 18 percent in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contracts have been canceled for a number of reasons: Banks have declined mortgage applications; home inspectors have found problems; appraisals showed a home was worth less than the bid; a buyer lost a job before the closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the October increase in home sales beat analysts' expectations. Some economists took that as a positive sign for the troubled market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are not looking for a housing renaissance, but the straws in the wind suggest that activity in the sector might be improving slightly,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity among first-time buyers rose slightly last month to make up 34 percent of sales. That's up from 32 percent in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, homes at risk of foreclosure made up 28 percent of sales last month. That's down from 30 percent in September. Many of the sales went to investors, who are increasingly buying homes priced under $100,000. Sales in that category have increased more than 24 percent over the last year while sales of more expensive homes have fallen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price dropped about 2 percent, to $162,500, in October.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people applying for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since early April, a sign that layoffs were easing and that hiring might pick up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a Commerce Department report said that builders started slightly fewer homes in October but submitted plans for a wave of apartments, a mixed sign for the struggling housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weekly applications for jobless benefits dropped by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 388,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. It was the fourth decline in five weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week average, a less volatile measure, dropped to 396,750. That is the first time the average been below 400,000 in seven months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications need to consistently drop below 375,000 to signal sustained job gains. They have not fallen that low since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job market ''is still weak but there are hopeful signs of some modest improvement,'' Steven A. Wood, an economist at Insight Economics, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people receiving benefits also fell to the lowest level since September 2008, when <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed and the financial crisis intensified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benefit rolls fell 57,000 to 3.6 million in the week ended Nov. 5. That is one week behind the applications data. The figure is the lowest since Sept. 20, 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That does not include about three million additional people receiving extended benefits from emergency programs put in place during the recession. All told, 6.8 million people received benefits during the week ended Oct. 29, the latest data available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rebound in manufacturing could lead to more hiring. Factory output grew in October for the fourth straight month, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. Production of trucks, electronics and business equipment all rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report on Thursday from the Commerce Department showed that home builders broke ground on a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 628,000 homes last month. That is roughly half the 1.2 million that economists equate with a healthy housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But building permits, a gauge of future construction, rose nearly 11 percent. The increase was spurred by a 30 percent increase in apartment permits, which reached its highest level in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last year, apartment permits have surged roughly 63 percent. Permits for single-family homes have increased just 6.6 percent in that span.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting has become a preferred option for many Americans who lost their jobs during the recession and were forced to leave their homes. The surge in apartment construction may help increase economic growth, but it has not been enough to offset the steep declines in single-family homebuilding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction starts of single-family homes, which make up about 70 percent of residential home construction, rose nearly 4 percent last month. Starts for apartments, a more volatile category, fell more than 13 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, homebuilding dipped in 2009 to just 554,000 homes, the lowest levels in 50 years. Last year the figure rose to roughly 587,000 homes and this year may not be much better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though new homes represent just 20 percent of the overall home market, they have an outsize impact on the economy. Each home built creates an average of three jobs for a year and generates about $90,000 in taxes, according to the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After previous recessions, housing accounted for at least 15 percent of economic growth in the United States. Since the recession officially ended in June 2009, it has contributed just 4 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARIA BARTIROMO: Throughout the evening tonight, we'll be joinedby an all-star line-up of the smartest people on CNBC. First uptonight: Jim Cramer, the host of ''Mad Money.'' Jim, welcome.(Cheers, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JIM CRAMER: Thank you, Maria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JOHN HARWOOD: And we also want to hear your voice. Go to ourwebsite, debate.cnbc.com, and tweet us at hashtag CNBCdebate. All</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">night we'll be showing your tweets on the bottom of the screen, so allthe candidates will have even more of a motive to impress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: In the interest of time, the candidates haveagreed to forgo opening and closing statements tonight. So let's getstarted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we begin with you, Mr. Cain. I want to begin with what wesaw today, another rough day for our money, for our 401(k)s. Onceagain we were all impacted by the news that the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage dropped 400 points today. The reason: Italy is on the brinkof financial disaster. It is the world's seventh-largest economy. Aspresident, what will you do to make sure their problems do not takedown the U.S. financial system?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HERMAN CAIN: Let's start with two things. First, we must growthis economy. We are the biggest economy in the world, and as long aswe are stagnant in terms of growth in GDP, we impact the rest of theworld. We must do that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we're not going to be able to do that until we put some fuelin the engine that drives economic growth, which is the businesssector. This administration has done nothing but put stuff in thecaboose, and it's not moving this economy. We must grow this economy,number one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Number two, we must assure that our currency is sound. Just like -- a dollar must be a dollar when we wake up in the morning. Justlike 60 minutes is in an hour, a dollar must be a dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we are growing this economy the way it has the ability to do, andat the same time we are cutting spending seriously, we will havethings moving in the right direction in order to be able to survivethese kind of (ripple effects ?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: So to be clear: Focus on the domestic economy;allow Italy to fail?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: Focus on the domestic economy, or we will fail. So,yes, focus on the domestic economy first. There's not a lot that theUnited States can directly do for Italy right now because they have -- they're really way beyond the point of return that we -- we as theUnited States can save them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Governor Romney, should we allow Italy to fail?Should we have a stake in what's going on in the eurozone right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MITT ROMNEY: Well, Europe is able to take care of their ownproblems. We don't want to step in and try and bail out their banksand bail out their governments. They have the capacity to deal withthat themselves. They're a very large economy. And there will be,I'm sure, cries if Italy does default, if Italy does get in trouble,and we don't know that'll happen. But if they get to a point wherethey're in crisis and banks throughout Europe could hold a lot ofItaly debt, we'll -- we'll then face crisis. And there'll have to besome kind of effort to try and uphold their financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will be some who say here that banks in the U.S. that haveItalian debt -- that we ought to help those as well. My view is, no,no, no. We do not need to step in to bail out banks either in Europeor banks here in the U.S. that may have Italian debt. The rightanswer is for us -- (applause) --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: But the U.S. does contribute to the InternationalMonetary Fund, and the IMF has given $150 billion to the eurozone.Are you saying the U.S. should stop contributing to the IMF?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: I'm happy to continue to participate in worldefforts like the World Bank and the IMF. But I'm not happy to havethe United States government put in place a TARP-like program to tryand save U.S. banks that have Italian debt, foreign banks doingbusiness in the U.S. that have Italian debt, or European debt -- we'rejust -- of banks there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's going to be an effort to try and draw us in and talkabout how we need to help -- help Italy and help Europe. Europe isable to help Europe. We have to focus on getting our own economy inorder and making sure we never reach the kind of problem Italy ishaving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we stay on the course we're on, with the level of borrowingthis administration is carrying out, if we don't get serious aboutcutting and capping our spending and balancing our budget, you'regoing to find America in the same position Italy is in four or fiveyears from now, and that is unacceptable. We got to fix our -- ourdeficit here. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JIM CRAMER: Congressman Paul. (Inaudible) -- to say. You know,I really get that. But I'm on the front lines of the stock market.We were down 400 points today. We're not going to be done going downif this keeps going up, if Italy keeps -- the rate keeps going up.Surely you must recognize that this is a moment-to-moment situationfor people who have 401(k)s and IRAs and the like, and you wouldn'tjust let it fail, just go away and take our banking system with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REPRESENTATIVE RON PAUL (R-TX): No, you don't. You have to letit -- you have to let it liquidate. We've had -- we took 40 years tobuild up this worldwide debt. We're in a debt crisis never seenbefore in our history. The sovereign debt of this world is equal tothe GDP, as ours is in this country. If you prop it up, you'll doexactly what we did in the Depression, prolong the agony. If you do -- if you prop it up, you do what Japan has done for 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, yes, you want to liquidate the debt. The debt isunsustainable. And this bubble was predictable because 40 years ago,we had no restraints whatsoever on the monetary authorities and wepiled debt on debt, we pyramided debt, we had no restraints on thespending. And if you keep bailing people out and prop it up, you justprolong the agony, as we're doing in the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now Fannie May and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> are demanding more moneybecause we don't allow the market to determine what these mortgagesare worth. If you don't liquidate this and clear the market, believeme, you're going to perpetuate this for a decade or two more, and thatis very, very dangerous. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CRAMER: Governor Huntsman. (Inaudible.) Italy's too big tofail. It's great. I would love it if we were independent. It wouldbe terrific (to say it's your fault ?), it's your fault and it's yourproblem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if this goes, the world banking system could shut down. Doesn'tthat involve our banks, too?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JON HUNTSMAN: So we wake up this morning, and we find that theyield curve with respect to Italy is up and prices are down. So ifyou want a window into what this country is going to look like in thefuture if we don't get on top of our debt, you're seeing it playingout in Europe right now. You're seeing the metastasy effect of thebanking sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what does it mean here? What am I most concerned about, Jim?I'm concerned that it impacts us in a way that moves into our bankingsector, where we've got a huge problem called ''too big to fail'' inthis country. We have six banks in this country that, combined, haveassets worth 66 percent of our nation's GDP, $9.4 trillion. Theseinstitutions get hit, they have an implied bailout by the taxpayers inthis country. And that means we're setting ourselves up for disasteragain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim, as long as we have banks that are too big to fail in thiscountry, we're going to catch the contagion, and it's going to hurtus. We've got to get back to a day and age where we have properly-sized banks and financial institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JOHN HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governor Romney, I want to switch to the bailout drama that we'velived through in this country, and no state understands it better thanthe state of Michigan. I'm going to talk a little bit about yourrecord on that. Four years ago when you were running for theRepublican nomination and the auto industry was suffering, you said,where's Washington? After the election, when the Bush administrationwas considering financial assistance for the automakers, you said no,let Detroit go bankrupt. Now that the companies are profitable againafter a bailout supported by your Republican governor here inMichigan, you said, well, actually, President Obama implemented myplan all along, or he gravitated to my plan. With a record like thatof seeming to be on all sides of the issue, why should Republicans beconfident in the steadiness of your economic leadership?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: John, I care about about this state and about theauto industry like -- I'd guess like no one else on this stage, havingbeen born and raised here, watched my parents make their life here. Iwas here in the 1950s and 1960s when Detroit and Michigan was thepride of the nation. I've seen this industry and I've seen this statego through tough times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And my view some years ago was that the federal government, byputting in place CAFE requirements that helped foreign automobilesgain market share in the U.S., was hurting Detroit. And so I said,where is -- where is Washington? They're not doing the job they oughtto be doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My view with regards to the bailout was that whether it was byPresident Bush or by President Obama, it was the wrong way to go. Isaid from the very beginning they should go through a managedbankruptcy process, a private bankruptcy process. We have capitalmarkets and bankruptcy. It works in the U.S. The idea of billions ofdollars being wasted initially -- then finally they adopted themanaged bankruptcy. I was among others that said we ought to do that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then after that, they gave the company to the UAW, they gaveGeneral Motors to the UAW, and they gave Chrysler to Fiat. My plan,we would have had a private sector bailout with the right -- privatesector restructuring and bankruptcy with the private sector guidingthe -- the direction, as opposed to what we had with the governmentplaying its heavy hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Governor, let me follow up, because -- (applause) -- the auto bailout is part of a larger issue facing your candidacy,as you know. Your opponents have said you've switched positions onmany issues. It's an issue of character -- not personal, butpolitical. You seemed to encapsulate it in what -- the last debatewhen you said: I'm running for office, for Pete's sake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What can you say to Republicans to persuade them the things yousay in the campaign are rooted in something deeper than the fact thatyou're running for office?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: I think -- John, I think people know me pretty well,particularly in this state, in the state of Massachusetts, NewHampshire that's close by, Utah where I (served in ?) the Olympics. Ithink people understand that I'm a man of steadiness and constancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't think you're going to find somebody who has more of thoseattributes than I do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've been married to the same woman for 25 -- excuse me -- (chuckles) I get in trouble -- for 42 years. (Laughter.) I've -- I've been in the same church my entire life. I worked at one company,Bain, for 25 years, and I left that to go up and -- off and help savethe Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think it's outrageous the Obama campaign continues to push thisidea when you have in the Obama administration the most politicalpresidency we've seen in modern history. They're actually decidingwhen to pull out of Afghanistan based on politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let me tell you this. If I'm president of the United States, Iwill be true to my family, to my faith and to our country, and I willnever apologize for the United States of America. That's my belief.(Cheers, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Now, Governor Perry, I want to ask you about this,because you've raised this issue yourself about Governor Romney, andyou're running as a politician with strong convictions. From the flipside, Ronald Reagan raised taxes when the deficit got too big. GeorgeW. Bush supported TARP and the auto bailout when he thought we mightface a Great Depression -- second Great Depression. Does that,examples like that, tell you that good, effective leaders need to showthe kind of flexibility that Governor Romney has showed on someissues?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOVERNOR RICK PERRY (R-TX): The next president of the UnitedStates needs to send a powerful message not just to the people of thiscountry but around the world that America is going to be Americaagain; that we are not going to pick winners and losers fromWashington, D.C.; that we're going to trust the capital markets andthe private sector to make the decisions and let the consumers pickwinners and losers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it doesn't make any difference whether it's Wall Street orwhether it's some corporate entity or whether it's some Europeancountry. If you are too big to fail, you are too big. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Speaker Gingrich, Federal Reserve Chairman BenBernanke has called the unemployment in this country a national crisisdue to the amount of days people are out -- months that people are outof work and the number of people out of work. Many of you have comeup with tax reform plans. Why is tax reform the path to job creation?And if it's not the only path, what else can you implement to getpeople back to work?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEWT GINGRICH: Well, first of all, I think Ben Bernanke is alarge part of the problem and ought to be fired as rapidly aspossible. (Cheers, applause.) I think the Federal Reserve ought tobe audited, and we should have all the decision documents for 2008, '9and '10 so we can understand who he bailed out, why he bailed themout, who he did not bail out and why he did not bail them out.(Cheers, applause.) So I'm -- I'm glad that Ben Bernanke recognizessome of the wreckage his policies have led to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've -- the reason we follow -- I think most of us are for taxpolicies that lead to jobs is because we've had two cycles in mylifetime, Ronald Reagan and the Contract with America, both of whichhad the same policies: lower taxes, less regulation, more Americanenergy, and have faith in the American job creator, as distinct from aSaul Alinsky radicalism of higher taxes, bigger bureaucracy with moreregulations, no American energy -- as the president announced againtoday in his decision on offshore -- and finally, class warfare. So Iwould say that all of us on this stage represent a dramaticallygreater likelihood of getting to a paycheck and leaving behind foodstamps than does Barack Obama. (Cheers, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Congressman Bachmann, same question to you. Howcan you create jobs as quickly as possible?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REPRESENTATIVE MICHELE BACHMANN (R-MN): Well, I think one thingthat we know is that taxes lead to jobs leaving the country. All youneed to know is that we have the second-highest corporate tax rate inthe world. And if you go back to 1981 and you look around the world,we had a lot of high corporate tax countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was 47 percent, on average, on a lot of countries across the world.But if you look today in the United States, we have an effective rate,if you average in state taxes with federal taxes, of about 40 percent;but the world took a -- took a clue. Because capital is mobile, andcapital went to places where corporate tax rates went to 25 percentand falling. We're still stuck in a 1986 era of about a 40-percenttax rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have to lower the tax rate, because of the cost of doingbusiness, but we have to do so much more than that. We -- our biggestproblem right now is our regulatory burden. The biggest regulatoryproblem we have is ''Obamacare'' and Dodd-Frank. I will repeal thosebills. I've written those bills to repeal those bills. They gottago. But beyond that -- (cheers, applause) -- but beyond that, we haveto legalize American energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And here's something else that we have to do that will help theeconomy. We have to build the fence on America's southern border andget a grip on dealing with our immigration problem. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: OK.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Senator Santorum, you've proposed a zero tax onmanufacturing businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RICK SANTORUM: I have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: All right. I understand the sentiment behind that,and the state of Michigan's lost hundreds of thousands ofmanufacturing jobs over the last few decades. Isn't that the kind ofdistortion in the tax code that people want to get away from in orderto get rates down -- flatter, simpler, fairer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SANTORUM: I think getting the rate down to zero is down -- is pretty far down. That's good. It's down to zero -- (inaudible) --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: But it's down for the manufacturing industry, asopposed to people doing other things. Isn't that picking winners andlosers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SANTORUM: It's down for a sector of the economy, not pickingan individual winner or loser. It's down for an entire sector of theeconomy, that we're getting our hat handed to us by losing jobs. I -- we see that here in Michigan; we see it across this country. And the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">reason is government has made us uncompetitive. We need to compete ontaxes. We need to compete on regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need to repeal ''Obamacare.'' I've said I'm going to repeal everysingle Obama-era regulation that costs business over a hundred milliondollars. Repeal them all. We'll save -- we'll send a very clearmessage out to manufacturers in this country and all over the worldthat America will compete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some have suggested we need to go into a trade war with China andhave tariffs. That just taxes you. I don't want to tax you. I wantto create an atmosphere where businesses and manufacturers can beprofitable. Lower taxes, repatriating funds, zero percent tax if yourepatriate those funds and invest them in plant and equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then of course an energy policy that everyone on this stageis going to agree with, that says we are going to produce energy inthis country. I'm different than many of them, that -- I'm going tocut all the subsidies out and let the market work, as opposed tocreating incentives for different forms of energy that the governmentsupports. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: You have all said that you will repeal thepresident's health care legislation. We will get into that because wewant to know, then what? What is the plan once you repeal''Obamacare?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first, Mr. Cain, the American people want jobs but they alsowant leadership. They want character in a president. In recent days,we have learned that four different women have accused you ofinappropriate behavior. Here we're focusing on character and onjudgement. (Boos.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You've been a CEO. (Boos.) You know that shareholders arereluctant to hire a CEO where there are character issues. Why shouldthe American people hire a president if they feel there are characterissues?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: The American people deserve better than someone beingtried in the court of public opinion based on unfounded accusations.(Cheers, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I value my character and my integrity more than anythingelse. And for every one person that comes forward with a falseaccusation, there are probably -- there are thousands who would saynone of that sort of activity ever came from Herman Cain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You're right, this country's looking for leadership. And this is whya lot of people, despite what has happened over the last nine days,are still very enthusiastic behind my candidacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last nine days -- (applause) -- over the last nine days,the voters have voted with their dollars, and they're saying theydon't care about the character assassination, they care aboutleadership and getting this economy growing and all of the otherproblems we face. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Governor Romney, when you were at <span class="companylink">Bain Capital</span>, youpurchased a lot of companies. You could fire the CEO and themanagement team or you could keep them. Would you keep a CEO -- areyou persuaded by what Mr. Cain has said? Would you keep him on if youhad bought his company? (Boos.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: I'm -- look. Look, Herman Cain is the person torespond to these questions. He just did. The people in this room andacross the country can make their own assessment. I'm not going to -- (applause) -- inaudible). (Extended cheers and applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Governor Huntsman, let me switch back to theeconomy. (Cheers, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Republicans have criticized the Occupy Wall Street movement.Well, we have have an NBC News/Wall Street poll this week that showeda large proportion of the American people, 76 percent, said theybelieve there's something wrong with our economy that tilts toward thewealthy at the expense of others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you consider something wrong with the structure of our economyand the income inequality that it produces? Is that somethinggovernment should do something about?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if so, what?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JON HUNTSMAN: Let me just say that I want to be the president ofthe 99 percent. I also want to be the president of the 1 percent.This nation is divided, and it's painful, and it is unnatural for themost optimistic blue-sky people this world has ever known. We areproblem solvers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I hear out the people who are part of the Wall Streetprotests, I (say ?) thank goodness we have the ability to speak out.I might not agree with everything they say. I don't like the anti-capitalism messages. But I do agree that this country is never againgoing to bail out corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I do agree -- (applause) -- thank you. I do agree that we haveblown through trillions and trillions of dollars with nothing to showon the balance sheet but debt and no uplift in our ability to competeand no addressing our level of unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I do agree that we have institutions, banks, that are too bigto fail in this country, and until we address that problem -- we canfix taxes, we can fix the regulatory environment, we can move towardenergy independence; so long as we have instant banks that are too bigto fail, we are setting ourselves up for long-term disaster andfailure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: So, Governor, you agree with Governor Romney thatthe bailout that Governor Snyder supports in Michigan was a mistake?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HUNTSMAN: The bailout here in the auto sector, $68 billionworth -- we're going to end up footing a bill -- Governor Snyder knowsthat -- of probably $15 billion when all is said and done. I don'tthink that's a good use of taxpayer money. Instead there ought to besome way of taking the auto sector through some sort ofreorganization, get them back on their feet. The people in thiscountry are sick and tired of seeing taxpayer dollars go towardbailouts and we're not going to have it anymore in this country.(Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CRAMER: Governor Romney, do you believe public companieshave any social responsibility to create jobs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or do you believe, as Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, the mostimportant, most influential conservative economist of the 20th centuryheld, that corporations should exist solely to create maximum profitfor their shareholders?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: This is a wonderful philosophical debate, but youknow what? We -- we don't have to decide between the two because theygo together. Our Democratic friends think that when a corporation isprofitable, that's a bad thing. I remember asking some, where do youthink -- where do you think profits go? When you hear that a companyis profitable, where do you think it goes? And they said, well, topay the executives their big bonuses. I said no, actually, none of itgoes to pay the executives. Profit is what's left over after they'veall been paid. What happens with profit is that you can grow thebusiness. You can expand it. You add working capital, and you hirepeople.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The right thing for America is to have profitable enterprisesthat can hire people. I want to make American businesses successfuland thrive. What we have in Washington today is a president and anadministration that doesn't like business, that somehow thinks theywant jobs, but they don't like businesses. Look, I want to see ourbusinesses thrive and grow and expand and be profitable. (Cheers,applause.) I want to see -- (inaudible) -- I want a (job ?) --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CRAMER: Governor Perry, 30 seconds to you. Do you thinkthat companies can both be profitable and be able to create jobs? Doyou think it's a dichotomy, or do you think they can do it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: They better be. They better be, and that's thereason the tax plan that I laid out, a 20 percent flat tax on thepersonal side and a 20 percent corporate tax rate -- that will getpeople working in this country. (Applause.) We need to go out thereand stick a big old flag in the middle of America that says, ''Open forbusiness again.'' (Cheers, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CRAMER: Mr. Speaker, how about to you? Can corporations doboth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: Look, obviously, corporations can and should doboth. And what is amazing to me is the inability of much of ouracademic world and much of our news media and most of the people onOccupy Wall Street to have a clue about history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Cheers, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this town, Henry Ford started as an Edison Electric supervisorwho went home at night and built his first car in the garage. Now,was he in the 99 percent, or the 1 percent? Bill Gates drops out ofcollege to found <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>. Is he in the 1 percent, or the 99percent?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, this is the richest country in the history of theworld because corporations succeed in creating both profits and jobs.And it's sad that the news media doesn't report accurately how theeconomy works. (Cheers, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: (Inaudible) -- I'd like to know what the -- Mr.Speaker, I'm sorry, but what is the media -- what is the mediareporting inaccurately about the economy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: What? (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: What is the media reporting inaccurately aboutthe economy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: (I love humor disguised as a question ?). That'sterrific. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have yet to hear a single reporter ask a single Occupy WallStreet person a single rational question about the economy that wouldlead them to say, for example: Who's going to pay for the park you'reoccupying if there are no businesses making a profit? (Cheers,applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CRAMER: Senator Santorum, I want to talk about a high-quality problem our country has. I just came back from North Dakota.We have made the largest oil discovery in a generation there. Notonly is it a -- defined a big step toward creating energyindependence, it stands to create as many as 300,000 jobs. But whatthe guys tell me up there is that they can't handle the rush withoutfederal help. Would you favor incentives -- incentives to get workersand businesses to where the jobs are -- to support this boom?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SANTORUM: No, because we've done it in Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania has Marcellus shale. It took a while for us to ramp up,but we're drilling 3(,000) to 4,000 wells. The price of natural gas,because of Marcellus shale -- which is the second largest natural gas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">find in the world -- has gone from $12 to $3.65. And we let themarketplace work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So no, we didn't have the federal government come in and bail us out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I want to make the point about manufacturing jobs again, becauseif you're -- if you're talking about creating jobs that trickle down,I agree with Newt. We have folks who have (sic) innovators. But healways -- he talked about innovators that created jobs for blue-collarworkers. The unemployment rate among non-college-educated is wellinto the double digits in America. It's 4 or 5 percent for people whohave college degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason I put forth this manufacturing point is not just so wecan say ''made here in America.'' That we can create opportunities foreveryone in America, including those that don't have that collegeskill set. People who built this country, like my grandfather who wasa coal miner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So that is a very important part that Republicans, unfortunately,are not talking about. We need to talk about income mobility. Weneed to talk about people at the bottom of the -- of the income scalebeing able to get necessary skills and rise so they can supportthemselves and a family. And that's what manufacturing does, andthat's why I'm laser-beam focused on it. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Let's get back to tax reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cain, let's talk fairness in taxation. Ever since thiscountry started taxing income a hundred years ago, our system chargesthose people who make more money a higher rate than those people whomake less money. Governor Perry has said he doesn't believe in thatapproach, and your 9-9-9 plan suggests you don't either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why now, when the higher-income group is doing better than therest of America, is the time to switch to the same rate for all of us?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: My proposal is the only one that solves the problem bythrowing out the current tax code, which has been a mess for decades -- (applause) -- and we need to put in something different that I'veproposed: 9-9-9. It satisfies five simple criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is simple. The complexity costs us $430 billion a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is transparent. People know what it is. There are thousandsof hidden ''sneak attaxes'' in the current tax code. That's why I wantto throw it out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is fair. The reason it's fair is because of the definition inWebster, which says everybody gets treated the same, all businessesget treated the same, not having Washington, D.C., pick winners andlosers. This is why I have proposed a bold plan of 9-9-9: 9 percentbusiness flat tax, 9 percent tax on personal income, a 9-percentnational sales tax. It treats everybody the same. And it will boostthis economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: How do you ensure that when the government needsmore revenue, that the sales tax doesn't go up and that plan doesn'tturn into 19-19-19?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: Tax codes do not raise taxes, politicians do.(Cheers, applause.) And as long as it's visible, the people will holdthe politicians' feet to the fire. It's not the code that raisestaxes, it's the politicians. Because the code -- because the approach9-9-9 will be very visible, the American people are going to hold therates at 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Governor Romney, Mr. Cain's got a flat tax, RickPerry's got a flat tax, Congresswoman Bachmann is talking about a flattax. You don't have a flat tax. You're proposing to preserve theBush era tax rates. What is wrong with the idea that we should go toone rate? Why do you believe in a progressive tax system?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: Well, I would like to see our tax rates flatter.I'd like to see our code simpler. I'd like to see the special breaksthat we have in the code taken out. That's one of the reasons why I'dtake the corporate rate from 35 down to 25, is to take out some of thespecial deals that are there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With regards to our tax code, what I want to do is to take ourprecious dollars as a nation and focus them on the people in thiscountry that have been hurt the most, and that's the middle class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama economy has really crushed middle-income Americans. Thispresident has failed us so badly. We have 26 million people out ofwork or in part-time jobs, that need full-time work or have stoppedlooking for work altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median incomes have dropped 10 percent in the last three years.At the same time, gasoline prices are up, food prices are up, healthcare costs are up. And so what I want to do is help the people who'vebeen hurt the most. And that's the middle class. And so what I do isfocus a substantial tax break on middle-income Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, I'd love to see if -- see us come up with a plan thatsimplifies the code and lowers rates for everybody. But right now,let's get the job done first that has to be done immediately. Let'slower the tax rates on middle-income Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Congresswoman Bachmann, Governor Romney isaccepting -- (applause) -- the premises of the Democratic argumentthat you have to have a fair approach to taxation that preservesdifferent rates for different people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is he wrong?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. BACHMANN: Well, I would say President Obama is the onethat's wrong, because President Obama's plan for job creation hasabsolutely nothing to do with the true people who know how to createjobs. He should really be going to job creators if he wants to knowhow to create jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he continues to go to General Axelrod in Chicago to lookfor his orders to figure out how to deal with the economy. That won'twork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We know what needs to be done. We have a real problem. When youhave 53 percent of Americans paying federal income taxes, but you have47 percent of Americans who pay no federal income taxes, you have areal problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's why in my tax plan, I have everyone paying something,because everyone benefits by this magnificent country. So even if itmeans paying the price of two Happy Meals a year, like $10, everyonecan afford to pay at least that. And what it does is create amentality in the United States that says that freedom is free. Butfreedom isn't free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We all benefit. We all need to sacrifice. Everybody has to be a partof this tax code. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Congressman Ron Paul, you have said you want toclose down agencies. Tell us about your tax plan, as well as closingagencies, federal agencies. Where do those jobs go?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. PAUL: Well, eventually they go into the private sector.They don't all leave immediately when the plan goes into effect.(Scattered applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what my plan does is, it addresses taxes in a littledifferent way. We're talking about the tax code, but that's theconsequence, that's the symptoms. The disease is spending. Everytime you spend -- (scattered applause) -- spending is a tax. We taxthe people, we borrow, and then we print the money, and then theprices go up, and that is a tax. So you have to address the subjectof spending. That is the tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the reason I go after the spending. I propose in thefirst year cut $1 trillion out of the budget -- (cheers, applause) -- in five departments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the -- the other thing is -- that you must do if you want toget the economy going and growing again is you have to get rid ofprice fixing. And the most significant price fixing that goes on, thatgave us the bubble, destroyed the economy and is preventing this fromcoming out is the price fixing of the Federal Reserve manipulatinginterest rates way below market rates. (Applause.) You have to havethe market determine interest rates if you want a healthy, viableeconomy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: So you think the economy would be stronger ifinterest rates were higher right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. PAUL: You would have -- you would have more incentive. Youwould take care of the elderly. They get cheated. They get nothingfor their CDs. Why -- why cheat them and give the banks loans at 0percent? Then they loan it back to the government at 3 percent.They're ripping us off at the expense of those on fixed incomes andthen retirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Even though higher interest rates would make itmuch more expensive to borrow mortgages, borrow --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. PAUL: But what you want is the market to determine this.Whoever thought that one person, the Federal Reserve Board chairman,knows what the money supply should be? Just in the past six months,M1 has gone up at the rate of 30 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That spells inflation. That spells lower standard of living andhigher prices. And watch out, they're coming. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: We are just getting started tonight. When wereturn, how will the candidates breathe new life into the lifelesshousing market?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governor Romney has said that the government should let theforeclosure process play out so that the housing market can recoverand the free markets can work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaker Gingrich, is Governor Romney right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: Well, he's certainly right in the sense that youwant to get through to the real value of the houses as fast as youcan, because they're not going to rise in value as long as you staytrapped, as Japan has done now for 20 years. But I think there aretwo specific steps you got to understand in terms of housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To pick up on something Congresswoman Bachmann said, if theRepublican House next week would repeal Dodd-Frank and allow us to putpressure on the Senate to repeal Dodd-Frank, you'd see the housingmarket start to improve overnight. Dodd-Frank kills small banks; itkills small business. The federal regulators are anti-housing loan.And it has maximized the pain level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You could also change some of the rules so that it would beeasier to do a short sale, where the house is worth less than themortgage, than it is to do a foreclosure. Today the banks areactually profiting more by foreclosing than by encouraging shortsales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the long run, you want the housing market to come back?the economy has to come back. When you're at 4-percent unemployment,you suddenly have a dramatic increase in demand for housing. Whenyou're at 9- percent-plus unemployment, it's hard to get the housingmarket to come back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Governor Romney, respond in 30 seconds. Not oneof your 59 points in your economic plan mentions or addresses housing.Can you tell us why?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: Yeah, because it's not a housing plan, it's a jobsplan. And the right way to get -- (cheers, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best -- the best thing you can do for housing is to get theeconomy going, get have people working again, seeing incomes, insteadof going down, incomes coming up so people can afford to buy homes.The things the speaker just indicated are excellent ideas as well.You have to let the market work and get people in homes again, and thebest way for that to happen is to -- is to allow this economy toreboot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we know won't work is what this president has done, which isto try and hold off the foreclosure process, the normal marketprocess, to -- to put money into a stimulus that failed and to put inplace a whole series of policies from ''Obamacare'' to Dodd-Frank thathave made it harder for this economy to get going. You want to getAmerica's economy going, we know how to do it. It's do almost theexact opposite of what President Obama has done. (Cheers, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Off-mic exchange.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LIESMAN: Governor Romney, we've created 2.7 million jobssince February 2010. Over that period of time, the housing market hascontinued to decline. We're at 2003 price levels now. If we keepgoing the way we're going, in four or five years we'll be at 1999price levels. The $7 trillion figure that Maria mentioned couldalmost double. Are you willing to let that happen in America?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: And exactly what you -- what would you do instead?Would you decide to have --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LIESMAN: I'm asking you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: -- have -- to have the federal government go out andbuy all the homes in America? That -- that's not going to happen inthis country. Markets work. When you have government play its heavyhand, markets blow up, and people get hurt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the reason we have the housing crisis we have is that thefederal government played too heavy a role in our markets. Thefederal government came in with <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> -- (cheers,applause) -- and Barney Frank and Chris Dodd told banks they have togive loans to people who couldn't afford to pay them back. And so -- and so our friends -- our friends in Washington today, they say, oh,if we've got a problem in the housing, let's let government play abigger role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the wrong way to go. Let markets work. Help people getback to work. Let them buy homes. You'll see home prices come backup if we allow this market to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LIESMAN: But Governor Perry, every quarter I get the report,the GDP figures, and it's a negative number for housing. And we'velost some 2 million construction jobs. Housing creates jobs as well;doesn't it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: Not a negative number in Texas, and one of thereasons is because we have put policies into place that follow my planto get America back working again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LIESMAN: OK, so translate that plan to America, please.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: When you look at what I've laid out, whether it'sthe energy side and getting the energy industry going -- and RickSantorum is absolutely correct on that, is let's get our energyindustry freed up, federal lands, federal waters -- pull back all ofthose regulations. Everybody on this stage understands, it's theregulatory world that is killing America. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax side of it, yeah, have a flat tax. Have a corporate flattax in there, as well. But the real issue facing America areregulations. It doesn't make any difference whether it's the EPA orwhether it's the federal banking, the Dodd-Frank or ''Obamacare,''that's what's killing America. And the next president of the UnitedStates has to have the courage to go forward, pull back everyregulation since 2008, audit them for one thing: Is it creating jobs,or is it killing jobs? And if that regulation is killing jobs, doaway with it. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Well, Congresswoman Bachmann, in one of the lastdebates you were asked what you would do about foreclosures, and youtold moms to hang on. But your advice, as your colleagues havementioned, was: Let the economy recover. So you agree with GovernorRomney that the way to fix the housing market is to let theforeclosure process proceed more rapidly?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. BACHMANN: Well, what I agree with is that we have got tostop what we're doing now. When we had the financial meltdown, 50percent of the homes were being financed by Fannie and Freddie; today,it's 90 percent of the homes. In other words, the government is thebacker of the homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, let's take a look and an analysis of what a great,brilliant job Freddie and Fannie are doing. They just applied thisweek for another $7 billion bailout because they're failing. Theother one applied for a $6 billion bailout because they're failing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what did they do? They just gave bonuses of almost $13million to 10 top executives. This is the epicenter of capital crony -- crony capitalism. That's what's wrong with Washington, D.C. Forthese geniuses to give 10 of their top executives bonuses at $12million, and then have the guts to come to the American people andsay, give us another 13 billion (dollars) to bail us out just for thequarter? That's lunacy. We need to put them back into bankruptcy -- (applause) -- and get them out of business. They're destroying thehousing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Since you mentioned Fannie and Freddie, SpeakerGingrich, 30 seconds to you. Your firm was paid $300,000 by FreddieMac in 2006. What did you do for that money?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: You -- were you asking me?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: I offered them advice on precisely what theydidn't do. (Laughter, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look, look, this is not -- this is --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Were you not trying to help <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> fend offthe effort by the Bush administration --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: No. No, I do no -- I have never done that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: -- to curb <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: I have never done -- I assume I get a secondquestion. I have never done any lobbying, every contract that waswritten during the period when I was out of the office specificallysaid I would do no lobbying, and I offered advice. And my advice as ahistorian, when they walked in and said to me, we are now making loansto people who have no credit history and have no record of paying backanything, but that's what the government wants us to do, is I said -- I said to them at the time: This is a bubble. This insane. This isimpossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turned out, unfortunately, I was right and the people who weredoing exactly what Congresswoman Bachmann talked about were wrong.And I think it's a good case for breaking up <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and FreddieMac and getting much smaller institutions back into the private sectorto be competitive and to be responsible for their behavior.(Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LIESMAN: Mr. Cain, government-sponsored entities Fannie Maeand <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, as Congresswoman Bachmann said, now underwrite orguarantee 90 percent of the home financing in this country. Whatwould you do with these -- with <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>? Would youshut them down even though it could mean higher interest rates forAmericans and make it even harder than it is right now for Americansto get home loans?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: You don't start there. You start with fixing the realproblem, which is growing this economy, which is why I have put a boldsolution on the table, 9-9-9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, then you get the regulators off of the backs of thebanks, like someone mentioned, get the regulars out of the way, suchthat the small banks and the medium-sized banks aren't being forcedout of the business. They would then be in a better position, andthey might develop a desire in order to help homeowners reset theirmortgages if they were able to see, number three, some certainty.Uncertainty is what's killing this economy, and until we throw out thetax code and put in something bold, get government out the way byreducing the regulatory environment, we are going to still have thehousing problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LIESMAN: I'm sorry, Mr. Cain, but you would come into officeand <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> would be there, and the question was,what would you do with them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: OK, after I did those three things that I outlined,then deal with <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LIESMAN: Right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: You don't start solving a problem right in the middleof it, so we got to do that first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would also turn those GSEs into private entities. Thegovernment does not need to be in that business. I would find a wayto unwind <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> such that the marketplace candetermine the future of the housing market. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Governor Huntsman, I want to go back to the issuethat you raised before about ''too big to fail.'' If anything, thatproblem has gotten worse since the financial crisis than before. The10 biggest bank holding companies in this country now hold nearly 90percent of all the assets in the banking system, up from 75 percent in2006. So what would you do? Would you break up the banks to removethe risk or diminish the risk for American taxpayers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HUNTSMAN: Let me just say on the housing discussion here,lost in all of this debate is the fact that there are people tuning intonight who are upside-down in terms of the financing of their homes,who are feeling real pain, people who probably heard today that theylost a job. These issues are very real. They're complicated. For usto say that there's an easy solution to housing, that's just notright. And that's not fair. The economy does have to recover inorder for the housing market to pick up its slack and for us to getonto housing starts, which ought to be 15 percent of our nation's GDP,and today it's 2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With respect to the banks that are too big to fail, you know,today we've got, as I mentioned earlier, six institutions that areequal to 60 (percent), 65 percent of our GDP, $9.4 trillion. Theyhave an implied guarantee by the taxpayers that they'll be protected.That's not fair. That's not right for the taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: So you break them up?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HUNTSMAN: I say we need to -- we need to right-size them. Isay in the 1990s you had <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, for example, that was 1.1 -- that was -- that was $200 billion in size. By 2008 it had grown to$1.1 trillion in size. Was that good for the people of this country?Or were -- were we assuming -- (inaudible) -- process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Well, how would you accomplish that? How would youright-size?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HUNTSMAN: I think we ought to set up some sort of fund.Well, I think we ought to charge some sort of fee from the banks thatmitigates the risk that, otherwise, the taxpayers are carrying.There's got to be something that takes the risk from the taxpayers offthe table so that these institutions don't go forward with thisimplied assumption that we're going to bail them out at the end of theday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not right, and it's not fair for the taxpayers of this country.(Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Let's stay on regulation for a moment. You haveall said that you will repeal President Obama's health carelegislation. Down the line, 30 seconds: If you repeal ''Obamacare,''what's the answer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Huntsman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HUNTSMAN: I would sit down and I would meet with the 50governors of this country. And I'd say: I did health care reform inmy state. Took us three years to get it done. We delivered aninsurance connector that was not a costly mandate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can sit down with the 50 governors and you can address costcontainment. This is a $3 trillion industry, half of which any expertwill tell you is totally nonsense and superfluous spending. How doyou get cost out of the system? How do you empower patients to betterunderstand what they're getting when they go into the doctor's office?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Number two, we need to do a better job in harmonizing medicalrecords so that we can pull up on a consistent basis the mostefficacious course of treatment for patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And third, we need to close the gap on the uninsured without acostly mandate, letting the free market work in bringing peopletogether with truly affordable insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: That's time. We want to get each of yourcomments on what the plan is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Paul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. PAUL: We need to get the government out of the business.And we do need to have the right to opt out of ''Obamacare,'' but weought to have the right to opt out of everything. And the answer toit is turn it back over to the patient and the doctor relationshipwith medical savings accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I would say that we've had too much government. I've been inmedicine. It's gone downhill. Quality has gone down. Prices haveskyrocketed because of the inflation. So you need to get a marketforce in there. But medical savings accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this mess has been created -- it's a bipartisan mess, so it'sbeen there for a while. But what we need is the doctor-patientrelationship and medical savings accounts where you can deduct it fromyour taxes and get a major medical policy. Prices then would comedown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Thirty seconds. Governor Perry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: Obviously, on the Medicare side you have to have aninsurance type of a program where people have options, which givesthem a menu of options of which they can choose from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think you have to have the doctors and the hospitals and the otherhealth care providers being given incentives on health care ratherthan sick care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then on Medicaid, it's really pretty simple, just like Jonand Mitt both know. You send it back to the states and let the statesfigure out how to make Medicaid work -- (applause) -- because I'llguarantee you, we will do it safely, we will do it appropriately andwe will save a ton of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Mr. Cain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: The legislation has already been written: H.R. 3000.In the previous Congress, it was H.R. 3400. And what that does -- it's already been written. We didn't hear about it in the previous -- the previous Congress, because ''Princess Nancy'' sent it to committeeand it stayed there -- (laughter) -- it never came out. H.R. 30 -- H.R. 3000 allows the decisions to be with the doctors and thepatients, not with the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. Thelegislation has already been written. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Governor Romney?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: Health care in 30 seconds -- it's a little tough,but let me try. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Number one, you return to the states the responsibility forcaring for their own uninsured, and you send the Medicaid money backto the states so they can craft their own programs. That's numberone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Number two, you let individuals purchase their own insurance -- not just getting it through their company, but buy it on their own ifthey want to -- and no longer discriminate against individuals whowant to buy their insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Number three, you do exactly what Ron Paul said. I don't alwayssay that, but I'm going to say it right now. (Laughter.) And thatis, you have to get health care to start working more like a market.And for that to happen, people have to have a stake in what the cost,and the quality as well, is of their health care. And so a healthsavings account or something called co-insurance, that's the way tohelp that and make that happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And finally, our malpractice system in this country is nuts.We've got to take that over and make sure we don't burden our systemwith that. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: Well, I just want to point out, my colleagues havedone a terrific job of answering an absurd question. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To say, in 30 seconds --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: You have said you want to repeal ''Obamacare,''correct?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: I'd like to -- let me just finish, if I may -- (inaudible, applause) -- to say in 30 seconds what you would do with18 percent of the economy, life and death for the American people, atopic I've worked on since 1974, about which I wrote a book called''Saving Lives and Saving Money'' in 2002, and for which I founded theCenter for Health Transformation, is the perfect case of why I'm goingto challenge the president to seven Lincoln-Douglas style three-hourdebates with a timekeeper and no moderator, at least two of whichought to be on health care, so you could have a serious discussionover a several-hour period that affects the lives of every person inthis country. (Cheers, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Would you like to try to explain -- would youlike to -- (cheers, applause) -- would you like to try to explain, insimple speak, to the American people, what you would do after yourepeal the president's health care legislation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: In 30 seconds? (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Take the time you need, sir. Take the time youneed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: I can't take what I need; these guys'll all gangup on me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: You want to answer the question tonight on healthcare, or no, Speaker?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: (Inaudible) -- something like -- (inaudible).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: You want to try to answer the question tonight,Speaker?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: No, let me -- let me just say it very straight.One, you go back to a doctor-patient relationship and you involve thefamily in those periods where the patient by themselves can't make keydecisions. But you relocalize it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two, as several people said, including Governor Perry, you putMedicaid back at the state level and allow the states to reallyexperiment, because it's clear we don't know what we're doingnationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three, you focus very intensely on a brand-new program on brainscience, because the fact is, the largest single (out-year ?) set ofcosts we're faced with are Alzheimer's, autism, Parkinson's, mentalhealth and things which come directly from the brain. And I am forfixing our health rather than fixing our health bureaucracy, becausethe iron lung is the perfect model of saving people so you don't needto pay for a federal program of iron lung centers because the poliovaccine eliminated the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a very short pracis. (Cheers, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Congresswoman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. BACHMANN: The main problem with health care in the UnitedStates today is the issue of cost. It's just too expensive. AndPresident Obama said that's what he would solve in ''Obamacare.'' We'dall save $2,500 a year in our premiums. Well, we have ''Obamacare,''but we didn't have the savings. So what I would do to replace it isto allow every American to buy any health insurance policy they wantanywhere in the United States without any federal minimum mandate.Today there is an insurance monopoly in every state in the country. Iwould end that monopoly and let any American go anywhere they want.That's the free market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Number two, I would allow every American to pay for thatinsurance policy, their deductibles, their copay, theirpharmaceuticals, whatever it is that's medical-related with their owntax-free money. And then finally, I'd have true medical malpracticeliability reform. If you do that, it's very simple. People own theirown insurance policies, and you drive the cost down, because what wehave to get rid of is government bureaucracy in health care. That'sall we bought in ''Obamacare'' was a huge bureaucracy. That has to goaway. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Senator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SANTORUM: This is, I think, the difference between me and alot of the candidates. I heard a lot of responses, but I hadn't -- Ihaven't seen a lot of consistency in some of the -- some of thoseresponses on the last few questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to health care, back in 1992 I introduced the firsthealth savings account bill that everybody up here said was the basisfor consumer-driven health care. I was leading on that before anyoneelse was even talking about it. Secondly, I was someone who proposeda block grant for Medicaid way back in 1998 with Phil Gramm, againleading on this issue. Same thing reforming the Medicare program backin the 1990s. Again, I led on these issues. I was always for havingthe government out of the health care business and for a bottom-up,consumer-driven health care, which is different than Governor Romneyand some of the other people on this panel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Number two -- and -- and I didn't get a chance to answer the -- any of the housing questions. I was on the bank and the housingcommittee when -- in -- in the United States Senate. I was one of 24people who wrote a letter to Harry Reid saying: Please let us bringup this housing legislation, which I voted for in the committee, thatwould have put curbs on Fannie and Freddie. I -- I -- I was out therebefore this bubble burst, saying this was a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I -- I was in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the other day and I had oneof a -- a home builder. He was the head of the association, came upto me and said: Rick, I'm here to apologize. We came here to pushyou so you would oppose, you know, putting caps on Fannie and Freddie.You were right. We were wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time and time again, Wall Street -- the Wall Street bailout -- five of the eight people on this panel supported the Wall Streetbailout. I didn't. I know that we solve problems best from thebottom up, not the top down and government intervention in themarketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Governor Romney, you have 30 seconds to respond.(Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: That's -- that's fine. I very -- believe verydeeply in the functioning of markets. The work I've done on healthcare -- I actually worked in -- as a consultant to the health careindustry, to hospitals and various health institutions. I had theoccasion of actually acquiring and trying to build health carebusinesses. I know something about it, and I believe markets work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what's wrong with our health care system in America is thatgovernment is playing too heavy a role. We need to get our markets towork by having the consumer, the patient, have a stake in what thecost and quality is of health care, give them the transparency theyneed to know where the opportunities are for lower cost and betterquality, to make sure that the providers offer them the broadest arrayof options that they could have. And once we have that happening,you'll see us -- we -- 18 percent of our GDP is spent on health care.The next highest nation in the world is 12 percent. It's a hugedifference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Time --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: We have to get the market to work to make sure thatwe get the kind of quality and value that America deserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: But Governor, let me ask you about health care,because Congressman Paul said put it back to the doctor and thepatient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You said a few moments ago that you thought that states should havethe responsibility for insuring the uninsured. Of course, inMassachusetts you enacted an individual mandate and subsidies to havepeople who didn't have insurance get it. So you think there's apretty large role for government in this area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: Well, I think the people have a responsibility toreceive their own care. Doctor-patient relationship is, of course --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: The government (has ?) responsibility to force it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: I didn't know whether Ron Paul was saying he's goingto get rid of Medicaid. I would not get rid of Medicaid. It's ahealth program for the poor. What I said was I would take theMedicaid dollars that are currently spent by the federal government,return them to the states so that states can craft their own programsto care for their own poor rather than having the federal governmentmandate a one-size-fits-all plan in the entire nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obamacare'' is wrong. I'll repeal it. I'll get it done.(Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. PAUL: John.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Congressman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. PAUL: My plan of cutting the budget by a trillion dollarsdoes deal with Medicaid, and that is that it preserves it and there isa transition period, with the goal that eventually we would hope tomove that back into the economy. But right now it would be too muchto do it in one year. You know, finding a trillion dollars was a joband a half, and -- (inaudible) -- department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, yes, my budget takes into consideration health care for theelderly, health care on Medicaid, as well as child health care. Atthe same time, we deal with the bailouts, the banks and all thebenefits that they get from the financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because what we're facing today is a crisis -- on this housingcrisis, if I could just have one second on that. We face the housingcrisis once again because it's price fixing. They're fixing theprices of these mortgages too high, and this is why nobody will buythem. This is why you have to get rid of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>,sell all of that into the marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the reason they do this is to prop up the banks, because thebanks have invested in Europe, they've invested in <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> andFreddie Mac and these credit default swaps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're in big trouble, and that is why they're getting bailed out,and that's why they're not allowing these mortgages to go down. Andthat is why we will most likely bail out Europe, which will be a realtragedy. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Congressman, it's -- thank you for that. It's timefor a quick break --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LIESMAN: Hold it. John, I wanted to give them 15 secondseach to solve the deficit problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: (Laughs.) We'll come back to the deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: When we return, balancing the budget and cuttingthe deficit, making the college education more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Plus, a little lesson on Social Security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You're watching CNBC's ''Your Money, Your Vote'' Republicanpresidential debate. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Announcements.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: And welcome back. Joining us for this portion ofthe debate, Rick Santelli, CNBC's on-air editor -- (cheers, applause) -- and Sharon Epperson, our personal finance correspondent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, we'll get to them in a moment, but first, Senator Santorum,you were known as a tough partisan fighter in the Senate. But lookwhere partisan fighting got us this summer: gridlock and a debtrating downgrade. The American people don't much like it, and neitherdoes Doug Oberhelman, the CEO of Caterpillar. Let's take a listen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DOUGLAS OBERHELMAN (CEO, <span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>.): (From video.) Mostpeople think our politicians are not helping the country get back onits feet. The last two presidents made promises to work across partylines, and both failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How will you put our country ahead of your political party andsolve the issues that are so critical for Americans? Be specific,please -- these are promises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: And Senator, let me ask you about -- to set up thatquestion. If everyone on this stage rules out any tax increases, evenat a 10-to-1 ration of spending cuts, as you have done, what could youpossibly offer Democrats to get them to go along and compromise withyou on the things that Republicans want?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SANTORUM: You create a -- you create a platform that theycan buy into, because they see the advantages of your -- of your plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, one of the reasons that I -- I put forward thismanufacturing plan is because folks here in Michigan, Democrats andRepublicans, will vote for it. I was at the New Hampshire House ofRepresentatives the other day and spoke to a bipartisan group, talkedabout the tax plan -- not just the manufacturing, but the broad-basedplan that I have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I had two Democratic house members go over to my chairman,Dan Tamburello, and said, hey, I want him to come to my district andtalk about this. We can support it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when you put together a plan -- look, if the RepublicanParty's just about keeping the top rate, you know, lower or cuttingtaxes, we're not going to be reaching people. We've got to look atplans that bring people together. That's why I've focused on thissector. I understand, John, that the Wall Street Journal won't likethat I'm picking one sector over another. I don't care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I need to do is bring America together, find a plan that canwork, that we -- can be implemented right away. It may not be theboldest plan in the world, but it's one that will work. It'll putpeople back to work. It'll give the ability to people to rise in oursociety. It'll help with the jobs out in rural America where themanufacturing loss has been the greatest and the employment (sic) rateis the highest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You put a plan like that together, you'll get Democrats andRepublicans, and we'll create jobs in this country. We'll get thingsdone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Governor Romney, you've shown that you can workwith Democrats. When you were governor, of course, you collaboratedwith Ted Kennedy on the health care plan that you enacted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You raised fees to balance the budget and you used that as an argumentto get the credit rating of your state upgraded. Independent votersmight like that. Should Republican primary voters be nervous aboutit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: Thanks for reminding everybody. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I've found is, in a state like mine where there are a fewDemocrats in the legislature -- 85 percent of my legislature wasDemocrat. To get anything done, I was always in an ''away'' game, ifyou will. And to get something done, I had to see if there wereDemocrats who cared more about the state than they cared about theirreelection or their party. And there were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And right now, America faces a crisis. I think people on bothsides of the aisle recognize that this is no longer a time just forworrying about the next election. This is a time to worry aboutAmerica.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We see what's happening in Italy, what's happening in Greece.That's where we're headed if we don't change our course. And thereare enough good Democrats and good Republicans willing to put asidepartisanship and do what's right for the country, in my view, ifthey're led by someone who cares more about the country, cares moreabout the future of America, cares about our kids and our grandkids,and is willing to step forward and lead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we have now is a president who, unfortunately, is driven byone thing: his reelection. It's unbelievable that we have the crisisgoing on in America that we have -- (applause) -- and we have apresident who is focused on trying to get himself reelected. This isa -- this is a crisis in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Time, Governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governor Perry, you play only home games in Texas. Do you givehim points for winning on the road?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: Listen, there is a reason that Caterpillar movedtheir hydraulics manufacturing and their engine manufacturing to thestate of Texas. It didn't have anything to do with Republican versusDemocrat. It had everything to do with creating a climate in ourstate where the job creators knew that they were going to have theopportunity to keep more of what they work for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: He's said he did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: And that's what Americans are looking for.(Scattered applause.) They're looking for a tax plan that basicallysays you're going to be able to keep more of what you work for.They're looking for a regulatory climate that doesn't strangle thelife out of their businesses when they want to put those dollars outthere to create the wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what Americans are looking for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think we're getting all tangled up around an issue here aboutcan you work with Democrats or can you work with Republicans. Yeah,we can all do that. But the fact of the matter is, we better have aplan in place that Americans can get their hands around, and that'sthe reason my flat tax is the only one of all the folks -- these goodfolks on the stage. It balances the budget in 2020. It does thethings for the regulatory climate that has to happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I will tell you, it's three agencies of government, when Iget there, that are gone: Commerce, Education and the -- what's thethird one there -- let's see. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. PAUL: You need five.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: Oh, five. OK.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. PAUL: Make it five.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: OK. So Commerce, Education and -- the -- (pause) --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: EPA?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: EPA. There you go. (Laughter.) (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Let's go --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR: HARWOOD: Seriously? Is EPA the one you were talking about?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: No, sir. No, sir. We were talking about theagencies of government -- EPA needs to be rebuilt. There's no doubtabout that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: But you can't -- but you can't name the third one?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: The third agency of government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: I would do away with the Education, the Commerce and -- let's see -- I can't. The third one, I can't. Sorry. Oops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: What about the EPA and the new rules coming outof the EPA? Mr. Cain, right now there is a situation with the EPA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">getting aggressive, the National Labor Relations Board gettingaggressive, wanting to shut down a plant in South Carolina. Whatwould you tell <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> to do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: What about --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Should they shut down that plant in SouthCarolina unless they make it union?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: Absolutely not. (Cheers, applause.) That's what'swrong with government (tampering ?). Absolutely not. (Applause.)The government has no business trying to pick winners and losers, aswe have said, whether it's through the front door with legislation orthe back door through regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, if I may go back --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: What about manufacturing? Zero tax rate for onesector of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: Well, this is why my 9-9-9 plan -- (cheers, applause) -- makes every sector grow. How about helping everybody, not just onesector? And that's the power of my 9-9-9 plan. Number one, it'sbold. And yes, I'm the only one that's put a bold plan on the tableand not afraid to go out and defend it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as far as getting both sides of the aisle to work together -- if I may; I don't see that little yellow light yet -- (laughter) -- in terms of getting both sides to work together, it's called provide acompelling solution, and the American people, if they understand it,they will demand it. That's how you get both sides of the aisle towork together. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Rick Santelli.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RICK SANTELLI (On-air editor, CNBC): Speaker Gingrich, for thefirst time in its 75-year history, Social Security is going to be inthe red. According to the Washington Post on October 29th, 105billion (dollars) this year. The reason: Political parties -- bothsides -- at the end of last year agreed that they wanted a tax cut.And the area they cut were payroll taxes, the main funding for SocialSecurity. If we continue that -- and there seems to be some agreementon both sides of the aisle to extend that tax cut -- for 2011 and2012, the cumulative amount will be closer to 260 billion (dollars).Are all tax cuts created equal? Is this a tax cut that you wouldback?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: Well, I'm not prepared to raise taxes on workingAmericans in the middle of a recession that's this bad. (Applause.)But let -- but let me put Social Security in context. In 1968, inorder to fake a balanced budget, Lyndon Johnson brought SocialSecurity in the general budget. And ever since, politicians have hidbehind Social Security. Now it's going to become a disadvantage to doso.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think the first step is you take Social Security off thefederal budget. You don't try to solve the budget deficit problem onthe back of working Americans and retirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You deal with Social Security as a free-standing issue. And the factis, if you allow younger Americans to have the choice to go to aGalveston or -- or Chilean-style personal Social Security savingsaccount, the long-term effect on Social Security is scored by theSocial Security actuary as absolutely stabilizing the system andtaking care of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key is, there's 2 trillion (dollars), 400 billion dollars inSocial Security which -- be -- which should be off-budget, and nopresident of the United States should ever again say, because of somepolitical fight in Washington, I may not be able to send you yourcheck. That money is sitting there. That money's available. And thecountry ought to pay the debt it owes the people who put the money inthere. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Governor Romney, if I could follow up, SpeakerGingrich just said he's not prepared to raise taxes on the Americanpeople in the middle of a slow economy like this. That's what wouldhappen if the payroll tax cut is not extended. Does -- do you agreewith him? And would you also support, when it comes down to it, anextension of the payroll tax cut?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: I want to -- I don't want to -- I don't want toraise taxes on people in the middle of a recession. Of course not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: So you're for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: That's -- and that's one of the reasons why -- whywe fought so hard to make sure the Bush tax cuts weren't taken away by -- by President Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But look, this issue of deficits and spending -- it's not aboutjust dollars and cents. This is a moral issue. It's a moralimperative. We can't continue to pass on massive debts to the nextgeneration. We can't continue to put at risk the -- the greatestnation in the history of the earth because of the profligate spendingthat's going on in Washington, D.C. And --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: But to clarify, you agree with President Obama thepayroll tax cut should be extended?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: I want to -- I want to keep our taxes down. I don'twant to raise any taxes anywhere. Let me -- I'm not looking to raisetaxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I'm looking to do is to cut spending. And that's why thislast week I put out a plan that dramatically cuts spending inWashington, that gets us to a 20 percent cap and makes sure that wehave a balanced budget thereafter. And how do I do it? I have threemajor steps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Number one, cut programs. Get rid of programs we don't have tohave, like ''Obamacare.'' Take a lot of programs that we have at thestate level, number two -- excuse me, at the federal level -- and sendthem back to the states where they can be better run with less fraudand abuse. And number three, finally, bring some productivity andmanagement expertise to the federal government. I would cut theworkforce by 10 percent --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. : Good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: -- and I want to say one more, and that is this. Iwant to make sure we link the compensation of our federal bureaucratsto that which exists in the private sector. People who are publicservants shouldn't get more money than the taxpayers that they'reserving. (Cheers, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Does any candidate on this stage disagree -- doesany candidate disagree and oppose extension of the payroll tax cut?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. BACHMANN: Say that again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Does any candidate disagree with the speaker andGovernor Romney, and oppose the extension of the payroll tax cut?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. : Yeah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LIESMAN: Go ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: You oppose it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. BACHMANN: I do. I opposed it when it was first proposed,because I knew that it would blow a hole of $111 billion in the SocialSecurity trust fund. President Obama clearly did this for politicalreasons. That's why he did it. And so I had made that warning then,because we actually have already run Social Security in the red. Wearen't just about to; we already have -- six years ahead of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, consider the context. We have Baby Boomers in their peakearning years. This is when money should be flooding into the SocialSecurity trust fund. Instead, we're already in the red. When we talkthis evening about how much trouble we're in with spending, we're in atremendous amount of trouble with spending. Just consider, we pay alot of taxes in this country: 2.2 trillion (dollars) is what we sendin to Washington. The problem is, we spent at the government level3.7 trillion (dollars). You started out trying to cut --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Well -- out of time, Congresswoman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rick?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SANTELLI: Governor Huntsman, our federal government --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HUNTSMAN: Thank you. It was getting a little lonely overhere. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SANTELLI: Our federal government still owns 500 millionshares of GM stock; guarantees trillions -- trillions with a ''T'' -- dollars of mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are basically the lender doing 90 percent of all the mortgageorigination right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And you consider the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve haspurchased 2.62 trillion (dollars) -- again with a T -- of Treasurysecurities, agency securities and mortgage securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you were president, how would your administration and wouldyour administration reverse these obligations?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HUNTSMAN: I would clean up the balance sheet. And let metell you what I worry about as much as anything else. We talk aboutfailed leadership; we certainly have failed leadership. PresidentObama had three years to get this economy going and to move us towardan environment that speaks to job growth, and he's failed miserably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But along with that, we have a real trust crisis in this countrybetween the American people and our institutions of power: Congress,the executive branch, Wall Street as well. There's no trust. We'rerunning on empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when a democracy begins to run on empty because of governmentholdings and bailouts and being involved in ways that are absolutelyinappropriate based on constitutional government and where we shouldbe, that results in a diminution of trust by the American people.We've got to raise that trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let me just tell you what I think needs to be done in terms ofbringing our economy up. We've heard about all these great tax plans.I think I'm the only one on this stage who's actually delivered a flattax. And I did that as governor of my state. I put forward aproposal that I think is right for this country in getting it back onits feet. The Wall Street Journal has come out -- the most respectededitorial page economically maybe in the entire world -- has come outand endorsed my plan, said it's the very best of the bunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it very simply calls out, just as I did as governor -- so I'mnot sitting here talking about academic theory. I stand here as apractitioner; I've done it before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I want to phase out the loopholes and the deductions on the individualside, phase out corporate welfare and subsidies on the corporate side --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Sharon Epperson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HUNTSMAN: -- and lower the rates, make us more competitive.That's the kind of work that is realistic. It can get done inCongress and fire the engines of growth that are so desperately neededto boost trust in this country. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Sharon Epperson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARON EPPERSON (personal finance correspondent, CNBC): I wantto turn the attention to why we're here on this campus and what manystudents are very interested in, and that is the fact that,Congressman Paul, right now we are looking at student loan debt thatis near $1 trillion. Americans owe more on student loans right nowthan credit cards, and the average debt for a college senior right nowis over $25,000. It's obviously a very hot topic right here on thiscampus and with students across the country. Just listen to what theyhave to say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Video begins.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. : Tuition rates have increased roughly three times thatof inflation over the last three decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. : More students have to take out loans or forgo college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. : My generation is graduating with student debt levels atan unprecedented level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Video ends.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. EPPERSON: So Congressman Paul, you've already talked aboutthe fact that you want to get rid of the Department of Education.You've said that you want to get rid of federal student loans. So howwould you make college more accessible, more affordable for thesestudents and students around the country?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. PAUL: Well, I think you've proved that the policy ofstudent loans is a total failure. (Chuckles.) I mean, a trilliondollars of debt? (Cheers, applause.) And it's going to be dumped on</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">the taxpayer? And what have they gotten? A poorer education andcosts that have skyrocketed because of inflation. And they don't havejobs. There's nothing more dramatically failing than -- than thatprogram.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So no, there is no authority in the Constitution for the federalgovernment to be dealing with education. We should get rid of theloan programs. We should get rid of the Department of Education andgive tax credits, if you have to, to help people. But the inflationis the big problem. It's three times the rate that the governmentadmits that inflation is, and that is natural and normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When governments inflate the currency, it goes in the areas that thegovernment gets involved in. Housing, high -- (inaudible). Stockmarket, skyrocketing prices. Medical care, skyrocketing. Education --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. EPPERSON: But how will they pay for it? How do they now payfor college if they're not --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. PAUL: The way you pay for cell phones and computers.(Cheers, applause.) You have the marketplace there. There'scompetition. Quality goes up; the price goes down. Can you imaginewhat it would have been like if the Department of Homeland securitywas in charge of finding one person -- or one company to make the cellphones? I mean, it would have been a total disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when the government gets involved in the delivery of anyservice, whether it's education, medical care or housing, they causehigher prices, lower quality, create bubbles, and they get us thismess that we're in. That's why we have to eventually get -- we haveto wise up and look at where the bubbles come from. It's from theFederal Reserve. And we should start by auditing the Fed, and then weshould end the Fed. (Cheers, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. EPPERSON: Thank you, Congressman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaker Gingrich, Congressman Paul just talked about a bubble.And there are many that are concerned that unlike other types of debt,student loan debt does not have the same type of consumer protections.It cannot be wiped out in bankruptcy, by law. There's really littleway to refinance it. Are you worried about student loan debt becomingthe next government bailout?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: You know, this is a good place to talk about thescale of change we're about to live through. We're at the end of thewelfare-state era of dependency, debt, distortion and dishonesty. Thestudent loan program began -- when Lyndon Johnson announced it, Ithink it was a $15 million program. It's an absurdity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does it do? It expands the ability of students to stay incollege longer because they don't see the cost. It actually meansthey take fewer hours per semester, on average; it takes longer forthem to get through school; it allows them to tolerate tuitions goingup absurdly. By 2014, there will be one administrator for everyteacher on college campuses in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now let me give you a contrast that's very startling. TheCollege in (sic) the Ozarks is a work-study college. You cannot applyto it unless you need student aid, and they have no student aid. Youhave to work 20 hours a week during the year to pay tuition and books.You work 40 hours a week during the summer to pay for room and board.Ninety-two percent of the students graduate owing no debt. The 8percent who owe debt owe $5,000 because they bought a car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, that is a model so different it will be culture shock forthe students of America to learn we actually expect them to go toclass, study, get out quickly, charge as little as possible, andemerge debt-free by doing the right things for four years. (Cheers,applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Governor Perry -- Governor Perry, name the topprograms that you would cut in terms of long-term deficit reduction.Include Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and defense spending inthe order you see fit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: Well, every one of those -- and by the way, that wasthe Department of Energy I was reaching for a while ago. So -- (laughter, cheers, applause).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's what we have to look at as Americans, and it's theentitlement programs that are eating up this huge amount of moneythat's out there. And it's also the spending, Congressman Paul. Andthose -- when you look at Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, andthose unfunded liabilities I think are over $115 trillion just inthose three programs. Those are the places where you go where youhave to make the really hard decisions in this country. Those are the --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: So what is your order? And you didn't mentiondefense spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: Well, obviously Social Security is one of thosewhere we either can go to a blended type of a program where we blendprice and wages and come up with a program and can save billions ofdollars there. But the people who are on Social Security, they needto understand something today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's going to be there for them. Those that are working their waytowards Social Security, we've made a pledge to them that thoseindividuals are going to have those dollars there for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the young people out there -- who's going to stand up for theyoung people in this country, those that are at the workforce today,and stand up and say: We're going to transform this program so it'sgoing to be there for you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Well, Governor --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: I will do that. I will stand up for the youngpeople in this country and put a program into place that will be therefor them. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Speaking of young people, quick answer: Do youagree with Congressman Paul that we should kill the federal studentloan program?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: I happen to think there are a substantial number ofways -- matter of fact, I've called for a $10,000 (graduate ?) program --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: But would you kill the federal student loanprogram?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: I don't think the federal government should be inthe business of paying for programs and building up huge debt outthere. I think we need to look at how do you force these universities --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: So get rid of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: -- how do force these universities to be efficient?And one of the ways is that the governors who appoint the -- the -- the trustees -- they step in and they basically say: Listen, you aregoing to have graduation rates that are moving upwards. You're goingto have tuition that is moving down. You have to have control overthose boards of regents, if that's how you do it, or the legislaturehas to have control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the bottom line is, we have to put powerful economic forcesinto place. And one of those is using our technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Thank you, Governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: We're going to take one more quick break. Whenwe return: final questions to the candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Our CNBC Republican presidential debate will beright back. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Announcements.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Welcome back to CNBC's Republican presidentialdebate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Mr. Cain, I want to ask you a question. Under aRepublican governor, the state of California hired a company in Chinato build major portions of the new San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge;created thousands of jobs in China. And California did that becauseit was cheaper. Is that smart purchasing by government in a globaleconomy, or is there something wrong with that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: There's something wrong with that, which is why I haveproposed a bold plan -- (laughter) -- 9-9-9 -- and allow me to explainhow, under 9-9-9, that that company would be more inclined to keep thebusiness here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the first nine, you take sales minus purchases, net exportsand capital. It levels the playing field between goods produced herein the United States and the rest of the world. It makes the UnitedStates much more competitive, and businesses won't be tempted to buildoverseas, send jobs overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax code is what sends jobs overseas. The tax code is whatcaused them to buy those articles from the Chinese. It starts withreplacing the tax code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Governor Romney, was it a mistake for GovernorSchwarzenegger to hire the firm in China to build portions of thatbridge?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: Well, that's a -- a long answer to that because what -- what China is doing is not playing fairly by the -- the rules thatexist in our -- in the WTO and in the world. China is, on almostevery dimension, cheating. And we got to recognize that. (Applause.)It is good for America -- it -- it is good for America to have freetrade. It is good for us to be able to send our goods and servicesaround the world and vice versa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: So a good decision to build the bridge over the --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: That -- that is -- that is normally a good thing.But China is playing by different rules. One, they're stealingintellectual property. Number two, they're hacking into our computersystems, both government and corporate, and they're stealing by virtueof that as well from us. And finally, they're manipulating theircurrency and, by doing so, holding down the price of Chinese goods andmaking sure their products are artificially lowly -- low-priced. It'spredatory pricing. It's killing jobs in America. If I'm president ofthe United States, I'm making it very clear: I love free trade; Iwant to open markets to free trade, but I will crack down on cheaterslike China. They simply cannot continue to steal our jobs. (Cheers,applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: How do you crack down? How do you crack down,Governor? Are you -- are you talking about new tariffs? How are youcracking down?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: I'm sorry? Pardon?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: How would you crack down on China?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: Well, number one, I would do something thispresident should have done a long time ago, which is to label China acurrency manipulator. And then I'd bring an action at the WTO levelcharging them with being a -- a currency manipulator. Number three,where they have stolen intellectual property, where they have hackedinto computers and where their artificial pricing is causing theirgoods to have predatory levels of pricing, I would apply, ifnecessary, tariffs to make sure that they understand we're willing toplay on a level playing field. We want -- we have to have free trade.That's essential for the -- the -- the functioning of a strongeconomy. But we cannot allow one nation to continue to flaunt therules and kill our jobs by allowing them to continue as they have.(Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Speaker, in addition to that, so many companies -- multinational companies want to try to get a foothold in China andsell to the billion and a half people there. They can only do jointventures. They are not getting a fair shake in terms of selling tothat 1 1/2 billion-person population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How would you move the needle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GINGRICH: There are two things here, and let me say inadvance that I would yield in part to Governor Huntsman because hespeaks fluent Chinese, he's worked in China, and he's been theambassador. And I'd be curious to get his reaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are two different parts here. The problem withbuilding the bridge is simple. What is it about American regulations,American taxation, American labor costs and attitudes that makes itcheaper to go to China than to go to the United States? (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we do it -- (see ?), first of all, you've got to decide, howare we going to be more competitive and how are we going to be thelowest cost? And there's a -- there's a new Boston consulting studythat says by 2015 South Carolina and Alabama will be cheaper than theChinese coastal provinces to manufacture in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, in terms of dealing with China strategically, I thinkwe're going to have to find ways to dramatically raise the pain levelfor the Chinese cheating, both in the hacking side but also on thestealing and intellectual property side. And I don't think anybodytoday has a particularly good strategy for doing that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Time -- 30 seconds. Jon Huntsman, you were theambassador to China. 30 seconds to respond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HUNTSMAN: Thirty seconds! For heaven's sake. (Laughter.)Let me just say that we've had a 40-year relationship with China.It's a -- it's a troublesome and problematic relationship; very, verycomplicated. But the bottom line is -- I mean, you can give applauselines and you can kind of pander here and there. You start a tradewar if you start slapping tariffs randomly on Chinese products basedupon currency manipulation. I -- that's not a good idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But longer term, we're just going to have to do business the waywe've always done. You sit down, you find solutions to the problems,and you move forward. It isn't easy, it isn't glamorous. It'sgrinding it out the way we've done it for 40 years. And for 40 moreyears, we're going to have to do it the same way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Are you saying Governor Romney's pandering?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HUNTSMAN: I'm saying that you can throw out applause linesand you can say that you're going to slap on tariffs. You know, thatdoesn't work -- (inaudible) --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: But you're suggesting it. He's standing righthere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would you say that he's pandering on this issue?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HUNTSMAN: Well, I've said it before; I think that thatpolicy is one of simply pandering, just throwing a tariff on for thesake of an artificially valued currency, which is, in fact, the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here's what they do in response. They say: You have anartificially valued currency too, with those quantitative easingprograms, you too are manipulating your currency, and we're going toslap something on your products. And before long, you have a tradewar. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let me tell you --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Governor Romney, are you pandering?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ROMNEY: Look, I've been in business all my life, 25 years.I consulted to businesses around the world. I've been in businesswhere we competed around the world. I understand free trade. I likefree trade. I know that America can compete with anyone in the world.Newt is right about our capacity to manufacture and compete heads-onversus the Chinese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I've also seen predatory pricing. I've seen people pricetheir goods at an artificial level for an extended period of time suchthat they can drive other people out of business. And then when theother people are out of business, they can raise their prices. That'swhat China's doing by holding down the value of their currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let the currencies float. If the U.S. currency, for instance, isbeing inflated, let it float. Let us float. Let us have a marketmechanism determine the value of our respective currencies, as opposedto the Chinese government continuing to put an advantage there fortheir producers. This is no longer a time for us just to sit back andsay we're going to let them steal our jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Congresswoman Bachmann, weigh in here. How doyou open the markets in China for American companies?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. BACHMANN: Well, the Chinese have been bad actors. Recentlywe've found out that they've dumped counterfeit computer chips here inthe United States. We're using some of those counterfeit computerchips in the Pentagon in some of our weapon systems. This hasnational security implications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also found out that the Chinese just finished building 3,000miles of underground tunnels where they're housing some nuclearweapons. There's some very real consequences to the United Statesoverspending to such an extent that we're in hock to them over atrillion dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've sent so much interest money over to the Chinese to pay our debtsoff that we effectively built their aircraft carrier. And by 2015, wewill be sending so much interest money over, we will be paying for theentire People's Liberation Army of China, the number-one employer ofthe -- of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we need to do is stop enriching China with our money. Andwe do that by stop borrowing from them, by stop spending money that wedon't have. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CRAMER: Mr. Cain, I want to go to you with this question.This does not lend itself to 9-9-9 or any other number, OK?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the first part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CRAMER: This question does not lend itself to 9-9-9 or anyother (thing ?). This is our final word, OK? And it comes from ourviewers. And it is all about restoring trust and faith in our marketsand in our way of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm going to be quoting Joanne Kornbleat (ph). She emails us;she says: Our stock market has turned into a casino, with high-frequency computerized trading comprising 70 percent of alltransactions, and hedge-fund speculation resulting in volatile marketswings. Before privatizing Social Security, how would you make thestock market safer for individual investors?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. Cain -- just simple -- how do we restore faith in themarkets for the little guy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: The first thing we do is restore faith in business byproviding certainty so businesses can grow. A lot of the volatilityis being driven by uncertainty. Businesses are uncertain about whatthe health care rules are going to be. They don't know what the taxrules are going to be. All of the uncertainty has this economystagnated. So the way you restore that: Grow this economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's job one. Many of the things we talked about up here todaystarts with growing the economy. And that's why we've got to use abold plan -- I won't mention it -- (laughter) -- in order to grow theeconomy. (Laughter, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CRAMER: But when the economy was growing great, sir, therewas no trust. You know, when the economy going great, people weregetting ripped off, and there was insider trading. When the economywas going great, people were getting hurt in the stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: Jim --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CRAMER: Talk about the way the market's regulated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: Jim, Jim, Jim, I -- I feel your pain. Look, here'swhat I'm saying. Here's --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CRAMER: It (isn't a feeling ?). (How about ?) the 90million people who've got money in the market -- (inaudible)?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. CAIN: No, Jim, you got to provide certainty in the -- you -- in this environment, so businesses will grow. They have been in amode of survive. They need to be in a mode of grow. That's what wegot to do first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I agree with some of the others who said we got to repealDodd-Frank. There's three big things wrong with Dodd-Frank, which iswhy it needs to be a top priority to repeal. Number one, it doesn'tprovide oversight for <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, and we all agreedthat that was the catalyst for the meltdown in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two other biggest problems with Dodd-Frank: Dodd and Frank.(Laughter, cheers, applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: Governor Perry, Governor Perry, same question toyou -- same question to you and Congressman Ron Paul: How do yourestore faith in the public markets?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOV. PERRY: Well, we have the regulations in place and we hadthe regulations in place well before the meltdowns occurred. We havea culture in Washington, D.C., where these corporate lobbyists havethese cozy relationships with the people that they're regulating. And</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- and we have to have leadership in this country that not onlyrecognizes that but demands that those individuals who are working forus are in those agencies, whether it's in the stock market or whetherit's at -- at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, and when there areindividuals who are breaking the laws, who are pushing the bounds,that there are clear efforts that are made to take those people eitherout of those jobs or prosecute them for criminality, one of the two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has to happen. And then -- and you can pass legislation, likeyou said, until the world looks level. But you've got to have men andwomen who are committed to the laws of this country and a presidentthat will push his administration to make sure that they're done.(Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HARWOOD: Congressman Paul, Governor Perry was just talkingabout the culture of Washington. His critics in the state of Texas -- you're a congressman from Texas -- say crony capitalism is what he'spracticed as governor. Are they right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REP. PAUL: I haven't analyzed it well enough to call him a cronyor not. So no, I -- I -- I -- I don't know the details of that. Butthere is a lot of crony capitalism going on in this country. And thathas to be distinguished from real capitalism because that's -- thisoccupation stuff on Wall Street -- if you're -- if you're going aftercrony capitalism, I'm all for it. And those are the people whobenefit from contracts from government, benefits from the FederalReserve, benefits from all the bailouts. They don't deservecompassion. They deserve taxation, or they don't -- they deserve tohave all their benefits removed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But crony capitalism isn't when somebody makes money and theyproduce a product. That is very important. We have to distinguishthe two. And unfortunately, I think some people mix that. But this,to me, is so vital that we recognize what crony -- what capitalism isversus crony capitalism. And believe me, when you have aninflationary environment and all this speculation and all thatbailouts do to the monetary system, believe me, you'd get a majorityof them (to ?) crony capitalism. And that's why we're facing thiscrisis today. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. BARTIROMO: We want to thank all of you tonight. That is allthe time we have for CNBC's Republican presidential debate. We thankall of the candidates for being here tonight and spending the time andputting their plans forward.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF you ask most people about the possibility of reducing or eliminating the tax deduction for interest on home mortgages, you will generally hear the same things that you would if you suggested altering Social Security benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's political suicide. It will crush an already anemic economy. It's downright un-American.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk to most economists, though, and they are likely to question the rationale of having a tax deduction at all. They will tell you that countries like Australia, Canada and Britain do not have a deduction for mortgage interest, yet have higher rates of homeownership than the United States. And they will ask, what behavior is the United States government trying to encourage by favoring homeowners over renters?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeownership would be the obvious answer, but it is an incomplete one. ''Its intention was to increase the rate of homeownership,'' said Celia Chen, a senior director and housing economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. ''It hasn't helped to expand homeownership, but it's helped to support purchases of larger homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many lower-income homeowners do not itemize their tax returns, because they do not have enough deductions to make it worthwhile. In filing the basic 1040 form, they do not benefit from the deduction. Many older Americans -- perhaps as few as 10 percent, according to one study -- do not benefit from it either, because they have paid off their mortgages entirely or rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deduction overwhelmingly favors wealthier homeowners. The limits are quite high -- up to $1 million of a mortgage's value and an additional $100,000 for home equity loans -- and the amount that can be deducted does not fall as people's incomes rise. And the deduction is not limited to a primary residence, so someone with two or three homes that fall under that $1 million limit could claim the deduction. Even so, it is one of the few benefits for the wealthy that seems not to have been swept up in the recent tax-the-rich movements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Surveys that ask people if they're supportive of it get very broad-based support, because renters aspire to be homeowners,'' said Eric Belsky, managing director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard. ''The idea that it won't be available to them when it was available to others doesn't seem fair.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New York Times/CBS News poll in June found that 9 in 10 Americans thought homeownership was an important part of the American dream, while 45 percent of respondents felt that the government should be doing more to help the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it tenable to maintain the mortgage interest deduction? Here is a look at the state of the deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ITS FUTURE The deduction began when the federal tax code was created in 1913. At the time, all interest was deductible because the government considered it a business expense. The mortgage interest deduction survived the overhaul of the tax code in 1986 when interest on credit cards, which had also been deductible, was eliminated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one I spoke to was willing to wager that the mortgage interest deduction would go away. That was one proposal in the report released by Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, who headed a bipartisan panel created at the behest of President Obama to find solutions to the fiscal problems the United States faces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Simpson-Bowles report also offered a second idea: reduce the limit on the deduction to $500,000 of a mortgage's value from $1 million, eliminate the deduction for home equity loans and prohibit people from deducting the interest on a second home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Pozen, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and the former chairman of <span class="companylink">MFS Investment Management</span>, said that approach was a logical way to reduce the cost of the deduction without discouraging people from buying homes. ''These three aspects have a weak relationship at best to promoting homeownership,'' he said. ''How is this goal furthered by the mortgage interest deduction for a second home in the mountains?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He calculated that taking those three steps would save the government $150 billion over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate lobby objects strongly to any change in the current limits, even for second homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our members believe tinkering with the mortgage interest deduction at the high end will trickle down,'' said Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. He argued that with a reduction at the top level, prices on more expensive homes would fall, but so too would prices on less expensive homes as certain buyers realized they could not afford as much house without the deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People view this as part of the social contract, as something that represents the American dream,'' Mr. Yun said. ''Therefore any changes are changes to the property rights of homeowners.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COST In addition to being one of the oldest federal tax deductions, the mortgage interest deduction is the largest one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it cost $90 billion last year and would cost $484 billion from 2010 to 2014. Depending on your point of view, this is either a very large revenue loss to the federal government or a very large saving for homeowning taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a quarter of all tax filers claim the deduction, said Mr. Belsky at Harvard. But a look at some other numbers shows how the deduction affects Americans disproportionately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sid Rosenberg, the William F. Sheffield Professor of Real Estate at the University of North Florida, calculated that the deduction would mean little to a person buying or selling a house in Florida, where the median price is $135,000. He estimated interest deductions of $7,000, which is below the standard deduction of $11,600 that a couple get if they do not itemize all of their deductions on their tax return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To me it's a heck of a lot more valuable to people in New York than people in Florida,'' he said. ''If you're moderate income and you're in Florida, you're probably not going to get much effective deduction. It's certainly not the case that not having it is going to hurt poor people, at least not down here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it does have an impact in states where income and housing prices are higher. Melissa Labant, technical manager at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, calculated two situations for middle- and upper-income homeowners in more expensive states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first situation, consider a couple who earn $137,300 a year and are in the 25 percent tax bracket. If they owned a $350,000 house paying 5 percent interest on their mortgage, they would save $4,375 a year on interest of about $17,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the wealthiest homeowners the deduction is far better. People with $1 million homes with the same 5 percent rate would be paying $50,000 a year in interest. As they would most likely be in the top 35 percent tax bracket, they would save $17,500 a year in federal taxes through the deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problem is, everyone's information is different, and that's what makes it so challenging,'' Ms. Labant said. ''High-income taxpayers have benefited the most from being able to take advantage of the mortgage interest deduction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That should not be surprising -- bigger mortgages equate to more interest and bigger deductions. But it does contradict the belief that the deduction helps lower-income people buy their first homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IMPACT ON HOUSING The big question is what effect changing the mortgage interest deduction would have on the housing market. In the short term, it would be bad, and given the weak housing market, it could be worse than at some other time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A change to the deduction would hurt people who already own homes more than new buyers, in two ways. If homeowners wanted to sell, they would, on average, get less for their house. That's because the prospective buyers would have to recalculate what they could afford to pay each month toward their mortgage -- and thus the purchase price -- if the deduction disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The price of the deduction is built into the home, so eliminating it would have a negative impact in the near term,'' said Ms. Chen of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. ''If you reduced the limit of the deduction, it would hit higher-end housing, but the impact on lower-income households isn't that great.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time and lower-income buyers might get a break, however, because housing prices would be lower. Ms. Chen said the absence of a deduction was not likely to affect the number of homes sold at the high end because wealthier buyers would most likely still want to own a nice home (though it might affect the price, at least in the short term).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where eliminating the deduction would have an impact would be on people who itemized their taxes and took the deduction. Mr. Belsky estimated that eliminating the deduction would increase their taxes, on average, about $2,400 a year. And in the broader economy, that means less demand for goods and services from spenders and less money for savers to use to buy stocks and bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately a reduction of the deduction would not quash the American dream of homeownership and, if modified, it might help certain buyers get their first homes. But it is impossible to predict what might happen given the current political stalemate. Besides, most of the conversation in Washington is about revenue, not about the harder philosophical question of what the deduction is meant to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We as a country should decide what types of homeowners we want to subsidize and how,'' Mr. Pozen said. ''At present, we have a vaguely defined policy goal together with programs that are not well designed to accomplish that goal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHARTS: What the Mortgage Interest Deduction Is Worth: Here's what a married couple, filing their taxes jointly, would save each year in federal income taxes depending on how much they earn, the size of their mortgage and the interest rate they are paying on a 30-year interest-only loan. The analysis uses interest-only loans to keep the principal and interest consistent through the year; it assumes no other itemized deductions for things like state income taxes, real estate taxes or charitable contributions.; Annual federal tax savings from the mortgage interest deduction (Source: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIKE many young married people, Steve and Logan Kinney dream of owning a home. So after several years of diligent saving, the couple, both teachers, scoured the listings in Boerum Hill, the leafy Brooklyn neighborhood where they rented. But before long, they realized that home ownership would require living within the four walls of a studio. And even that was a stretch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From what I've been told from TV, you are supposed to get a house,'' said Mr. Kinney, 27, referring to the progression of life after marriage. ''And then I get to sit in a nice chair.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they kept a sense of humor and broadened their search to seemingly more affordable areas: Jersey City, the Rockaways in Queens and neighborhoods farther out in Brooklyn. Their jobs at opposite ends of the city -- she teaches first graders in Harlem, while he works in Rockaway Park -- further complicated their search. But the real challenge was their price range: with a budget of only $250,000, their quest was over shortly after it began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considering the city where they live, the Kinneys' predicament is not unusual. Yes, prices have tumbled 32 percent from their peaks, according to Fiserv Case-Shiller, and housing is now more affordable across the nation. But the couple lives in one of those places where the crash seemed to play out only on the nightly news. Here, gravity-defying ZIP codes rule the land, pushing home ownership out of reach for everyone but the most affluent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, prices in several metropolitan areas -- including New York, Los Angeles and Boston -- will end up being higher than their prebubble levels, at least relative to local income, said David Stiff, an economist at Fiserv Case-Shiller, which tracks the real estate market. There are a few reasons, but one of the main drivers is the work force: these areas develop pools of specialized, highly compensated employees. Think of Silicon Valley in Northern California, the financial industry in New York or the biotechnology sector in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When that industry booms, it drives up home prices for everyone,'' Mr. Stiff said. ''Through each boom cycle, the price levels relative to income at the end of the cycle will be higher than at the beginning, so you get a ratcheting effect of unaffordability.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even though lower- and middle-income households are not directly competing with the wealthier workers for housing, they are still affected. ''Each step of the way they are pushing prices up out to my market,'' he added. ''So in many instances, the only option is an extremely long commute.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When prices peaked, the median cost nationwide of a single-family home was $226,000, four times the median income. Since then prices have dropped to levels last seen in the mid-'90s: at $166,000, that's about 2.7 times the median income of $61,593, according to Fiserv.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But things begin to look a lot less affordable when you consider hot spots like Los Angeles. The median home there costs about 5.86 times the median income, compared with 4.89 in San Francisco. New York isn't far behind: the median home runs about 4.62 times the median income, in part because of foreign buyers who take advantage of a weaker dollar. In Boston, it costs 3.7 times median income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many would-be buyers, that means it is simply more affordable to rent. But that can be frustrating for people who thought they had done everything right, except for choosing a higher-paying profession. The Kinneys both went to Rutgers, a public university in their home state, to keep student debts manageable. Instead of attending graduate programs at costly private schools, they became New York City Teaching Fellows, an intensive teacher-training program that subsidizes the cost of a master's degree in education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they moved in together, the couple began saving about $700 each month, and Mr. Kinney helped his future wife extinguish the credit card loans she had accumulated in school. Their wedding, two years ago, was a small affair in Ms. Kinney's mother's backyard in New Jersey, where Mr. Kinney's father served as the photographer. They honeymooned in Paris, but did it on a student's budget, staying in hostels and subsisting on baguettes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, they have no debt other than Ms. Kinney's student loans, which total about $25,000 -- not too bad, relative to many of her peers. They've been saving about $1,000 most months and put an additional 15 percent away for retirement. They both have credit scores that top the enviable 800 mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why can't their savings yield enough money for a hefty down payment? ''It feels like anytime we hit around $20,000 something terrible or some unexpected thing happens,'' Mr. Kinney said of their savings which reached about $22,000 at its peak. He planned on coming up with another $20,000 for their down payment by borrowing from his pension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that still wasn't enough to stretch their price range much further. Since then, their savings has dwindled a bit, largely because so many things need to go right for it to grow. About a year and a half ago, Ms. Kinney was working as a special education teacher through an agency, but her small caseload and collection of part-time jobs didn't generate enough income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kinney recently returned to graduate school, because more credits will lead to a higher paycheck, while Ms. Kinney spent about $2,500 getting certified in yoga instruction so she can teach during the summers. Their quest to find a cheaper rental also cost them thousands in brokers fees each time they moved. Then there's the $800 they had to spend on shots for Marley and Bucu, their dog and cat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unless you are a lawyer, owning a home is out of the question,'' said Mr. Kinney, adding that they would need to save the equivalent of one year's salary, before taxes, to come up with the full 20 percent down payment needed to avoid private mortgageinsurance. ''That's a lot of money and assumes nothing ever comes up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that doesn't even include the $10,000 cushion they would like to keep in the bank -- after the down payment and closing costs -- which would make them comfortable buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saving that much has always been a slog, which is why experts say that first-time home buyers rarely come up with the full 20 percent down payment. In fact, more than 53 percent of first-time home buyers obtain mortgages through the Federal Housing Administration's program, where government-insured loans permit borrowers to put as little as 3.5 percent down, according to a September survey of 2,500 real estate brokers conducted by Inside Mortgage Finance and Campbell Surveys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only about 11.2 percent of first-time home buyers took traditional mortgages that are backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. The remainder paid with cash, private financing, or through programs sponsored by the Veterans Affairs or Agriculture Departments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kinneys were considering an F.H.A. mortgage, but for now, they're back to watching their spending. They rarely eat out, though they do splurge on organic produce. Mr. Kinney said he could draw a map of the city's best happy hours, which ''dovetails nicely with the fact that we're public school teachers and have been up since 5 a.m.''; they are ready for bed soon after the specials are over. He has worn the same $20 sneakers for two years. They reward themselves with one vacation a year, which is typically financed with half of their tax refund. The other half is saved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple said they were grateful for what they have. Still, the inability to buy makes them feel as if they are living an extended adolescence, especially because they're eager to start a family. ''There is something about that that makes you feel like you are not fully a member of society,'' Mr. Kinney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You still feel like a child,'' Ms. Kinney added, conceding that sometimes she feels that the goal is so far off that it's not even worth trying. But during those moments, Mr. Kinney, the money manager, tries to keep them focused (just don't tell him it's a great time to buy). The couple might also move West at some point, but not until the economy improves. And right now, they love living in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, they have managed to find a two-bedroom rental that feels more like home, a few blocks from the sand and surf in the Rockaway Beach section of Queens. At $1,600, it costs the same as the dark basement studio they had rented in Brooklyn. ''Rockaway Beach is a little far out there,'' Ms. Kinney said of her three-hour round-trip commute, ''but whenever I come home I will have the ocean at my door.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that doesn't cost their down payment fund anything at all.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FAIGIE RICHMAN used to tell everyone that she never wanted to live in Florida. She enjoyed visiting her husband's family in Boca Raton, but the lifestyle simply did not suit her. She didn't play golf or tennis and had no desire to learn either. And she and her husband already owned a second home, on a pond in Rhode Island, that their three children loved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So she was just as surprised as anyone when she and her husband ended up with two condominiums in Miami Beach, 50 miles south of Boca Raton, this spring. They had gone to Miami Beach to look at a condo for their daughter and report back. Instead, they closed on that one and another in the building in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not the type of people who do things spontaneously,'' she said. ''We thought it was a good opportunity to get in at the ground floor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting in their uncluttered one-bedroom condo, with Biscayne Bay stretching out before her, Mrs. Richman, 56, said she and her husband felt like newlyweds again. And their apartment, built many booms and busts ago in 1962, is indeed very new to them. When Mrs. Richman was interviewed, the couple had lived in the condo for only six weeks, three in the spring when they bought it and three after arriving for the season at the beginning of October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although they have been struggling to find a buyer for their primary residence in West Hartford, Conn., Mrs. Richman said she was relishing having less stuff and more things to do when her husband travels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this she sounds no different from the snowbirds of the decades before her, lured to Florida by the promise of sun, fun and far fewer responsibilities. Yet the purchases were not some flight of fancy -- and plenty of other people are shopping opportunistically just as the Richmans did. The combination of low prices for vacation properties, the volatility in the stock and bond markets and the American love of property is proving too tempting for people seeking second homes in desirable locales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Miami, just a few years ago a symbol of the excesses of the real estate boom. Sales in Miami were up 34.1 percent in September from the same month last year, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in other hard-hit areas also rose. Atlanta was up 24.7 percent and Phoenix was up 25.3 percent in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a separate report by the Miami Association of Realtors released last month, sales in Miami were on pace to hit 29,000 this year, higher than the record set in 2005. That said, prices are nowhere near what they were in those frothier days. While condo prices rose 17 percent in September, they were coming off a very low base; prices for single-family homes continued to fall, down 6 percent to $131,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Richmans see the two condos as investments. They paid cash for them, just as they would have if they had made investments in a brokerage account. (The Miami Association of Realtors said 63 percent of buyers this year paid cash, compared with 30 percent nationwide, according to the national Realtors' report. Most of those buyers, the organization said, were investors.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Richman said they had paid $217,000 for a condo in foreclosure on the 10th floor for their daughter Alanna, a jewelry designer who divides her time between New York and Miami Beach. They considered this a deal because it needed work. ''It had black floors,'' she said, which they knew would be expensive to refinish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For their own unit, on the 12th floor, Mrs. Richman said she thought they had paid about $50,000 too much, but they wanted something in move-in condition, and it had recently been renovated. At $370,000, the price was still below the condo's replacement value, the real estate term for what it would cost to rebuild it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to try it for a year,'' she said. ''It's just another asset class. We think it will go up in value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a time of financial and economic uncertainty, both snowbirds and international clients seem to be motivated by more than Miami Beach's natural beauty. ''There's a certain confidence in parking their cash here right now, as opposed to leaving it in the stock market or whatever country they're from,'' Allison Turk, an agent with EWM Realtors, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across Biscayne Bay, in Miami proper, the story is slightly different. During the bust, many high-rise condominium complexes that sprang up along the water remained vacant and unfurnished, leading to the joke that they were not seafront but ''see through.'' Ms. Turk said the buildings were no longer unoccupied but filled with renters, not the buyers developers had hoped for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another difference from years past is who is buying. It is not the leveraged buyer of the boom but wealthier people who are looking for safe harbors for their money. Their hope is for a 2 or 3 percent return on the properties today that will grow to an 8 or 10 percent return in five to 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such returns would be very generous -- or the sign of another bubble. But buyers believe that vacation homes in crucial markets are priced at the bottom, while investors from abroad see these areas as safe harbors that could drive up their returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marlon Young, chief executive of <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>'s private bank in the Americas, said many of his wealthy clients in Latin America, particularly Brazil, were buying upward of 20 properties in hard-hit vacation areas like Florida and California just for this reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They've increased their exposure to real estate from 10 to 15 percent to 15 to 30 percent'' of their overall portfolios, Mr. Young said, adding, ''If you can buy real estate at or just slightly above replacement cost, that is a screaming buy for these clients. They're not new to the real estate market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, not everyone is so sanguine on real estate as an investment. David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, a wealth management firm, said anyone buying a second home should think of it as a consumption good and not an investment. He said the idea that it would appreciate in value was a return to the mind-set that got so many Americans saddled with homes they could not afford -- and may now be selling at a loss as demand perks up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Go ahead -- buy it and enjoy it but don't treat it as an investment,'' Mr. Rosenberg said. ''I'm not saying houses are going down another 30 percent. The worst is behind us. Eventually the market will clear, but it will clear at a lower price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most people, paying cash for a house is not realistic. Bob Donovan, regional sales executive for the New York-New Jersey area at Bank of America Home Loans, said it was a misconception that mortgages were not available for second homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's financing available, but we're in a full documentation environment,'' Mr. Donovan said. ''Where transactions get held up, whether primary or secondary homes, is those situations where we don't have a full picture upfront. It just leaves an open hole for something for go wrong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers should expect to put down 20 to 30 percent of the value of the property. And they should not expect to move quickly. Mr. Donovan said the bank no longer preapproved buyers for a mortgage but gave them what he called a ''prequalification'' to tell them what type of financing was available to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the most successful applicants were the ones who provided all of their income and credit information in advance and took the time to make sure it was complete and verifiable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mrs. Richman, a youthful woman who smiles easily, being in her new condo clearly makes her happy. She has already had a favorite item, gigantic purple chair, shipped from Connecticut, and she said she was excited about her children and friends visiting this winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she also is keenly aware that their investment is doing well. Their daughter fixed up her apartment and is applying for a mortgage to pay back her parents. ''It's already gone up $15,000 since April,'' Mrs. Richman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so the real estate cycle begins again.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE owners of a house for sale in mid-country Greenwich have captured the interest of local real estate agents with the promise of a $100,000 bonus for bringing a buyer through their door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An e-mail blast went out a couple of weeks ago notifying agents that the owners of 6 Wyckham Hill Lane, listed for $4.9 million, are offering the hefty premium until Thanksgiving. The $100,000 is to be paid on top of the agent's share of the sales commission, which is typically 5 percent in Greenwich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julianne C. Ward, a sales associate with Prudential Connecticut Realty, called the size of the bonus ''extraordinary,'' even for one of the most affluent areas in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's huge,'' she said. ''I've been doing this for 24 years, and I've never seen a bonus this big.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of zeros is intended to generate more showings for a property that has sat on the market for more than a year and faces considerable competition, according to Robert Bland, the manager of the Greenwich office of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, which has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though 32 houses have sold this year in the range of $4 million to $6 million, plenty more await buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fact is, in this price range there are currently 61 houses on the market in Greenwich,'' Mr. Bland said. ''So you have to somehow figure out a way to attract attention.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An attention-grabber this big is akin to a child's temper tantrum, ''full throttle, fists and feet,'' Monica Webster, a sales associate with Coldwell Banker, said jokingly. Calling the approach a telling sign of the rough market, she compared it to a grander version of the catered lunches that she uses to increase agent traffic at her open houses. Free food alone is enough to triple her traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Would I be more likely to show a house with a bonus like that? Absolutely,'' Ms. Webster said. ''Why wouldn't I? You try not to be biased, but ... yeah.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Offerings of cash bonuses to real estate agents are perfectly legal in Connecticut, as are offerings of extravagant gifts like cars and exotic vacations. State law simply stipulates that gifts must be given to the brokerage, not individual agents, who are prohibited from working out side deals on property sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But from a buyer's perspective, cash incentives to agents are admittedly not as straightforward as, say, a price cut or an offer to pay closing costs, said Eugene Marconi, the general counsel for the Connecticut Association of Realtors. He advises buyers' agents to disclose such incentives to their clients, lest they later be accused of having steered them toward a particular property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disclosure of a cash bonus offering is also material to buyers' interests. A big incentive makes a statement about the sellers' confidence, and suggests that the price is more negotiable than the buyer might have thought, Mr. Marconi added. ''The buyer may bargain harder on purchase price once he knows what the real price is,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of generating more showings, bonuses are effective only if the property in question is priced right, Ms. Ward said, particularly these days, when ''buyers are so oriented on price.'' She has been on both the giving and receiving ends of bonuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers' focus on getting a good deal might cause some to question whether a big bonus comes at their expense. If a buyer were to suggest that the $100,000 incentive should instead have taken the form of a price cut, Ms. Ward added, then ''a good broker might say, 'I'll split it with you.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some agents avoid such incentives altogether. John Herman, the owner of the Buyer's Representative real estate company, which works exclusively with buyers, said his policy was to credit back to his client any incentive beyond what amounted to a 3 percent commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volume of single-family home sales in Greenwich was up some 13 percent through September, versus the first nine months of last year, but the median sale price remained flat, at $1.695 million, according to a market report produced by Shore and Country Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest spike in activity occurred in the $5 million to $7 million range. Thirty-five homes sold in that range, almost twice as many as last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners of 6 Wyckham Hill wanted to use a cash incentive to turn some of that business their way, having previously used the strategy to sell a property in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Bland said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 1994, their 20-room stone colonial was recently renovated. It has six bedrooms, seven baths, a two-and-a-half-story atrium, a French country kitchen, a cherry-paneled library and an in-ground pool. The house is on four acres on a cul-de-sac. Cate Keeney is the listing agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Thanksgiving deadline on the bonus offer is intended to ''telescope all the interest,'' Mr. Bland said. ''The whole idea is to energize and raise the level of exposure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incentive might also be a way of inspiring agents to play down what Ms. Ward described as the property's only real drawback: proximity to the Merritt Parkway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Bland insisted that the location wasn't necessarily a hindrance. ''One man's ceiling is another man's floor,'' he said. ''Some people like that area because it's more country and open.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, he reasoned, ''if you live near the Merritt, you can get off it quickly.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose in August in half of the large cities measured by a private survey, a sign that prices are stabilizing in some hard-hit parts of the country. Separately, consumer confidence fell in October to the lowest level since March 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index showed Tuesday that home prices increased in August from July in 10 of the 20 cities tracked. That was the fifth consecutive month that at least half of the cities in the survey showed monthly gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest price increases were in Washington, Chicago and Detroit. The greatest declines were in Atlanta and Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The August figures provide a ''modest glimmer of hope'' that some areas may have bottomed out and could be turning around, said David M. Blitzer, chairman of S.&amp; P.'s index committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that cities in the Midwest -- Chicago, Detroit and Minneapolis -- had shown some strength since May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Detroit, the recovering auto industry has helped lead a small rebound in the housing market. Home prices have risen 2.7 percent since August 2010, making it and Washington the only two cities to post a year-over-year gain in that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detroit was one of the cities hit hardest after the housing bubble burst more than four years ago. Home prices there are coming off 1995 levels. So the gains are relatively small compared with how far prices had fallen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Minneapolis and Chicago, fewer homes are being put on sale, leading to higher prices and better sales figures. That is probably because of fewer foreclosures in those cities. September's drop in homes for sale in the Twin Cities was the largest in more than seven years, according to the Minneapolis Area Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Robert J. Shiller, the co-founder of the index and an economics professor at Yale, told CNBC that overall home prices were ''flat'' and a recovery in the housing market was not on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index, which covers half of all homes in the United States, measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The August figures are the latest available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are certain to fall again once banks resume millions of foreclosures. They have been delayed because of a yearlong government investigation of mortgage lending practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second private group reported on Tuesday that Americans say they feel worse about the economy than they have since the depths of the great recession. Consumer confidence fell in October to the lowest level since March 2009, reflecting the big hit the stock market took this summer and frustration with an recovery that does not feel like one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer sentiment came in at 39.8, down about six points from September and seven points lower than economists were expecting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading is still well above the 26.9 recorded two and a half years ago. But it is not even within shouting distance of 90, which is what it takes to signal that the economy is on solid footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists watch consumer confidence closely because consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity. The index measures how shoppers feel about business conditions, the job market and the next six months.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warren Street between Bond and Nevins offers many of the things well-off buyers seek in Brownstone Brooklyn: a pastoral, leafy feel; long rows of 19th-century town houses; proximity to transportation and charming little restaurants; young families on the block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the block also has something that those buyers have traditionally seemed to avoid: two large public housing projects that stand tall at either end, to many New Yorkers enduring symbols of danger, social dysfunction and blight. The map showing the neighborhood on the Web site of the Boerum Hill Association -- a group dedicated to preserving and enhancing ''the unique qualities of our neighborhood'' -- includes Warren Street but runs up and around to Wyckoff at points to cut the projects out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as one commenter on the blog Brownstoner, responding to an item about price cuts at a condominium development on the block, wrote in 2008: ''This might as well be part of the projects. Worst possible location. I would not move my family there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, this being Brooklyn -- which GQ recently named the ''coolest city on the planet,'' despite its being a borough -- the presence of the Gowanus Houses, a 1,134-unit development on the west end of the block, and Wyckoff Gardens, 528 apartments on the east end, does not seem to put much of a damper on values. Properties on the block, which do not turn over frequently, may sit awhile before selling, but on a per-square-foot basis, buyers no longer seem to be getting deep discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the condo development, for instance, sales fell from a high of $588 per square foot in 2008 to a low of $305 per square foot in 2009, but rose to $639 per square foot last year for a four-bedroom apartment that went into contract at $1.15 million, according to Streeteasy.com. On a stretch of Bergen Street two blocks away, farther from the projects, sales prices for single- and multifamily homes generally ranged from a low of $374 per square foot in 2007 to $694 this year, having reached a high of $1,079 at the end of last year, for a fully renovated single-family town house that retained many of its original details, according to available data from Streeteasy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, a local property owner, John Grant, who developed the Grant Mews, an 18-unit condo complex completed in 1990, is looking to take advantage of the rise in values and retire. He has listed a four-family town house at 486 Warren with exposed brick, wood-burning fireplaces and an annual rent roll of $87,600 for $2.5 million, or $658 per square foot -- about $35 less than two multifamily houses that sold this year on Bergen Street. There is also a 2,400-square-foot duplex at the Grant Mews on the market for $1.7 million, or $708 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joan Joseph-Alexander, who is marketing the town house through her company Ambassador Realty, said she arrived at the price after looking at sales in the ZIP code and factoring in the appeal of living within walking distance of the <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> Center, the arena under construction at Atlantic Yards, but shielded from the traffic and noise it is expected to bring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were down; now we are up,'' Ms. Joseph-Alexander said of the Brooklyn market as she waited on Sunday for prospective buyers at an open house. (They never showed up.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added that the influx of a professional class had increased the police presence in the area. ''When the market is down, the projects are a factor,'' she said. ''When it is up, the projects aren't a factor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent study from the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University suggests this is true, finding that higher-income households, particularly renters and first-time homebuyers, are more likely to move into relatively low-income neighborhoods in cities where house values are climbing rapidly. Another study from the center found that federally subsidized housing in New York did not typically depress values within a roughly four-block radius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In New York City I think we've seen upward pressure on property values in a much broader variety of neighborhoods than we had 20 years ago, including many neighborhoods that are abutting and surrounding public housing,'' said Ingrid Gould Ellen, co-director of the center and a co-author of both papers. She named Chelsea, Boerum Hill and Red Hook as among the many neighborhoods with large public housing developments and ''very, very high property values.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Warren Street, that juxtaposition has some of the longtime residents concerned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I bought this house for $17,000 in 1972,'' said Charlie Soule, a retired administrator with the Education Department, shaking her head in disbelief at the $2.5 million asking price for 486 Warren. Back then, she said, the block felt safer because she knew all her neighbors -- something that is no longer true. ''I feel like I've sort of outlived my time on the block,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Rodriguez, who grew up in the house a few doors down and still lives there with his family, had a similar take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You got too much 'ippity' folks around here,'' he said. ''They're uppity, but I call them 'ippity,' '' he added, laughing and brushing his hand under his chin. ''They look at you like you don't belong here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents say that they do not worry so much about the presence of public housing as about what they see as a lack of police enforcement in driving away drug traffic. Dealers hang out at the corner of Bond, where a 16-year-old girl was shot to death last year, said Steven Turner Hart, a writer who has lived on the block since 1998. At Nevins, an abandoned building plays frequent host to crack addicts, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he loves it there. ''I have learned a lot from my neighbors about the ebb and flow and invisible current of this neighborhood,'' he said, referring to how it has evolved over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then too, he added, there was the sense of connection he found when his first wife died in 2009 after a long bout with cancer. They barely left the house, he said, and he thought the block had forgotten about them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But that wasn't true at all: they were quite cognizant'' of his situation, he said. ''People are not nosy but they are friendly and very helpful and good hearted.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He paused, and laughed, adding, ''Except for when they're shooting at you.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ORLANDO, Fla. -- Ernest Markey lost his stone-cutting business in 2009. He then sold his home for half a million dollars less than its value at the peak of the housing bubble and moved with his wife, Marie, to a smaller home in a less affluent suburb. They gave up two new cars and bought one. Used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Markeys have since patched together a semblance of their old life, opening a new stone-cutting shop. But they do not expect that they will ever recover financially from the loss of equity in their old home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For two years I kept thinking that things would get better,'' Mr. Markey, 51, said as he stood in his empty store on a recent weekday. ''Now I think the future doesn't look so good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States has a confidence problem: a nation long defined by irrational exuberance has turned gloomy about tomorrow. Consumers are holding back, businesses are suffering and the economy is barely growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are good reasons for gloom -- incomes have declined, many people cannot find jobs, few trust the government to make things better -- but as Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, noted earlier this year, those problems are not sufficient to explain the depth of the funk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has led a growing number of economists to argue that the collapse of housing prices, a defining feature of this downturn, is also a critical and underappreciated impediment to recovery. Americans have lost a vast amount of wealth, and they have lost faith in housing as an investment. They lack money, and they lack the confidence that they will have more money tomorrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many say they believe that the bust has permanently changed their financial trajectory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People don't expect their home to regain value, and that's really led to a change in consumer attitudes about the economy that we've just never seen before,'' said Richard Curtin, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan who directs its Survey of Consumers. The latest data from the survey, released Friday by Thomson Reuters, shows that expectations for economic growth have fallen to the lowest level since May 1980.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Orlando, a city that trades in upbeat fantasies, the housing crash has been particularly painful. The total value of area homes has fallen below the total mortgage debt on those homes, according to the real estate analytics firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. In the parlance of the real estate world, Orlando is underwater, a distinction matched by Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know that it's going to get better. We just have to get used to it,'' said Sherry DeWeese, whose home in Ocoee, a northwestern suburb of Orlando, is worth less than she paid for it 13 years ago -- and about a third of its value at the peak of the market. ''It was nothing to buy whatever we wanted. Now we just think about what we really need.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have only recently devoted serious study to how a decline in housing prices affects consumer spending, not least because this is the first decline in the average price of an American home since the Great Depression. A 2007 review of existing research by the Congressional Budget Office reported that people reduce spending by $20 to $70 a year for every $1,000 decline in the value of their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This ''wealth effect'' is significantly larger for changes in home equity than in the value of other investments, such as stocks, apparently because people regard changes in housing prices as more likely to endure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent paper by Karl E. Case, an economics professor at Wellesley College, and two co-authors estimated the decline in home prices from 2005 to 2009 caused consumer spending to be $240 billion lower in 2010 than it otherwise would have been. That figure is equal to about 1.7 percent of annual economic activity, enough to be the difference between the mediocre recent growth and healthy growth. And it does not include all the other effects of the housing crash, including the low level of new home construction, that are also weighing on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roy Pugsley, who owns a pool supply store in Winter Garden, another suburb here, said that he made 2,500 fewer sales during the first eight months of 2011 compared with the same period in 2007. That translates to one less person walking through the doors to buy chemicals or toys or spare parts in each hour that the store is open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pugsley said business actually increased in the early days of the recession; customers had told him they were spending more time at home. But now people buy only what they need for maintenance. ''People realized that it wasn't going to get any better, and they stopped spending on their pools, too,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Milcarsky's Appliance Center in the adjacent town of Longwood, business now comes from people remodeling their own homes rather than builders, and customers are picking cheaper models, said Doug Morey, a sales manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People who might have bought that'' -- he taps a stove with chunky burners, designed to look like it belongs in a restaurant kitchen -- ''are double-thinking it. Everyone has had to cut back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means Milcarsky's has cut back too. The company, which employed 26 people three years ago, now has about a dozen workers, and they are making less in salary and commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I might like to think that I'm middle class, but I'm not. I'm not anymore,'' said Rae-Anne Crotty, a customer service manager at the store. She now shops for groceries at discount stores, she said, and buys gifts for her children at Christmas but not on their birthdays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains the prevailing view of economic policy makers that economic activity will eventually return to the same trajectory as before the recession. Mr. Bernanke and others have said that they see no evidence of any permanent change in the economy. Previous bouts of economic pessimism, as in the early 1980s and early 1990s, went away once growth picked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many people in the Orlando area do not share this confidence, at least not when it comes to their own prospects. Instead, like the Markeys, they are settling into lives of less prosperity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple moved to Orlando 12 years ago from central Massachusetts in search of opportunities. The business Mr. Markey created, Stone Giant, grew to include two factories and 60 employees, and it installed granite countertops in up to 15 new kitchens every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His new company, Winter Park Granite, now installs two kitchens on the average day. He has eight employees but cannot afford health insurance for them or himself. The family income last year was less than a third of the $175,000 that he and his wife made in 2007, their last good year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he sees little room for growth. He has stopped spending money on advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're never going to get that big again,'' he said. ''I was someone employing people and taking people to the good life. Now I'm just trying to survive.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom years in Manhattan real estate, credit was easy, speculators developed building after building to meet rising demand for apartments, and values kept climbing, fed by a flurry of resales. But then Wall Street plummeted and the housing market followed suit, as values deflated and apartment sales came to a standstill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many people had expected cooperatives to be affected by the recent slump in Wall Street, as indicated by the number of calls from bargain hunters looking for so-called distress sales,'' an industry analyst at the time said. ''We found that less than half a dozen apartments were offered for resale as a result of the market break.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analyst could have been describing the panicked freeze that settled over Manhattan after the credit crisis and the fall of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> in 2008, but he was not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year was 1929, just months after the crash. What followed was a rarity in New York real estate: a decade in which the residential property market, measured in purchase price per square foot, declined, according to an analysis of the last 100 years of Manhattan values by Jonathan Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. Mr. Miller looked at a representative sampling of available sales and rental data from news and market reports for Prudential Douglas Elliman, which is celebrating its centennial this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People think that Wall Street is a new phenomenon and that 100 years ago it was all manufacturing, but financial services played such an important role in the economy, and especially in real estate,'' Mr. Miller said, adding that analysts in the 1930s predicted that the market would recover quickly, just as many did when the most recent real estate bubble popped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have this long run-up and then catastrophe strikes and everybody says, 'Oh, it will just be a short period of time and then it will be business as usual,' '' he said. ''But it was a decade after the crash before you start to see a pickup of activity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Miller's analysis, sales prices dropped during the 1930s to $15 per square foot, down from $46 during the boom of the 1920s and $25 in the 1910s, adjusted for inflation. Toward the end of the decade, foreclosures slowed and mortgages became more available, with banks beginning to offer 90 percent financing. Although property values have increased significantly over the years since then -- reaching a high of $1,531 per square foot in the last decade -- they dipped sharply again at the beginning of this one, declining to $1,070.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dorothy Herman, president and chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said she was struck by the parallels between the boom-and-bust cycle then and now, and the role of credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In that era of the Roaring '20s, Wall Street was going great, there was easy credit and there was an emergence of creative financing instruments, to say the least, and all of those factors together created that boom,'' she said. ''We would never have had our boom if we hadn't had easy credit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would take nearly two decades for purchase prices to recover to their pre-Depression levels. But much like now, with banks hesitant to lend and some buildings forced to lease what they could not sell, rentals became more appealing, even to those with the means to buy. Famous tenants of that time included John D. Rockefeller Jr., who rented a 15-room apartment at 740 Park Avenue in 1936, and Walter Chrysler Jr., who took a furnished penthouse at 720 Park in 1934.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those of more modest means, there were buildings like 230 Riverside Drive, which began offering one- to four-and-a-half room suites for rent in September 1931, according to a brochure from the era. ''With ''a magnificent view up, down and across the Hudson,'' proximity to buses, an express subway station at 96th Street and trolleys on Broadway and ''more than ample'' closet space, the building, like many in that era, was marketed as offering both access to the city's center and an escape from it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 25 East 83rd Street, one of the first apartment buildings in New York to have central air-conditioning -- still mentioned as an enticement in a recent listing on Streeteasy.com -- the appeal was an apartment building with the most up-to-date amenities. The brochure explains, in a section titled ''What Air-Conditioning Means to You,'' that families would have fewer colds and that housekeepers could claim victory in ''the everlasting battle against New York's dirt and grime,'' adding, ''The curtains you hang in October will be spandy clean in May.'' At root, though, air-conditioning would provide a bulwark against the vicissitudes of city life: ''If New York gets on your nerves, it means that the peace and quiet of this ultra modern apartment house will help you to relax.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was not just grime and noise from which apartments were meant to protect their residents; it was also the wrong kinds of people. At the Mount Vernon, an apartment complex in Queens with inset gardens, the marketing materials from that time mentioned the proximity to shopping areas, churches, schools and transit, but also that it was in ''restricted Jackson Heights,'' a neighborhood that barred blacks and Jews. Amid the details that occupants could expect to find, like Venetian blinds and a waterproof scenic wall covering above the bathroom tile, was the promise that ''great care is taken in the choice of tenants so as to maintain the splendid character of the Mount Vernon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there were the most exclusive properties of all, like 1020 Fifth Avenue, whose penthouse was still in the hands of the family of its original buyer when it went on the market for $46.5 million the day before Lehman collapsed. It sold this summer for $26.75 million. A sales brochure that appears to be from the 1930s lists that apartment as the most costly, at $150,000; a New York Times article from 1925 reported its sale at that price to Samuel H. Kress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was still something for the budget-minded: a duplex apartment with its own entrance on 83rd Street was priced at $40,000 because of its relatively small salon and second-floor space. ''Here again, however,'' the brochure read, ''the cost as compared to equivalent space and location in a private house is amazingly low.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re ''How to Stop the Drop in Home Values,'' by Martin S. Feldstein (Op-Ed, Oct. 13):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices are falling not primarily because homeowners are defaulting on their mortgages, as Mr. Feldstein writes, but because homeowners paid too much for their houses and banks lent too much money to buyers who couldn't repay. The housing debt problem lies between those buyers and lenders; they need to negotiate a solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be that the continued expectation of more bailout money is keeping buyers and lenders from seriously dealing with their issue. More bailout money only supports earlier bad decisions and unsustainable prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In essence, why should the rest of us ''buy the bubble''?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Islesboro, Me., Oct. 14, 2011</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the Editor:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin S. Feldstein is correct that reinvigorating the housing market is crucial for the economy, but his solution is costly and unfair. Spending up to $350 billion to subsidize homeowners who owe more than their home's value unfairly treats taxpayers who avoided mortgages they could not afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A far less expensive strategy to boost demand for owner-occupied dwellings and help the neediest families is to create one to two million homeownership vouchers patterned after the rent voucher system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recipients would pay 30 percent of their income in return for a homeownership voucher. The voucher's value would be the carrying costs (mortgage, taxes and insurance) of homes at the 25th percentile of area home prices. In nearly all localities, current rent vouchers are worth more than these homeownership costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the costs could be offset by phasing out the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, an inefficient subsidy to expand housing supply at a time when demand is the problem.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the Editor:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin S.

Mr. Feldstein's suggestion is not without precedent in American history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1933, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation solved a similar crisis by refinancing one million mortgages, about 20 percent of owner-occupied residences in the United States. The H.O.L.C. also took over the servicing responsibilities, enabling the agency to cut out the middleman and work with homeowners to stay in their homes during difficult economic times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The H.O.L.C. and its refinancing policy stabilized home prices, encouraged homeowners to stay in their homes and earned the federal government a small profit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cambridge, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOMES are the primary form of wealth for most Americans. Since the housing bubble burst in 2006, the wealth of American homeowners has fallen by some $9 trillion, or nearly 40 percent. In the 12 months ending in June, house values fell by more than $1 trillion, or 8 percent. That sharp fall in wealth means less consumer spending, leading to less business production and fewer jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for political reasons, both the Obama administration and Republican leaders in Congress have resisted the only real solution: permanently reducing the mortgage debt hanging over America. The resistance is understandable. Voters don't want their tax dollars used to help some homeowners who could afford to pay their mortgages but choose not to because they can default instead, and simply walk away. And voters don't want to provide any more help to the banks that made loans that have gone sour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But failure to act means that further declines in home prices will continue, preventing the rise in consumer spending needed for recovery. As costly as it will be to permanently write down mortgages, it will be even costlier to do nothing and run the risk of another recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices are falling because millions of homeowners are defaulting on their mortgages, and the sale of their foreclosed properties is driving down the prices of all homes. Nearly 15 million homeowners owe more than their homes are worth; in this group, about half the mortgages exceed the home value by more than 30 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most residential mortgages are effectively nonrecourse loans, meaning creditors can eventually take the house if the homeowner defaults, but cannot take other assets or earnings. Individuals with substantial excess mortgage debt therefore have a strong incentive to stop paying; they can often stay in their homes for a year or more before the property is foreclosed and they are forced to move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overhang of mortgage debt prevents homeowners from moving to areas where there are better job prospects and from using home equity to finance small business start-ups and expansions. And because their current mortgages exceed the value of their homes, they cannot free up cash by refinancing at low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration has tried a variety of programs to reduce monthly interest payments. Those programs failed because they didn't address the real problem: the size of the mortgage exceeds the value of the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To halt the fall in house prices, the government should reduce mortgage principal when it exceeds 110 percent of the home value. About 11 million of the nearly 15 million homes that are ''underwater'' are in this category. If everyone eligible participated, the one-time cost would be under $350 billion. Here's how such a policy might work:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the bank or other mortgage holder agrees, the value of the mortgage would be reduced to 110 percent of the home value, with the government absorbing half of the cost of the reduction and the bank absorbing the other half. For the millions of underwater mortgages that are held by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government would just be paying itself. And in exchange for this reduction in principal, the borrower would have to accept that the new mortgage had full recourse -- in other words, the government could go after the borrower's other assets if he defaulted on the home. This would all be voluntary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This plan is fair because both borrowers and creditors would make sacrifices. The bank would accept the cost of the principal write-down because the resulting loan -- with its lower loan-to-value ratio and its full recourse feature -- would be much less likely to result in default. The borrowers would accept full recourse to get the mortgage reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without a program to stop mortgage defaults, there is no way to know how much further house prices might fall. Although house prices in some areas are already very low, potential buyers continue to wait because they anticipate even lower prices in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the housing bubble burst in 2006, the level of house prices had risen nearly 60 percent above the long-term price path. So there is no knowing how far prices may fall below the long-term path before they begin to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I cannot agree with those who say we should just let house prices continue to fall until they stop by themselves. Although some forest fires are allowed to burn out naturally, no one lets those fires continue to burn when they threaten residential neighborhoods. The fall in house prices is not just a decline in wealth but a decline that depresses consumer spending, making the economy weaker and the loss of jobs much greater. We all have a stake in preventing that.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK CITY real estate is a canvas that is never quite finished -- its landscape and skyline are constantly being redrawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So even though the real estate market is flat, older buildings continue to be demolished, new foundations continue to be dug and new buildings continue to rise. Finding out, though, what the hole in the ground across the street is to become is not always easy. Sometimes homeowners don't discover that the four-story building next door has been sold to a developer with high-rise plans until a demolition crew arrives with a backhoe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for anyone trying to buy or sell an apartment near a development site, knowing what's being built is a must, since property values can be affected. Public records and real estate Web sites can reveal a great deal of information. Real estate blogs sometimes trade in rumor, but they can also offer reliable research conducted by real estate-obsessed New Yorkers across the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The progress of a development should also figure into timing the sale of a nearby apartment. Brokers say that it is best to wait until a building is well under way, or at least until the frame is in place, because buyers and sellers can then have an idea of whether a fabulous view will be lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The unknown is the biggest problem,'' said Eva Gellin, a senior vice president of Halstead Property who has a listing on East 78th Street that overlooks a giant construction pit at the corner of Third Avenue and 79th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A one-bedroom, it came on the market in March at $685,000 and has had its price reduced several times, most recently to $599,000. ''People walk in and say how charming and lovely the apartment is,'' Ms. Gellin said. ''Then they go into the bedroom, look out the window and say, 'Oh.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bedroom has a view of the development site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Offers have not been forthcoming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners, Rachel and David Justus, said that the developers had kept the building's co-op board informed, and that they had known for a while that a rental building of about 20 stories was planned for the site. The Justuses have lived in their apartment for nearly 10 years, and they watched as several low-rise walk-ups on the corner were vacated, boarded up and demolished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lot sat empty for a while, but digging began this summer. ''Our 1 1/2 -year-old son has been enthralled by the work,'' Ms. Justus said. ''He's happier to look at that than to watch TV.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Justus said concerns about the impact of the new building are ''understandable but overblown, given that the view was never an important asset for our apartment.'' He said he and his wife bought it for its prewar charm -- the fireplace, the beamed ceilings -- and the gracious layout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Justus acknowledged that the new building may diminish some of the light that currently comes into the bedroom, ''but I don't think the end result will be as bad as people fear.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renee Fishman, another vice president of Halstead, said that the beginning of a construction project, before specific building plans or timetables are available, is the worst time to try to sell a nearby apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A project is starting right now next to the Victoria, a 22-story building at 7 East 14th Street, where Ms. Fishman lives and has helped sell several apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The School Construction Authority recently bought and demolished a two-story building behind the co-op and plans to build a middle school and high school in its place. The co-op did not learn about the planned school until officials approached the board in February for permission to come onto the Victoria's property to start demolition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orly Nhaissi, the co-op board secretary, said residents had felt blindsided by the school project. But it was in May 2010, at a public hearing that the local community board supported the School Construction Authority's plans to buy the 15th Street site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victoria co-op board members said they had not known about the meeting and felt they should have been notified directly, since the school site abuts their building. The community board had posted notice of the hearing on its Web site. It had also sent an alert via an e-mail blast to its general list and put up flyers around the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Final designs have yet to be completed, but the school will be 116 feet high, or about as high as the 12th floor of the Victoria. As many as 40 percent of residents will lose views or light by the time the school is finished, Ms. Nhaissi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I met people who recently bought an apartment on the fourth floor, when they had no idea that a building would be built right in front of their windows,'' she said. ''They're devastated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Fishman said several apartment owners had approached her about selling. ''For the people who don't need to sell and are just anxious about the building going up, I say, 'Let's take a deep breath,' '' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the apartment overlooks the construction site and is below the 12th floor, her counsel is the same: ''Now is not the time, because we're dealing with too much uncertainty.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having schematics of a planned building would help allay nervousness, but waiting until the building is already rising would be even better, she said. ''Then we can deal with what the impact is going to be,'' she said. ''The worst known is better than the unknown.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, a nearby construction zone does not lower an apartment's value, but a ruined view can. ''If the price of an apartment is being driven partially by its view,'' said Michael Vargas, the president of Vanderbilt Appraisal, ''then we have to consider what the impact is once the view is lost.'' Good views can contribute 10 to 15 percent more to an apartment's value, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Victoria offers a good example of what a building can do to influence how its new neighbor will be built. Once demolition began, Ms. Nhaissi said the co-op ''became very vocal'' about its concerns. The board hired a lawyer and contacted city representatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the help of Councilwoman Rosie Mendez, the board met with school construction officials and received assurances that the number of students at the proposed school would drop to 733 from 866. School officials also agreed not to pursue zoning changes that would have increased the height of the school beyond 116 feet. They also increased the distance between the buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The co-op board's request that the school use frosted glass in its windows to keep students from peering into people's homes was rejected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Nhaissi says that although the building recognizes the need for more schools, many residents are worried about their property values, and ''none of us will really know how it will affect us until it's built.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For sellers, it may be tempting to keep mum about a new development, especially if construction hasn't started yet. But full disclosure is safer, ''because you don't want a deal to go south because of lack of transparency,'' said Frances Katzen, a managing director of Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year, Ms. Katzen sold a two-bedroom apartment at 30 West 15th Street that had views of the Empire State Building, but also looked across to a planned 25-story condo that will be much taller than any of its neighbors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She searched real estate Web sites and public records to find out everything she could about the development. Sites like PropertyShark and the city's finance department can reveal who owns a building, while the building department site can provide building permits -- even ones that have not yet been approved. Online, Curbed and Streeteasy provide running commentary from local residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of 31 West 15th Street, other nearby buildings had tried to block the construction, so the co-op board at 30 West 15th was well versed on its progress. Ms. Katzen said she disclosed what she knew to potential buyers and eventually found one who did not mind the fact that the living room view ''was going to be compromised, because the bedroom view was going to remain open.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers agreed that trying to project the impact on an apartment's views of a building yet to be built can be tricky but can sometimes help sell an apartment, especially if not all views will be affected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Fishman recently represented the owner of a 50th-floor apartment at Metropolitan Tower, at 146 West 57th Street, which is across the street from One57, a 90-story residential building and hotel being erected by the Extell Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One57 has risen above 25 stories, but even earlier in the year, when Ms. Fishman was showing her listing, there was enough of a framework to go by. She could inform potential buyers that One57 would not change the apartment's primary view of Central Park, which is to the northeast, because the Metropolitan's upper floors are in a triangular tower and do not directly face One57.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is one angle of the park view, however, that One57 will affect. Even though the direct view from the living room is to the northeast, she said, ''people would still walk right up to the window, crane their head to the left and say, 'But we're going to lose the view of the park in this direction.'' The loss of that stilted view of Central Park was enough to turn off many buyers, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Fishman eventually found a buyer who understood that ''walking right up to the window and turning your head to look at the park is not the way you're going to live in the space, and the spectacular view you see when you walk in or are sitting at your couch is not going to change,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having said all this, however, there are times when the sight of construction out the window might be cause for celebration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heather McMaster, a vice president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, has sold several apartments at the Milk Factory lofts in Park Slope, a co-op next to an empty lot. It was once home to a gas station, and a handsome new building, she said, ''can increase values for everything around it.'' (There were plans for a 12-story building, but the lot is now back on the market.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any new structure would front on Fourth Avenue, the scene of a great deal of high-rise development since it was rezoned in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While critics have complained about the design and scale of some of these apartment towers, Ms. McMaster said that construction along Fourth Avenue ''in general has improved the avenue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a neighborhood like Park Slope, finding out what's being built can be as simple as a phone call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peggy Aguayo, the owner of Aguayo &amp; Huebener, a Brooklyn real estate agency, said, ''Everyone always wants to know what's going on their block, and as a broker, it's my duty to do the due diligence for them.'' She takes note of building permit numbers on scaffolding walls and then researches the plans on city Web sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes she calls the emergency number posted at a construction site -- ''they might talk to you, and they might not.'' Other times, she contacts the community board or a city council member.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If she knows the architect or developer, she calls directly. ''If they know I'm representing someone on the block, they'll talk to me,'' Ms. Aguayo said, ''because they want to be liked on the block. They don't want someone calling in complaints and getting stop-work orders.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A hole in the ground really doesn't have to be that much of a mystery, she added. ''You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By VIVIAN S. TOY   </div><div>593 words</div><div>4 October 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>27</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Manhattan real estate market remained resilient in the last three months, with prices holding steady and sales volume going up, despite the wild gyrations of the stock market over the summer and continued fears of global economic crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for Manhattan apartments held steady, with the city's largest brokerage firms finding median prices of between $850,000 and $911,333, according to sales reports that will be released on Tuesday. The number of sales during the quarter, however, was up by more than 15 percent compared with the same time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The prices are boring, but the volume is exciting,'' said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. Her agency's data showed 3,750 sales marketwide, the highest number since mid-2008, before the market crashed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Liebman said the market slowed briefly in early August, after a credit rating agency downgraded the nation's debt rating and the financial markets took a series of unpredictable swings. ''But we've become much more used to that type of volatility,'' she said. ''If that had happened a couple years ago, we would have lost hundreds of deals, but as it was, people paused for a few days and then came right back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property, said she saw the relatively flat market as good news. ''What we predicted and actually hoped for was slow and steady recovery,'' Ms. Ramirez said. ''And that's what we're continuing to see.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average sales prices rose by 1 percent from last year, to $1.437 million, largely because of an increase in the number of transactions above $5 million, according to data from Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The uptick in the average sales price is thanks to the high-end market,'' said Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens. The price of Upper East Side apartments with three or more bedrooms, for example, went up 29 percent, to $4.54 million, primarily because there were five sales of more than $20 million, compared with just one such sale last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dottie Herman, the chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said many of the high-end sales were going to foreign buyers. ''We're seeing more foreigners than we did during the boom,'' Ms. Herman said. ''It's because the dollar is so weak and with the whole world in a mess, people feel that real estate in New York is still a lot more stable than elsewhere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the brokerages reported increased sales volume for studios and one-bedroom apartments. The number of studios and one-bedrooms sold in the last quarter rose to 1,500, a 26.7 percent increase from 1,184 the same time last year. Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and the author of Elliman's report, noted that the 1,500 sales did not represent a boom so much as a return to historic norms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entry-level-apartment sales lagged in the last two years, when rents were weak and many landlords offered incentives, but rents have rebounded this year, giving people incentive to become first-time buyers. Mr. Miller said the increase in sales of smaller apartments was also probably a result of mortgage rates' remaining low. ''That's also significant because mortgage underwriting has actually tightened and you essentially have to have quadruple-A credit just to get a mortgage,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Hurricane Irene roared up the East Coast this summer and drew a bead on Manhattan, hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers were surprised to learn they had something in common: They were living in Evacuation Zone A and potentially at imminent risk of being flooded out of their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg declared a state of emergency, shut down mass transit and urged some 300,000 people to flee to higher ground. But aside from some soggy streets, frayed nerves and a miserable Monday commute, New York City was spared the worst of the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It did, however, put a spotlight on the city's waterfront, where in recent years, hundreds of millions of dollars of public money has been spent to improve parks, build esplanades and create the infrastructure necessary for residential development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction of pricey rental and condo towers along the shoreline, in neighborhoods like Battery Park City, Long Island City and Williamsburg, has transformed warehouse and wharf districts. New buildings and planned projects will add thousands of apartments over the next decade, helping ease a projected housing crunch as the city's population balloons past nine million people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, council members revised the building code to recognize the city as being within a hurricane-prone region. Under the updated code, all new building design and construction is required to be hurricane-resistant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of Tropical Storm Irene, builders and real estate brokers say that new developments are adequately protected from storms. Yet despite those assurances, Irene brought into sharp relief the fact that building on a shoreline comes with risks, even in a city where nature can seem to have been nearly completely tamed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carli Iannotto, a 25-year-old office manager, was in her apartment at 2 Gold Street, a 51-story downtown rental tower, as the storm approached. If she had had her druthers, she would have left her $3,095-a-month one-bedroom and stayed with her parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was very, very nervous the whole time,'' Ms. Iannotto said, ''But my boyfriend was adamant about staying.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as she watched neighbors load up their luggage and leave, she said she became ''even more freaked out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having come through the storm unscathed, Ms. Iannotto says she isn't worried about living on the waterfront. But even before the storm, she and her boyfriend planned to move to a new apartment well inland in Williamsburg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think most people are concerned about living on the water,'' she said. Even so, she said, she is glad that in her new home she will not have to think about evacuation routes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is studying ways to limit damage from storm surges and flooding, some already adopted by developers. Those outlined in the city's comprehensive waterfront development plan, ''Vision 2020,'' include the installation of retractable water-tight gates at the entryways of buildings; investing in the maintenance of seawalls and bulkheads; creating ''soft edges'' along the shoreline that can accommodate surging tides; and restoring or creating wetlands and barrier islands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city says such measures would help protect against the long-term effects of climate change, which by raising sea levels will not only alter the shape of the shoreline but also heighten the severity of flooding from even minor storms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to ''Vision 2020,'' sea levels by 2050 could be 12 to 29 inches higher than they are today. By 2080, they could be some 55 inches higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the breadth of New York Harbor and the various bays and estuaries, rising sea levels and the threat of storm surges could affect wide swaths of the region. As Hurricane Irene approached -- even though it was downgraded at the last minute to tropical storm status -- evacuation orders were issued from Long Island and the Rockaways to Jersey City and Hoboken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon McMillan, the director of planning for the developer TF Cornerstone, which has riverfront projects in Queens, said his company was well aware of the challenges of building on the waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than three decades ago he worked on Battery Park City, the project that in many ways set the template for waterfront development to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The original plan, dating back to the 1960s, was to have the whole project raised to 32 feet above sea level,'' Mr. McMillan said. Using land taken from the digging of the massive foundation for the World Trade Towers, the idea was to create an elevated neighborhood, cut off from the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Back then we had a much more defensive attitude toward the water,'' he said. It was not so much storms and sea levels that gave planners pause, but rather the fact that the shoreline was not considered attractive -- although that is hard to believe nowadays. Visitors to the neighborhood would have driven down the West Side Highway, entered a parking garage and then taken an elevator up to the enclave of Battery Park City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Largely because of the cost, however, that plan fell through, leading to the creation of Battery Park City as we know it today, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wanted to pull the adjacent context of the city right up to the shoreline,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its lowest point, on the esplanade on the southern tip of Manhattan, Battery Park City is only seven feet above sea level. As it turns out, the storm surge from Irene did slosh over the esplanade's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal safety aside, a concern in every coastal area is the effect of a big storm on property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary L. Malin, the president of the Citi Habitats, a large rental brokerage firm, described the impact of Tropical Storm Irene as ''a nonevent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is always a segment of the population that is supercautious,'' he said, ''but that is maybe a handful of people at best. We have not seen any renters shy away from that neighborhood,'' he added, referring to Battery Park City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, the president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said, ''It would take more than a few inches of water to keep New Yorkers from buying a property they love.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate analysts say that even when property is damaged in a storm, a single event does not have long-term impact on values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you are dislocated for a day and half out of Battery Park City, you shrug it off,'' said Barry F. Hersh, a clinical associate professor at the Schack Institute of Real Estate of New York University. ''If something really bad happens it will affect values, but they tend to rebound if it is a single event. It is amazing how quickly people forget.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if there are repeated events, he said, values do take a tumble. Mr. Hersh cited a study that examined the coastal housing market in Carteret County, N.C. Between 2000 and 2004, the price of a home considered to be at a heightened risk of flooding was 7.3 percent lower -- $11,600 on average -- than a property that was high and dry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The major projects under way along the water today, including Hudson Yards on the West Side of Manhattan, Queens West in Long Island City, and a new phase of the Edge in Brooklyn, take the approach that building bulkheads or armoring the waterfront is not sufficient. (The ''Vision 2020'' report says that tactic ''would not adequately address risks, would become increasingly costly, and would have negative ecological consequences for our waterways and coastal areas.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McMillan of TF Cornerstone is once again working on a major waterfront development, Queens West, on the site of a former Pepsi bottling company near the foot of the 59th Street Bridge. Four of the seven buildings have been completed, and each, he said, was designed to take into account the threat of storms, floods, rising sea levels and pressure that the river generates on the ground beneath the structures, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can deal with minor flooding,'' he added, ''but what we were chiefly concerned about was protecting the vital infrastructure of the buildings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it added several million dollars to the cost of each building and was not required by zoning regulations, the developer decided to eliminate basements, which is usually where things like boilers and electrical equipment are kept. This move also meant losing valuable square footage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We moved all the vital equipment to the first floor,'' he said. The floors at this level are double slabs of concrete with a watertight seal in between them. There are floodgates that can be employed in the event of a storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a lot we know now that we did not know when we did Battery Park City,'' Mr. McMillan said. ''Over all, I think we have the right balanced approach to the waterfront today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Queens West, many of the precautions taken in the design and layout of the buildings are hidden from view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christine Martin, 31, lives at one of the rental buildings, at 1510 Center Boulevard. She said she was unaware that her building had no basement, and was not concerned about living in the evacuation zone, although she did leave during Tropical Storm Irene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I only left because they said the elevator would not be working and I did not want to walk down 15 flights of stairs with my dog,'' Ms. Martin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Really, the only thing I was a little nervous about was all the construction equipment around here getting tossed around,'' she said. ''But I don't worry about living on the water.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be Prepared: New York residents can find out which hurricane evacuation zone they live in by going to the following Web site and entering their street address: gis.nyc.gov/ oem/he/index.htm</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate listing and brokerage site Redfin has added a tool that gives home sellers access to details about the performance of real estate agents in more than a dozen major markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move continues the continuing Internet shake-up of the real estate world. Web sites like Trulia and Zillow, and local and regional players like streeteasy.com in the New York and New Jersey area, have empowered consumers by putting electronic information about sales and home values at their fingertips. Redfin says it is going a step further, by providing sales data linked to individual agents, to help sellers select a professional to market their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tool can help sellers find agents who are active and who have had success in their specific neighborhood, said Glenn Kelman, Redfin's chief executive. Using information from local multiple-listing services, where agents list the home they are representing for sale, the "Scouting Report" tool provides data on roughly one million agents, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tool isn't comprehensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Various M.L.S. restrictions mean the data isn't available in Redfin's hometown of Seattle, for instance, nor in Palm Springs, Calif.; parts of Atlanta; California's wine country; and Westchester County, in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And because the data goes back three years at the most -- a period when home sales have been slow -- some agents may show no deals at all when you search by their name. But even so, Redfin is going beyond what has generally been available to consumers online, Mr. Kelman said. "Our goal in releasing this information is to help consumers make informed choices about which real estate agent to choose."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In markets where the tool works, sellers can search for agents by name and see their current listings; how many homes the agent has sold in the last three years, or in the past year in some cases; where the homes are located on a map; photos of the homes; the median sales price; the average number of price cuts for each property; and other details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scouting information is available for the following markets served by Redfin: Phoenix; Portland, Ore.; San Francisco and the Bay Area; Sacramento, San Diego and Los Angeles; Chicago; Long Island, N.Y.; Austin and Dallas; parts of Atlanta; Boston; Washington, D.C.; Denver; and Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tool provides information about all agents in many of the markets, Mr. Kelman said, not just those who work directly for Redfin or who partner with it. (Partner agents work for other firms, but agree to offer commission discounts to Redfin clients.) Some markets offer information on all agents, even if they have no affiliation with Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelman says M.L.S. data is generally accurate and up to date, but if an agent finds inaccuracies, the site outlines a procedure to have the information corrected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think the best real estate agents are going to love this," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The service is free to users. Redfin pays for use of the M.L.S. data and earns money from commissions on the sale and listings of homes, Mr. Kelman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you think information like that in the scouting report is helpful in selling your home? And if you sell real estate for a living, please let us know in the comments how accurate the data is on you.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Sales and prices of new single-family homes fell in August despite historically low mortgage rates, underscoring the difficulties policy makers face in trying to help the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A stagnant job market and a big overhang of unsold existing homes have combined to keep new-home sales low even as mortgage rates returned to lows not seen since at least the early 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales slipped 2.3 percent last month to a 295,000 annual rate, a six-month low, the Commerce Department said on Monday. That was in line with analysts' forecasts and did little to allay fears that the United States could slip back into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price also moved lower from the previous month and was 7.7 percent below year-ago levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no sign yet that low mortgage rates are helping the housing sector,'' said Gary Thayer, a strategist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Advisors</span> in St. Louis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve last week announced new measures to ease credit further for home buyers, but analysts cautioned that the level of mortgage rates was not the main hurdle to buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heavy debts taken on during the housing boom in the previous decade are also making consumers cautious to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its monthly report on single-family home sales, the government raised its estimate for July's sales pace slightly to 302,000 units. Also, the supply of homes available on the market in August dropped to a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data last week showed new construction of homes fell in August, dragging on economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing sector can't get any worse,'' said Michael Englund, an economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colo.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DURING the real estate boom, it seemed that every day brought news of a new condominium project in New York. Big or small, classic or modern, luxurious or merely comfortable -- there would be something to satisfy both buyers' needs and buyers' wallets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the fall season begins, this year's crop of condos is sparse. The new and newly converted buildings that are starting sales have had to hurdle the global economic collapse and the credit crisis. Many projects have not survived, and the number of units introduced this year will be a fraction of the total of the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to data compiled by the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, 1,111 new units have opened or are projected to open this year in Manhattan south of Harlem, down from 1,767 a year ago and 8,552 in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For developers whose buildings are about to hit the market, the scarcity of new condos is good news, signaling a lack of competition and, perhaps, higher prices and an end to concessions. For people hoping to buy new apartments, the market is worrisome for the exact same reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not just about rising prices,'' said Kelly Kennedy Mack, the president of Corcoran Sunshine, which markets new and converted condominiums. ''It's also about not having the same kind of choices. Those buyers who are looking for something very unique are going to have a very difficult time finding it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, agreed that inventory is lower. But in Manhattan, especially downtown, he said, there is ample ''shadow inventory'' -- new apartments that are being rented out or held off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn, Mr. Miller said, lower prices have made development financing easier to get, which has led to a steady rise in market share for new condos. In the second quarter of 2010, he said, 14 percent of closed sales in the borough were on newly developed units. By the second quarter of this year, he said, that number had risen to 24.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the buildings entering the market this fall are on the small side. Of the 20 that have opened or are projected to open this year in Corcoran Sunshine's Manhattan coverage area, only 3 have more than 100 units. Brokers marketing the small buildings say they have much to offer in the uncrowded market, including views, historic details and all-around plushness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But several high-rise, high-profile buildings will soon angle for buyers, including one project that promises to change the city's skyline: One57, a 90-story mixed-use tower at 157 West 57th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building, which Extell, the developer, says will be the tallest residential property in Manhattan, 40 rental units starting on the 32nd floor and 95 condominium units starting on the 39th floor, ranging from two- to five-bedrooms, from the 32nd floor up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detailed pricing information has not been released, but Gary Barnett, the president of Extell, said units would cost $3,000 to $7,000 per square foot -- or $3 million and up -- when sales start in November. One57's Web site, which invites potential buyers to ''register your interest,'' gives a price range beginning at $5 million and topping out at $30 million-plus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnett said in an interview that, with construction financing for large projects still difficult to obtain, he believes his building is years ahead of anything comparable entering the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Really nothing is even close to sales, let alone for delivery,'' he said. ''So to some extent, we have the market to ourselves for the next two to three years. The only caveat is, we can't have the world melt down. If the world melts down, all bets are off.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that he did not believe that would happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaun Osher, the chief executive at the brokerage and marketing firm CORE, said several factors had hindered large projects, including the disappearance of large lenders like <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, the reluctance of landholders to sell buildable lots in a weakened market, and a distaste among developers for risk. Large and well-capitalized developers, though, have had more leeway. Extell is one, and Related Properties, which will soon start selling condo units at its new building at 460 West 42nd Street, is another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That project, known as 1 MiMa Tower and designed by Arquitectonica, has 151 condo units along with a 50-story rental component that opened in the spring. They range from studios to three-bedroom units. Joanna Rose, a Related spokeswoman, said prices had not been set.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, one of the country's largest residential developers, has two condo buildings opening in the coming months: the Touraine, a 22-unit structure at 132 East 65th Street with prices from $1 million to $15 million, and 205 Water Street, in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latter, in a cobblestoned part of the neighborhood dominated by converted factories and warehouses, has 65 units. Prices will be around $850 per square foot, according to David Von Spreckelsen, the president of the <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> City Living division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building, designed by GreenbergFarrow, is seeking LEED Gold certification for environmental sustainability, and has apartments ranging from 550-square-foot studios to a 2,300-square-foot penthouse, Mr. Von Spreckelsen said. The list of potential buyers, he added, is more than 1,100 names long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn -- both emerging and established neighborhoods -- is the site of much of the season's new condo development. The reasons, said Mr. Osher of CORE, are economic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's been easier in this market to put deals together that are smaller in size because of financing,'' he said. And Brooklyn, he added, has a lot of sites that can be developed for the available money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the borough's most eye-catching buildings is on a lot where ground was broken years ago. A 14-story, 186-foot tower at 144 North Eighth Street, jutting over an otherwise low-rise section of Williamsburg, it has been under construction since 2005. Because construction started just before a neighborhood zoning change, the building's status as the tallest object for blocks may well remain unchallenged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents' opposition, ownership disputes and the bad economy stalled the project until GFI Development bought it in 2008. The company, and the project's architect, Robert M. Scarano Jr., reduced the planned height by two stories and finished construction. The result is a 41-unit building with on-site parking and a sprawling green roof on the second floor, with areas for flowers and a vegetable garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are views of the Empire State Building, nearby Bedford Avenue and most everything else in between. Sales started this month; units available so far range from a one-bedroom one-bath condo on the fourth floor, for $575,000, to a three-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath unit on the 10th floor for $1.925 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several neighborhoods away, in eastern Brooklyn Heights at 75 Clinton Street, is a rare new condo development for the area. The W Development Company is converting a prewar commercial building there into 74 condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building, with a 5,000-square-foot roof deck and the amenities usual to a new building, among them a gym, officially started sales this month. Apartments range in size from studios to three-bedrooms, and in price from $479,000 to $2.05 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Clinton Hill, NLH Developers is opening Lineage II, designed to evoke vintage brownstones and town houses, at 136-146 Clifton Place. The 48-unit first phase, which went on sale a year ago, is almost sold out, said Jackie Buddie, a spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, which is marketing the project. The second phase, designed by Karl Fischer, has 32 units meant to look, from the outside, like four connected houses. Units there range from 777 to 1,392 square feet, and are priced from $389,000 to $599,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large projects like MiMA and One57 aside, Manhattan condo-hunters will have mostly small and midsize buildings to consider, though smaller does not necessarily mean cheaper. There is 55 Warren Street, in TriBeCa, a converted five-story building with an Italianate limestone facade and just four floor-through apartments. Amenities include a stone-walled wine cellar. Only one condo is listed so far -- a 3,627-square-foot four-bedroom, for $6.75 million -- but the others are expected to cost as much as $16.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Greenwich Village, the season's major new development is 130 West 12th Street, a converted prewar building that was once part of the St. Vincent's Hospital campus, housing both offices and residences. Rudin Management, the developer, bought the building in 2007 and, after St. Vincent's moved out the following year, gutted it, reducing the number of units to 43 from 100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building, where sales are expected to start sometime this fall, will have a rooftop terrace and garden, and units ranging from one-bedrooms of 869 square feet to four-bedrooms of 2,837 square feet. There will also be three duplex penthouses, starting at 3,202 square feet. Prices start around $1.395 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William C. Rudin, the company's chief executive, said prices would reflect the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's very strong demand for quality, elegantly designed, well-located projects,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen G. Kliegerman, the president of Halstead Property Development Marketing, says the scarcity of new condos in the city has several consequences. One is that rents are edging up as fewer people are choosing to buy. Another is that developers and lenders, seeing the opportunity to fill a void, are beginning to make deals on large new developments. Several around the city are planned for 90 to 150 units -- though those projects will not be completed for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, he said, ''I think you'll continue to see inventories reduce, and as that happens you'll see prices slightly increase.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good indication of the market's health, Mr. Kliegerman said, will be sales at projects in less established neighborhoods, including those that started over the summer, or earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New condos in prime neighborhoods, like 15 Union Square West or the Laureate, at 2150 Broadway on the Upper West Side, have already done well, he said, whereas buildings like his own company's 109 Gold Street, in Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn, or 58 Metropolitan Avenue, in Williamsburg, could be bellwethers for buildings off the beaten path. Either way, Mr. Kliegerman said, buyers going condo-hunting should not expect bargains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Developers are starting to say no to negotiations,'' he said, adding that at his company's recently opened Kirkman Lofts, in Dumbo, Halstead had not been listening to lower offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whether it's the buyer, their friend, or the buyer's attorney,'' Mr. Kliegerman said, ''they're all surprised that the developers are able to say no. But what they're realizing is, the developers can say no, because there's such a lack of product out there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: October 9, 2011, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sept. 25 about new condominiums that are about to open in New York City described incorrectly the residences at One57, a 90-story mixed-use tower on West 57th Street being built by the Extell Development Company. There will be 40 rental units starting on the 32nd floor and 95 condominium units starting on the 39th floor. Not all the residences will be condominiums. (There will be a hotel below the 32nd floor.)</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Existing home sales rose more than expected in August to the fastest annual pace since March, as falling prices and low interest rates drew more buyers into the market, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data did little to change the view that housing, hobbled by a burst bubble that prompted a major recession, will not help the economy much anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales climbed 7.7 percent from the previous month to an annual rate of 5.03 million units, the group said. The median price was 5.1 percent lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association said the increase in sales came despite some disruptions from Hurricane Irene, which battered much of the East Coast at the end of the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had expected sales to rise 1.4 percent to a 4.71 million-unit pace. Compared with August 2010, sales were 18.6 percent higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This housing market is still very distressed,'' said Michael Hanson, an economist at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> in New York. ''We have to get a lot of good news for a meaningful turnaround in the housing market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook for housing prices remains grim. A survey by MacroMarkets showed that economists expected home prices to rise just 1.1 percent a year through 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is less than a third of the annual pace clocked in the 13 years that preceded the housing bubble, the survey found. Falling prices can make housing look like a poor investment for many Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed applications for mortgages edged up last week on higher refinancing activity, but were held back by a lack of demand for purchases, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor keeping home prices low is the high rate of ''distressed sales,'' which include those forced by foreclosures. Distressed sales accounted for 31 percent of August transactions, up from 29 percent a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, some other props for the sector are set to fall away. At the end of this month, the size of the loans federal housing agencies can purchase will fall, and next year government-controlled mortgage companies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> will begin to raise fees on the loans they purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jed Smith, an economist with the National Association of Realtors, was nevertheless upbeat that the prices could stabilize soon because he said inventories would most likely decline over the winter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN this do-it-yourself era of online real estate listings, it is easy to find out what is on the market, visit open houses and even research sales data to come up with a reasonable price to offer for a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why should a buyer bother using an agent?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a nutshell: to protect his or her interests in an expensive, often complex purchase that can become even more complicated by the labyrinthine co-op approval process in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A buyer who relies on the seller's agent to handle both sides of the deal may not hear about problems with the apartment or the building, or have a real advocate during contract negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you work with a buyer's agent, their fiduciary responsibility is to you as a buyer,'' said Walter Molony, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors. The organization has helped establish state laws that require clearer disclosure to consumers about which party in the transaction an agent represents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, real estate agents must have clients sign a disclosure form that explains the difference between a seller's agent, who provides undivided loyalty to the seller, and a buyer's agent, who represents the buyer's interests. A dual agent can represent the buyer and the seller, but both parties must consent to the arrangement and acknowledge that they are giving up the benefits of exclusive representation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously if you're representing a buyer and a seller in a transaction,'' said Neil B. Garfinkel, the residential counsel to the Real Estate Board of New York, ''you can't have undivided loyalty.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dual agent can maintain each party's confidence, Mr. Garfinkel said -- for instance, by not disclosing to the seller that the buyer just received a big bonus check, or by not telling the buyer that the sellers are divorcing and want a quick sale. But things get murky when it comes to negotiating a price or discussing a home's flaws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Perhaps it's a defect in the property or potential financial issues in the building,'' said Gea Elika, the founder of Elika Associates, a real estate agency that works exclusively with buyers. ''Or maybe the resale potential is terrible. Buying a home is an emotional thing, so buyers may not see what's wrong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the market was booming, it was sometimes difficult for buyers to find a broker to show them properties unless they had millions of dollars to spend. That is because properties were selling so fast that agents preferred working with sellers rather than buyers who might take months to make up their minds. But agents say that with listings taking longer to sell, there is generally more willingness to work with buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noah Rosenblatt, the founder of the real estate data site Urban Digs, is among the agents who focus exclusively on the buy side of the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The buyer clients who come to me tell me that they're not interested in someone to show them what's on the market,'' Mr. Rosenblatt said. ''Once they find a property they like, my services really kick in at that point.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those services include providing a market analysis, evaluating comparable sales, coming up with an offer based on the value of features like outdoor space, and handling the back-and-forth of negotiations and contract terms. The role of a buyer's agent may also involve preparing a co-op board package and navigating speed bumps that can derail deals, like delayed seller responses to a bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would not allow my client's offer to be used as leverage by a seller who might be entertaining two or three other deals on the side,'' Mr. Rosenblatt said. ''I would put a deadline on the offer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A common uncertainty is at what point a buyer should start thinking about bringing an agent into the picture. Many savvy shoppers are happy to visit open houses on their own, and many even acknowledge, when signing visitor's logs, that they are not working with an agent. But brokers recommend finding a buyer's agent before making an offer or scheduling an appointment for a second viewing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engaging a buyer's agent later in the process opens up the potential for a dispute over whether the new hire is entitled to a portion of the selling agent's commission. Also, by this point in the proceedings, a buyer may have chatted too much with the selling agent, revealing information that could influence the outcome of the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You may have already lost your negotiating power because you've already told them what you'll spend,'' said Kimberly Kahl, the executive director of the National Association of Exclusive Buyer Agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the seller typically pays the agents' commission, that fee comes from the purchase price of the home -- in other words, out of the buyer's pocket -- so buyers who think they have no financial obligation to an agent are deluding themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're paying for it,'' Ms. Kahl said. ''You might as well hire someone to represent you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers worry that if they work with a buyer's agent, their offer may be less attractive to the seller, whose fee to his own agent could be smaller than the full 6 percent if that agent represented the buyer too. In many cases, the listing agreement stipulates a 6 percent commission if the deal is split between brokers and a 5 percent commission if the listing agent represents both buyer and seller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with financing tight and qualified buyers scarce, Mr. Rosenblatt said, for the seller to be swayed on this issue, he would have to receive two very similar offers, with similar terms and financing conditions, and both buyers would have to have similar appeal to a co-op board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How often does that really happen?'' Mr. Rosenblatt asked. ''It happens, but the stars do not align that perfectly often enough that it's something buyers should be paranoid over.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By ROBERT SHAROFF   </div><div>1149 words</div><div>14 September 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHICAGO -- Ian Schrager, whose indefatigable pursuit of buzz over the last 30 years has produced memorable hotels like the Royalton and the Gramercy Park in New York, the Mondrian in Los Angeles and the Delano in Miami Beach, is about to open his first new project as an independent hotelier since the 2008 financial crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schrager's new venture -- which will have a limited opening here on Thursday -- is Chicago's faded but legendary Ambassador East Hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm in an opportunistic business,'' he said on a recent walk-through of the hotel's public spaces. ''You can't have a hotel company without having a hotel in Chicago. I've always wanted one, but never found one to buy until now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hotel, which Mr. Schrager is calling the Public, dates from 1926 and is about a mile north of the Loop central business district in the Gold Coast lakefront residential neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schrager acquired the Ambassador East in the spring of 2010 for $25 million from the Harp Group, a locally based hospitality investment and development firm that paid $44.5 million for it in 2005. Harp Group's lender, <span class="companylink">iStar Financial</span> of New York, retains an interest in the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Basically, it turned out to be an arranged short sale,'' said Adam McGaughy, a senior vice president of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> and Harp Group's broker for the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''It was very good timing for Schrager. At that point, no one knew what was going on in the market. The sky was still falling. He timed it just before the market for investment recovered later that summer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, Mr. Schrager has spent $35 million on the renovation. When added to the purchase price, the total is about $60 million, or just over $200,000 a room, an ostensible deal in a city where luxury hotel properties regularly trade in the range of $300,000 to $400,000 a room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in contrast to other properties that Mr. Schrager has developed, room rates will also be something of a bargain. The Public has 285 rooms, about 30 percent of which are suites. Rates, at least in the beginning, will start at $135 a night, considerably below the average for the downtown Chicago luxury market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downtown Chicago has about 34,000 hotel rooms with overall occupancy expected to reach 71 percent this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The whole idea is there has to be value,'' Mr. Schrager said. This means, he added, ''No $5 Hershey bars in the minibar and no $20 pots of room service coffee. People won't accept that anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He described the Public as ''a paradigm shift.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea is to have a less expensive hotel where you still have great service, great design and an exciting food and beverage concept,'' he said. ''Because I think the country's more complicated now. It's not going to be so much about upward mobility in the future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schrager says he hopes the Public will be the first link in a new chain of boutique hotels across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is his second try at creating a boutique hotel chain in recent years. The first was a star-crossed collaboration with <span class="companylink">Marriott International</span> for a chain called Edition, which was announced with much fanfare in 2007 but has resulted in the opening of only two hotels, in Honolulu and Istanbul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the Public's room rates will be lower than a typical Schrager property, Mr. Schrager said he was not skimping on design, which has been his calling card and a way of compensating for the small room sizes and cramped bathrooms that he acknowledges are a fact of life in many vintage hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm able to take compromised conditions and, through good design, neutralize them,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those who remember outre touches like the giant log that served as a couch in the lounge of the Hudson Hotel in New York may be surprised by the overall restraint of the Public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not design on steroids,'' said Anda Andrei, Mr. Schrager's in-house architect for close to 30 years. ''We wanted to keep a lot of the history there because the bones are so beautiful. It's understated in a way but at the same time glamorous, because there is a certain glamour to clean, beautiful design.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one area of the hotel where some of Mr. Schrager's characteristic outrageousness comes into play is the storied dining room, the Pump Room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the days when cross-country train travel inevitably involved a layover in Chicago, the Pump Room was the local equivalent of New York hot spots like the Stork Club and El Morocco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of visiting celebrities liked to go there and the next day you would read about them in the gossip columns,'' said Tim Samuelson, the City of Chicago's cultural historian. ''The Pump Room always had an edge of coolness to it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two early fans were Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland, both of whom incorporated references to the Pump Room into their respective versions of ''My Kind of Town'' and ''Chicago.'' (Sinatra's favorite booth in a sheltered alcove toward the back has been preserved.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reconfigured Pump Room is dominated by what Ms. Andrei calls ''the constellation,'' an elaborate overhead lighting system of dozens of resin globes attached at various points to what appears to be a steel jungle gym suspended from the ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schrager has teamed up with a celebrity chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The food will be very simple: a blend of what's popular in New York and four or five classic Pump Room dishes,'' Mr. Vongerichten said. ''It's really about keeping affordable prices. Some main courses will be under $20. Most will be between $17 and $28. We'll have something for everyone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One potential drawback for the Public is its location, which is at the northern edge of the downtown area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a challenging location because it's north and residential,'' said Ted Mandigo, the director of TR Mandigo &amp; Company, a hospitality consulting firm in Elmhurst, Ill. ''But that also is part of the charm of the property. You pull up and it's a shady street and the people you see on the sidewalk are the people who live around there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McGaughy of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> agrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not on Michigan Avenue and it's not within two blocks of all the corporate activity,'' he said. ''But I think the kind of savvy travelers Schrager will be targeting will understand the location.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers and investors are starting to make big bets on industrial real estate, following signs that consumers may be starting to spend again. Sales of such properties have jumped nearly threefold from last year, according to figures from commercial real estate companies, and the vacancy rate has fallen for three consecutive quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industrial market is often a leading indicator for commercial real estate, improving before the office market. This is because when companies begin seeing increased demand from consumers their first steps are to increase production and ramp up inventory. ''Only then do they hire new employees and look to grow their offices,'' said Robert C. Kossar, a managing director and the head of the industrial real estate group for New York and New Jersey at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of the market's growth are apparent in the New York metro area. On a brownfield site in Edison, N.J., the J. G. Petrucci Company is building a 570,000-square-foot warehouse even though the developer has not lined up a single tenant. It is one of the first industrial properties built on spec in New Jersey since the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The timing is right because while rents are still low, there are clear signs that the market is tightening,'' said James G. Petrucci, the company's president. ''I am confident that there will be any number of companies wanting this space by the time it is completed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first half of this year, the vacancy rate declined to 9.7 percent, its third quarterly decline and its lowest level since the first quarter of 2009, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield. During the same period, a total of 70 million square feet traded hands, an increase of nearly 160 percent, the brokerage firm said. And year-to-date, leasing activity has risen more than 27 percent to 205 million square feet, compared with the same period last year, the company's research showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you look at the fundamentals over the past six months or so, there is very strong leasing, declining vacancies and positive net absorption,'' said Tim Wang, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">Clarion Partners</span>, which last month purchased 2.8 million square feet in industrial properties from Prologis Inc. for $118 million and is looking for other acquisitions. In addition, ''industrial properties are very simple to operate,'' Mr. Wang said. Even large buildings typically have only one or two tenants; they are less capital-intensive because landlords do not offer tenant improvement allowances or other terms common in office leases; and the cash flow from the rent is mostly stable and predictable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Clarion Partners</span> is one of several companies that have been increasing their industrial properties. Among the biggest buyers is Blackstone, which had meager holdings in the sector before spending $2 billion to acquire 275 industrial buildings earlier this year. Other companies that are buying aggressively include <span class="companylink">Terreno Realty Corporation</span>, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, the Cabot Group and CenterPoint Properties, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matrix Development Group, a private company with offices in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, recently joined with <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> to acquire a 265,000-square-foot warehouse in Robbinsville, N.J. The company is also constructing a 150,000-square-foot industrial building for the beverage distributor Ritchie &amp; Page, also in Robbinsville.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are at the inflection point in the market,'' said Alec Taylor, a principal of Matrix Development. ''Building values are still low, but rental activity and absorption rates are improving. Now is the time to buy buildings and in six months to a year, lease them up and improve their value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ports also play a role in industrial real estate, and in New Jersey investors are making big bets that port business will increase. This is in part because of a $5.25 billion project to widen the Panama Canal by 2014. The widening will allow large cargo ships that currently anchor in California and use trucks or the railroad to move goods to the East Coast to sail directly to New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The widening of the canal could mean big business for Port Newark-Elizabeth, and to prepare for an influx of larger ships the Port Authority of New York and New Jerseyplan to raise the Bayonne Bridge by 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a growing need for shipping that is not showing signs of abating anytime soon,'' said Dave Adams, the president of Port Newark Container Terminal, one of five major terminals at Port Newark. The terminal is positioning itself to take advantage of the improving market conditions. This summer, it extended its lease with the Port Authority, which owns the port, to 2050 and agreed to invest $500 million in capital improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our goal is to be able to double the capacity of our facility from about 650,000 shipping containers a year to 1.2 or 1.3 million,'' Mr. Adams said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the market for larger properties, usually 300,000 square feet or more, that cater to the biggest beverage or food distributors or major retailers is showing improvement, the market for spaces of 50,000 square feet and under is still struggling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a disconnect in the market,'' said John Huguenard, a managing director and head of national industrial investment sales at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. ''Entrepreneurial businesses haven't come back the way big business has.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Long Island, for example, where the industrial market mostly serves local businesses, ''the vacancy rate is around 6.2 percent, which sounds good,'' said Jack O'Connor, a principal and director of the national industrial practice group at Newmark Knight Frank in Long Island. ''But that is because none of the firms track buildings under 20,000 square feet. If they looked at the smaller industrial spaces, they would see a vacancy rate of 10 percent to 11 percent.'' Prices also have dropped: in 2007, smaller warehouses sold for $125 a square foot, but today the price would be closer to $75 a square foot, Mr. O'Connor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller properties are languishing, Mr. O'Connor said, ''because banks aren't lending, and people have no equity in their homes to take out second mortgages to finance new businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even the growth in the market for large industrial properties comes with cautions, experts say. ''The volatility in the financial markets and the picture of a slow recovery, especially with employment, is having a guarded effect,'' Mr. Kossar said. ''The signs are trending in the right direction, they are all pointing toward a recovery, but it is a cautious optimism.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AFTER the shrewd and wary real estate blogger known as Grim (real name: James A. Bednar of njrereport.com) bought his first house in Wayne last spring, he quickly announced where he would start with renovations: the damp basement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Showing and telling with pictures on his blog -- which up to then had concerned itself only with the vagaries of the market and how to get a deal -- Mr. Bednar demonstrated to his hundreds of followers the ''right way'' to keep a basement dry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He excavated dirt to eight inches below the foundation, laid down stones and drainpipes, applied flashing and asphalt coating to the foundation walls, insulated them with foam board, and then regraded the property with backfill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was three months before Tropical Storm Irene; did we mention Grim is shrewd?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bednar's basement did stay dry -- although Wayne, which has many low-lying areas that are federally designated flood plains, was among the hardest-hit communities in the state. President Obama even stopped by Wayne (along with neighboring Paterson) to view the devastation and promise aid in rebuilding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the view of some worried brokers and agents, though, rebuilding buyer confidence in a piece of real estate, once it has gotten wet, may be beyond anyone's powers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anytime there is penetration -- even seepage, even if only under extreme circumstances,'' said Robert Lindsay, an agent at Coldwell Banker who has been selling houses in Wayne for 35 years, ''it will affect property value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Lindsay's view, damage to buyers' confidence in certain neighborhoods, or in specific houses affected by Irene, might take years to repair. ''This is the hottest hot button there is for buyers,'' he said. ''People do tend to have short memories, but in this case, they figure, if it happens once, it can happen again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, of course, extreme circumstances prevail -- and buyers are probably ''gun-shy'' anyway, as Gary Large, the president-elect of the New Jersey Association of Realtors, put it. Mr. Large is also the Morris County manager for Prudential New Jersey Real Estate in Morristown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many towns in northern New Jersey that have high water tables, homes are generally equipped with sump pumps, and often battery backups, since home inspectors usually recommend them when buyers request a report on a home before purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sump pumps are not necessarily enough of a confidence booster in today's climate, said Susan Hunter, the vice president of the Lois Schneider Realtor in Summit. One agent with her company had a closing scheduled for Aug. 30, two days after the storm. During the walk-through inspection, Ms. Hunter said, ''the seller mentioned that for the first time in 30 years,'' because of Irene, ''there had been some minor seepage into one area of the basement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer's lawyer immediately insisted that money be put in escrow to cover the cost of repairs if the situation worsened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Post-storm jitters have also been contagious among lenders, Ms. Hunter said. ''Many banks are now requiring a 'final inspection' by the appraiser to inspect the home for storm damage before closing,'' she said in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have already had a couple of closings delayed by this process,'' she added. ''Unfortunately it can cause a domino effect: if one buyer can't close, the buyer for his house can't close, and so on and so on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State real estate regulations require sellers to disclose whether a basement has ever been wet or damp, and to complete a disclosure form at the time a house is listed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If sellers have not told the truth, and the basement floods after closing, ''there is a viable potential for damages against the seller,'' said Ken Baris, the president of the Jordan Baris agency in West Orange (where there was also widespread basement water damage from the storm).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Mr. Baris's agents, Mary Louie, helped her daughter Frances Louie last year with the purchase of a three-bedroom home in Springfield on a street that lies within a flood plain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We knew it was a flood plain, obviously,'' the younger Ms. Louie said. ''We had to get flood insurance. But there have been a lot of big storms this year, and we never had flooding.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders require buyers in areas categorized as flood plains to obtain the insurance, which is available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. On the Web site, floodsmart.gov, anyone can search whether risk of flooding for a given address is ''low to moderate'' or ''high.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The neighbors said there have been floods,'' Ms. Louie said in Irene's aftermath, ''but nothing ever this bad. There is mud all over the walls in our basement.'' At that point she was still awaiting the arrival of cleanup workers from the town's emergency management office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of her neighbors who have paid off their mortgages had let flood insurance lapse -- and at one house water had risen almost to the second floor. ''I guess they have lost everything,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lindsay recalled clients in the late '90s who had bought a house near a flood plain, but not in it, who were not required to get flood insurance. That changed in 1999 after Hurricane Floyd, which caused extensive flooding in New Jersey. Federal authorities redrew the map to widen the flood plain and include the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a kick in the shins,'' Mr. Lindsay said. ''Now the owners have to accept both the stigma and the cost, around $25,000 a year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When floodwaters entirely recede this time around, Mr. Lindsay said, he predicts that FEMA will again redraw its maps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter the precautions taken, however, the surprise factor is always there, and Mr. Bednar, for all his hard work, was not exempt. ''The basement was bone dry, not a drop of water,'' he reported. ''The chimney, however, let us down. In our defense, we didn't get there with the renovations yet.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charleston, S.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE house on the Bohicket River is not the worst place Sheila and Peter Potter have ever lived. But its weird, empty spaces -- the double-height ''great'' room, the floating gallery -- and abundance of wet bars make it one of the most awkward, as Mr. Potter might say, stroking each syllable with a William F. Buckley Jr. drawl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite these architectural impediments, the Potters have turned the house, a developer's special built three years ago, into a home, filling it with their eclectic, elegant belongings: foot-worn, antique Chinese rugs; tiny, early 18th-century beds; 19th-century artwork. Taming one of the wet bars is an armada of family photos -- Mr. Potter's diplomat parents in a paneled library, Ms. Potter and her seven siblings in a living room on Sutton Place in Manhattan. And on the stereo the other day was Bach lute music, ''a cool sound for a hot afternoon,'' Mr. Potter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nearly 5,000-square-foot house, on the market for $1.499 million, has been home to the Potters since March. It is their 14th residence here in as many years -- and their 14th project as live-in home stagers. For anyone familiar with the perky, manic staging professionals on HGTV, the Potters are a curious example of the breed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Languid tastemakers beamed down from another era (Ms. Potter makes expensive lamps using an 18th-century collage technique, while Mr. Potter is an amateur furniture historian), they have little in common with the affiliates of giant national staging companies like Showhomes, which move house managers into empty luxury properties, or with newbies who have ''graduated'' from online staging academies, paying thousands of dollars for ''accredited'' courses in curb appeal, furniture rental and marketing. He is 61 and she is 57, born in the middle of the baby boomer years, and they don't even own a computer. Yet the Potters are a household name in Charleston, a city known for its great houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have lived in some of the best of them, including an imposing, marble-columned, Greek revival antebellum palace with two guest houses, a maze and a pool, which sold for $4.3 million in 2005, thanks to the Potters' ministrations. (Among the family photos is one of Mr. Potter in an Andy Warhol wig, dancing in front of the marble columns.) Their payment includes living rent- and utility-free, along with reimbursement for their moving costs and often a percentage of the sale, though not always.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are other stagers here, but all they do is bring in furniture, and you really wouldn't want what they have,'' said Thomas Bennett, a principal at Carriage Properties, a luxury real estate firm in the city, and the agent who listed the Greek revival the Potters lived in for a year and a half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a tough house to sell, Mr. Bennett said. During the last century, it had been turned into a county library and then sliced up into apartments. ''It was like a beautiful woman who had had her clothes and her jewelry ripped off, a beautiful body just lying there in the dirt,'' is how he described the place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the Potters' decorating, Mr. Bennett said, that helped buyers look beyond the remnants of the house's hard times. ''Sheila and Peter give a house flair and sophistication,'' he said. ''I think there is probably a need for them more now than ever, because people lack imagination. A lot of people are made of money, and can make money, but fine taste and money don't always go together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings us, ineluctably, to the wet bars. Ms. Potter showed off all three in the Bohicket spec house, including the one in the master bedroom, which is like a little kitchenette, with all-white wainscoting and a granite counter. ''Isn't it weird?'' she said. ''Like an ice cream parlor. What happened to going downstairs for a glass of water?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Potter, who has the husky voice of a former smoker, apologized when a reporter tripped over a little Chinese chest. She apologized, too, for the drive from the airport and for the house's inadequacies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm so sorry,'' she said again, turning on the lights in the downstairs bathroom. ''It's the world's worst powder room. No place to hang a towel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there were Porthault hand towels stacked behind the toilet (the terry cloth ones that really dry your hands), and on the wall, a Japanese wood-block print Mr. Potter found at a thrift shop in Washington, D.C. ''Five dollars,'' he whispered. ''So happy to have a Hiroshige, they are very famous.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Potter rolled her eyes. ''No, they're not,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oh, dear,'' she added. ''Everything looks rather tatty, because it is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tatty, sure. But the Sevres china on a shelf came from Versailles, by way of Pauline de Rothschild, a cousin of Mr. Potter's. This kind of tatty can burnish a whole house, even a developer's special. Assembling old-money objects to provide ballast for new money is a time-tested formula; it's the look that made Ralph Lauren a billionaire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You imagine that you, too, could live like a pasha here, never mind that the furniture is not for sale and that the flowers in the deceptively offhand arrangements tucked into silver christening cups weren't picked in the garden (there is no garden), but chosen by Ms. Potter and ordered from Fischer &amp; Page, a flower wholesaler on 28th Street in Manhattan who sends grape hyacinth and ranunculus by <span class="companylink">FedEx</span>. (Ms. Potter spent a few years in the 1980s doing the flowers for Pino Luongo's restaurants.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bohicket house was built on property bought by developers at the height of the real estate boom, said Debbie Fisher, owner of Handsome Properties, and the third agent to have the listing. And it hasn't been easy to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a great property,'' she said. ''Because it's on deep water on the Bohicket River. But the house was hard to wrap your head around.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ms. Fisher got the listing, she dropped the price by $100,000, and brought in the Potters, whom she knew by reputation. ''Having them there makes it not seem like a desperate sale,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS Tom Scheerer, a Manhattan decorator who spent six years in Charleston, noted, ''One of the obvious ironies is that no one will ever live as well in these houses as Sheila and Peter do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''I have a vision of Peter in a French striped-sailor shirt, cigarette dangling, buttering Sheila's toast, Gerald Murphy without the paint box and the dual trust funds.'' (In fact, the Potters no longer smoke. It's bad for business.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Potter grew up on Sutton Place, in Connecticut and on a thoroughbred farm in County Kildare, Ireland. Her godmother was Sybil Connolly, the Irish designer who dressed Jackie Kennedy (Ms. Potter has six of Ms. Connolly's dresses, though she said she doesn't have much occasion to wear them).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Potter, the child of foreign service officers, was born in Norway and raised all over the world: Washington; Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two met in Manhattan in the 1980s, Whit Stillman's Manhattan, where young women like Ms. Potter wore mink coats to Upper East Side clubs like the Zulu Lounge and Private's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The doormen called her a 'minkie,' '' Mr. Potter said. He was a D.J. and a manager at these places and others (Nell's, the Tunnel), a haughty aristocrat who made deft mixes and kept a young Madonna, who plied him with her EPs, at bay. ''The only song I liked from that untalented woman was 'Holiday,' '' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Potter made decalcomania lamps, glass fixtures collaged on the inside with cutouts from botanical and other prints, which she sold to socialites like Mercedes Bass and decorators like Sister Parish. She also took photographs, 35-millimeter black-and-white prints of street scenes in New York and Ireland, and women preening in the bathrooms of clubs. (Mr. Potter showed the reporter one example, a model in high-1980s fashion on a Manhattan street, but Ms. Potter quickly snatched it away, glaring at her husband. She is shy about this work; he thinks it's terrific.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the '90s rolled around, Manhattan was not as much fun as it had been, they said, and the Potters moved to Litchfield, Conn., first to a house of their own, and then, when their savings ran low, to a house that Ms. Potter's father owned and wanted to sell. ''We moved all our furniture in, and it sold in three months,'' Ms. Potter said. ''Our first staging job.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charleston was easier on the pocketbook, though, and warmer, than Connecticut. And the Potters already had friends there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Charleston is a house town, the purchase and gussying up of its trophy properties -- the huge antebellum confections, the clapboard ''single houses'' with their side piazzas, the sherbet-colored stuccos on Rainbow Row -- is a hobby for its residents, many of whom are part-timers. These houses define Charleston's social life, attracting people who collect real estate (rich people, mostly, looking for second or third homes), but also those in the creative classes. Mr. Scheerer bought a house on impulse during a two-hour visit there with a client.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and the Potters, who have friends in common, arrived around the same time. ''It's a cheap place to live,'' Mr. Scheerer said. ''And when we got there, it was just starting to burgeon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Potters moved into a $500-a-month, one-room rental on Rainbow Row, and did it up, Potter-style, with Mr. Scheerer's help. When a larger apartment upstairs became vacant, they moved in and did that up, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight months later, the building was converted to condominiums, but another opportunity presented itself: a friend who was getting divorced asked the Potters to move into her empty house. When it sold nine months later, they realized they had stumbled into a career. A condo in a developer's ''town home'' that the Potters staged next sold so quickly -- in four months -- that the developer moved them into the mirror image apartment across the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst house they ever staged was also the one they spent the least amount of time in: just 10 days. It was a Charleston ''single house,'' a clapboard structure one-room deep on the street side, that a local rock band had been living in. There was gum embedded in the pine floors, which were strewn with beer bottles and condoms. The owner had somehow forgotten to clean the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But we'd already said 'yes,' '' Ms. Potter explained. ''And our word is our word.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had just hung up the last picture,'' Mr. Potter said, when a couple from England offered all cash for the place, perhaps because the Potters' furniture was so familiar to them. An 18th-century Irish hunt table that had belonged to Ms. Potter's family (it's here on Bohicket Road, behind Ms. Potter's mother's sofa) was the twin of a table they had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These coincidences do occur. In the Greek revival house, a potential buyer recognized his brother in a photo of Mr. Potter's grammar school football team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Potters are between houses -- this happens -- they stay at a place that belongs to a friend (Melinda Mitchell, a local real estate agent, who owns a number of rental properties). ''When the clock is ticking,'' Ms. Potter said, ''she takes care of us.'' Their things are stored in three 10-by-20-foot storage units. This house, which they moved into with 300 boxes, used up the contents of two of those units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It takes them about two weeks to decorate a house, and they always do their bedroom first. They don't sketch out the rooms beforehand. They place the furniture by eye, and quickly. They can fill a house, mentally, on the first walk-through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's definitely an old-money look, that's for sure,'' Mr. Scheerer said. ''There are travel references, the Chinese furniture from his father's tour of duty. The furniture is very polished because Peter is a chronic furniture polisher. Sheila is an inveterate thrifter, and she's been able to add to the look. She's also fantastic with flowers, one of the best.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Potters are a paradox, moored down by their stuff, but floating free in an accidental career. Wouldn't they like to settle down?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Potter grinned. ''Yeah, in a way, it would be lovely to own your own house, and pay taxes and insurance,'' he said. ''Buy a shotgun.'' (Mr. Potter has a strong libertarian streak.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How long does it take for a new house to feel like a home?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Potter answered this one: ''It always does, immediately, because it's always our stuff,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's sort of horrible, being a collector,'' Mr. Potter said. ''I guess because you don't own your things, they own you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But unlike most collectors, you remind him, he is able to put his things to work. In a guest bedroom at the Bohicket house, four swoops of slightly frayed silk damask that hang over the windows amp up the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We just happened to have four,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes we forget what we have,'' Ms. Potter added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the dining room are a pair of intricate 18th-century thread ''paintings,'' and upstairs, a ''million-dollar'' Boston banjo clock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not worth a million dollars,'' Ms. Potter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What would the Potters do with a million dollars?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buy a little apartment in New York,'' Mr. Potter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Travel,'' Ms. Potter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three weeks ago, they heard from Ms. Fisher. ''I have bad news,'' she said. An offer had come in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But that's good news,'' Ms. Potter replied. ''We sold a house in five-and-a-half months. I've started packing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That takes longer than moving in, she said. At least three weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there a soundtrack for that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is,'' she said. ''Bubble wrap and James Brown. You know the one, 'Get Up Offa That Thing'?''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First of all, Justin's fine.Just fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president names Alan Krueger the new head of his Council of Economic Advisers. Brian Proffitt says he may be good for small businesses. The American Small Business League writes him an open letter. Jared Bernstein likes him, too (but then again he thinks the stimulus worked). Many expect Mr. Krueger to push for more stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Plumer say it's not too late to do nothing. Brad DeLong argues for keeping spending low. John Steele Gordon gives us a short primer on the national debt that concludes: "If the country can experience G.D.P. growth equal to what we had in the 1990s, the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio would drop, in just a decade, to 56.7 percent, about where it was in 2000." The Economist Mom wants the "super" committee to raise taxes. Ramesh Ponnuru wants to lower them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate stays the same as the government reports no new jobs were created. But A.D.P. says 91,000 jobs were reped in August. But small-business hiring slowed in August. And employees worked fewer hours and received less money. Consumer spending and income jumped in July. But consumer confidence fell to a two-year low. Home prices continued their double dip. But bank lending increased. Pending home sales slipped in July but are up sharply from a year ago. Texas manufacturing activity was unchanged in August. Ford's sales rose 11 percent. Hurricane Irene could cost insurers up to $3 billion (and washed up a monster!).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brett Arends says American companies are now more leveraged than at any time since the Great Depression - and then gives us 10 reasons to be optimistic. Small businesses may be rebounding, according to one survey. Retail employment rises in two-thirds of metropolitan areas. Brian Wesbury says stocks are undervalued (pdf) by 65 percent.

The American paper-clip market is huge. And here's the very best news of all!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new report finds that the No. 1 reason start-ups fail is because they scale prematurely. Baby boomers account for 84 percent of new businesses, and one of them decides to scrap retirement for the start-up life. Start-up activity among unemployed managers and executives in the first half of 2011 fell to its lowest level on record. More than one million self-employed Americans are no longer in business almost four years after the last recession began. Ryan O'Reilly says the start-up visa could help. A start-up automates the process of starting up. Monica Rogati sequences the DNA of a start-up. <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> hosts a mega start-up event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House majority leader, Eric Cantor, lays out his party's antitax and antiregulation agenda for the fall. Or was that Barack Obama's agenda? Representative Sam Graves says the White House regulatory review is "appreciated, but doesn't go far enough." Hayden Murray says the E.P.A. chokes business. But not all small businesses believe they are over-regulated and over-taxed. Megan McArdle writes about the death of a D.C. tavern: "Punishing a restaurant owner for a liquor license violation with an open-ended maybe-we'll-give-you-a-license-maybe-we-won't repay is equivalent to giving someone the death penalty for a parking violation. Moreover, it punishes the neighbors and the employees right along with the owner." Scammers are posing as FEMA reps. James W. Lucas reminds us that "the Federal Register for 2010 is over 81,000 pages long, a 19 percent increase in one year." California legislators take aim at baby sitters.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every detail of 5 Franklin Place was mapped out: Bosch washers and dryers, cantilevered staircases wrapping around cylindrical glass elevators and a facade with reflective black metal bands that would twist like ribbons and, just maybe, make Frank Gehry squirm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the condominium planned for TriBeCa with the dizzyingly ambitious vision of a small development firm, and an exotic design by the Dutch architect Ben van Berkel, may stand out as one of the worst casualties of the city's banking and housing crises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many new developments, of course, were stalled or thwarted by the economy's tumble, but the mortgage note on the condo project, which was to have risen 20 stories and contained 55 luxury apartments, has been sold twice. Now a foreclosure auction for the property, with a $47.04 million lien on it, is scheduled for Sept. 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minimum bid on the TriBeCa property must be higher than the lien, which includes the $28.25 million the developers originally borrowed to finance the project, as well as the interest rates, penalties and fees that piled up after they defaulted on the mortgage, according to Calin Onet, a marketing analyst for PropertyShark, which produced a detailed report on the project's financial history. If no one bids that high - or bids at all - the real estate investment firm that acquired the mortgage note on the property for about $48 million last December, Glacier Global Partners, will obtain ownership, Mr. Onet said. The firm cannot proceed with development plans unless it officially owns the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yaniv Blumenfeld, the chief executive of Glacier Global Partners, declined to comment, saying he did not want to discuss possible plans for the project until after the auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The travails of 5 Franklin Place began when Sleepy Hudson, a development firm that had specialized in small-scale projects like modest conversions and brownstone rehabilitations, bought the site, which has frontage on Broadway, for $36.6 million in 2006, property records show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm had done well in developing a 12-story condo, High Line 519 on West 23rd Street, which was completed in 2007 at the height of the real estate market. The developers had built in West Chelsea before many others marched in - and even before plans for the High Line were firm - so they had hoped to repeat the strategy with a bigger condo on the up-and-coming eastern edges of TriBeCa, they said. In the heady days of the boom, a 20-story luxury condo, with prices ranging from $2 million one-bedrooms to $16 million penthouses, seemed like a sure thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After buying the property Sleepy Hudson moved quickly: construction began in early 2007; the condo offering plan was approved by the state; a showroom opened on Harrison Street; apartments went on the market in the spring of 2008; and contracts were signed on eight units, including a $16 million penthouse, the developers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leo Tsimmer, a co-founder of Sleepy Hudson, had commissioned Mr. van Berkel to design a country house in the Catskills. He and his partner, David Kislin, then brought the architect into the Franklin Place project. In the design, Mr. van Berkel would ''pay homage to TriBeCa's iconic cast-iron aesthetic without compromising his passion for radical design,'' according a description of the condo prepared for the sales team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by the time the apartments hit the market, the developers had already defaulted on their mortgage, as they struggled to secure financing in the wake of the subprime mortgage meltdown and the collapse of <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their lender, Canyon Capital Realty Advisors, had assured them of additional loans that would finance the construction, Mr. Kislin said. After the <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> debacle, there were ''two weeks of radio silence,'' before the lender told the developers there would be no new loan, and they were then turned down elsewhere, Mr. Kislin recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They halted construction after building 5 of 20 floors, returning deposits to the eight buyers who had signed contracts. The bare bones of a partly built condo shrouded in scaffolding with boarded-up windows, the property bears little resemblance to the architectural renderings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the world were different,'' Mr. Tsimmer said, ''I think the city would have appreciated this property being built. I think residents would have viewed it as a great addition to their neighborhood. The prices were great, and we felt it was going to be a very beautiful project.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARIETTA HILL lives in a luxurious studio in one of Manhattan's newest rental high-rises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building has a top-of-the-line fitness center and a lap pool in a pristine white-tiled atrium, and a yoga room with bamboo floors. The children have a playroom, and so do the adults -- a sleek lounge. A media room is outfitted with a 110-inch screen and plush white leather chairs. The apartments have high-end finishes in the kitchens and bathrooms, and two things every renter covets: ample closet space and a washer/dryer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hill, an orthodontic assistant, pays about $500 a month, even though the starting market-rate rent for a studio in her building is $2,950.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For her, luxury housing is also affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, when a developer of market-rate residential buildings included affordable housing in exchange for tax incentives, the affordable units were often put in another complex or even in another borough altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, however, a change in city regulations made it almost impossible for developers to sequester the affordable units away from luxury digs. And as apartment buildings become ever more extravagant, the diversity within the walls of a single structure can be striking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hill's building, the Emerald Green, at 320 West 38th Street, is one of dozens to go up under a program known as 80/20 in the last few years, in which people from both extremes of the income scale live across the hall from one another. These projects include Tribeca Green downtown, MiMA and Silver Towers on West 42nd Street, and the Legacy on the Upper East Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ingrid Gould Ellen, a director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University, said that although it was unusual to have someone making $30,000 a year next door to a person making $500,000, it reflected a significant change in thinking about how to approach affordable housing. ''Over the past two decades,'' she said, ''there has been a movement around the country to have more income mix within neighborhoods.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in Manhattan, it is not just neighborhoods that are mixed, but the buildings themselves. In order to qualify for the program, developers must spread the affordable units throughout the building so as not to segregate low-income renters. To help ensure that the affordable units blend in, regulations cover everything from appliance sizes and access to common space, to an equitable distribution of views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Jacob, an executive vice president of Glenwood Management, the developer behind Emerald Green and one of the largest builders in Manhattan, says the effect is to make it difficult to tell who is paying market rate and who is not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We find that there is a very good social and economic mix,'' he said. ''If you are standing in the lobby watching people come in and out, I would challenge you to tell who is who. The affordable tenants are wonderful. To them, they have won the lottery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that does not mean developers leave anything to chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to meeting very strict financial criteria, which usually means making about $20,000 to $40,000 a year, applicants often have to provide references and credit histories; they are even subject to home visits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The screening is often far more rigorous than the market-rate tenants undergo, and competition is fierce, with as many as 10,000 applications pouring in for every 100 available apartments, according to city officials. Some 60 percent of those applicants fail to qualify from the outset. Information about upcoming affordable-housing lotteries can be found on the Web site of the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hill said that after the developers accepted her application in June 2010, they immediately scheduled a home interview. At the time, she was living with her aunt and sleeping on the couch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They asked everything,'' she recalled. ''Where do you work? What do you do? Why are you leaving your family?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the seven years she had lived in New York since moving from the Dominican Republic, she had bounced between the apartments of friends and relatives and had all but given up hope of finding an affordable home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you don't make a lot of money and you get a chance to live in a place like this you feel so blessed,'' she said. ''Programs like this, for people of low income, you give people energy to live.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Emerald Green, market-rate tenants are charged $350 a year to use the amenities. Those in affordable housing pay about half that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emerald Green was built under the auspices of 80/20 -- through which 80 percent of the apartments are rented for market-rate prices and then are subject to rent stabilization guidelines, and 20 percent are reserved for those making less than 50 percent of the area's median income, which varies by location and family size, but is in the ballpark of $80,000. More than 20,000 rental apartments have been built under this program over the years, 4,200 of them reserved for affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dozen city, state and federal programs subsidize housing, and the 80/20 program accounts for only a fraction of all affordable housing. The Bloomberg administration set a goal of creating 165,000 affordable units across the city and so far has created about 125,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, in Manhattan, the 80/20 program plays a significant role in the overall rental market since developers say that without the incentives it affords, it would be all but impossible to build new large-scale rental buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do not believe you can build a 100 percent rental building in Manhattan where you do not do an 80/20,'' Mr. Jacob said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make these projects work, developers say, the market-rate rentals have to command top dollar from the day the doors open. Although 80 percent of the apartments can be priced at the upper limits of what developers think the market will bear, they then automatically come under the rent-stabilization system, limiting how much rents can rise each year afterward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So even though many New Yorkers shake their heads in bewilderment when they see one-bedroom apartments going for $4,000 a month, the reality is that, over time, those apartments may be considered deals, since the rents will rise very slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These programs took shape during a dark period in the city's history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the depths of a recession in the 1970s, developers were given tax abatements to promote construction under a program known as 421-a. To encourage building in forlorn parts of the city, developers were offered a tax abatement allowing them to pay real estate taxes on the assessed value of the land before construction. For instance, if the property was worth $1 million unbuilt, but the new building increased the value to $10 million, they would pay taxes -- for 10 to 25 years, depending on the project -- on only the $1 million. Affordable housing did not have to be provided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as land in Manhattan between 14th and 96th Streets was extremely valuable even then, it was designated an excluded zone. One of the few ways that developers could get the 421-a tax abatement was to build affordable housing, the most common being 80/20 projects. Where the 421-a program can save millions in taxes for the length it is applied (usually 20 years in Manhattan), the 80/20 program allows developers to borrow money at extremely low rates, similar to those paid by the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, however, developers did not have to build the affordable units in the same building as the luxury rentals. Instead, they could buy certificates that they could then use to build the affordable housing components elsewhere, often in the outer boroughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the building boom of the last decade, the system came under increasing fire as being too generous to developers. In 2008, the program was revised so that all of Manhattan and parts of the Brooklyn and Queens waterfront became excluded zones, meaning that to get the 421-a tax abatement, developers would have to build affordable housing -- 80/20 or some other variant -- in parts of the city where it had not been the norm. And since the certificate system was done away with, those affordable units usually had to be built in the same building as the luxury rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after the changes were implemented, however, the market collapsed and development stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, development is again picking up and the impact of the rule changes is just beginning to be felt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, says at least six 80/20 projects are being planned in Manhattan. They will add some 1,500 affordable and rent-stabilized apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the 80/20 program has proved successful in prime Manhattan neighborhoods, he said, it remains to be seen if neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn can command the kinds of rents that make such development feasible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Levine, the president of Levine Builders, said that the rule changes were already having an impact in an economy still very unfavorable to financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can see it in the outer boroughs, where there is little new construction planned,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While building affordable housing in expensive neighborhoods may have societal benefits, he said, it often does not make economic sense since it can cost three times more and provides fewer apartments than a traditional midrise dedicated to affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heart of the problem, he said, is a system that places too much of the tax burden on new construction in order to keep property taxes on older buildings low. Without the 421-a abatement, he said, it is difficult to turn a profit on new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subsidizing of 80/20 projects also raises questions about how best to spread government subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the lucky few who can score one of these apartments, it is a great deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it best serves extremes of the spectrum -- the working poor and the affluent -- while leaving broad swaths of the middle class priced out of the Manhattan apartment market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are building the luxury stuff for wealthy people and we are throwing in low-income housing,'' Mr. Spinola said, ''but nobody is building for the nurse who is married to a cop.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is trying to address that concern in several ways; one is to require developers who are building on land bought from the city to have a broader array of mixed-income housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, the Bloomberg administration recently announced an agreement with a developer to build Studio City, a new 1,238-unit rental building between 44th and 45th Streets along 11th Avenue, that will include units for people in three different categories: those who make 50 percent of the average area income, those who make 135 percent, and those who make 165 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, given the cost of construction in Manhattan, said Ms. Ellen of N.Y.U., the challenge is daunting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How much are we willing to pay to create diversity?'' she said. ''When you have a lot of need, should you put all the resources on serving the very neediest? Or should you have a broader approach, one that includes the upper middle class? It is something the city has been trying to balance.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Victoria Theater on 125th Street in Harlem has been home to vaudeville shows, Off Broadway productions and Hollywood movies. But its terra cotta facade has been mostly dark since 1989 when, after failing as a five-screen multiplex, it shut its doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the Empire State Development Corporation, which owns the land, has been trying to redevelop the site. In 2005, it began a process to turn the Victoria into a mixed-use hotel, condominium and arts complex, and in 2007, after several fits and starts, it chose Danforth Development Partners to spearhead the project. But the collapse of the real estate market put those plans on a shelf, and the site has remained undeveloped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, Danforth found a new equity partner, Exact Capital, and it now says the $100 million project is back on track and will break ground in the second half of next year. While not completed, the current design, by Aufgang &amp; Subotovsky Architecture and Planning, calls for two towers to rise above the theater: a 140-unit rental building and a separate 175-room hotel. The base will consist of the historic building, built in 1917 to a design by Thomas W. Lamb, and will become the new home of the Classical Theater of Harlem, Jazzmobile, the Harlem Arts Alliance and the Apollo Theater Foundation. The developers are planning to present the final design to the Harlem Community Development Corporation, a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation, this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Victoria Theater is the latest in a string of redevelopment projects along 125th Street. In 2008, the city rezoned the street with a goal of replacing the many small-scale buildings along it with office towers, residential high-rises and cultural institutions. But the rezoning was approved just as the real estate market collapsed, and many of the developments did not get off the ground. Now, several are starting up again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we received the designation for the project, that was the beginning of the slide in the real estate market,'' said M. Steven C. Williams, the president and chief of Danforth, ''but now, people have a clearer picture, hotel financing is coming back and the project is financeable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The theater's facade will be preserved, as will several historic elements including gilded chandeliers, a fountain and a grand staircase. While the cultural center's plans are not complete, it now calls for two performance spaces: a 199-seat theater and a 99-seat theater in which seats can be removed to create a multitude of configurations. In addition, the four-story theater building will house a scenery shop, costume shop, administrative offices, dressing rooms and a gallery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There will be no wasted space, since it is being custom-built, and we are taking advantage of economies of scale, such as shared restrooms, dressing rooms and a single receptionist,'' said Jonathan Denham, a principal at the real estate company Denham Wolf, which is advising the cultural groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residential component of the Victoria Theater project will have a full-service rental building that is expected to be 50 percent market-rate apartments, 30 percent reserved for middle-income tenants and 20 percent for low-income ones, said Craig Livingston, a managing partner at Exact Capital. The developers are negotiating with several companies to run the hotel and hope to strike a deal this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All the major hotel chains have expressed very serious interest in the project -- even Starwood, which opened an Aloft hotel on Eighth Avenue but is considering another Starwood brand there,'' said Curtis L. Archer, the president of the Harlem Community Development Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other projects planned for 125th Street include Mart 125, across the street from the Victoria Theater. The mixed-use project will create up to 67,000 square feet of cultural and commercial space. It will also be home to the National Jazz Museum in Harlem, which produces jazz events and education series, and ImageNation Sol Cinema, which runs an independent film festival. In May 2010, the city, which owns the site, put out a request for proposals, and hopes to pick a developer ''in the coming months,'' said Seth W. Pinsky, the president of the <span class="companylink">New York City Economic Development Corporation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these projects have been in the works for years, ''I believe Mart 125 will happen soon and same with the Victoria Theater,'' said Paul Wolf, a principal at Denham Wolf, which also represents the National Jazz Museum at Mart 125. ''Soon in Manhattan timing, so not 60 days, but not years either. I believe these projects are really going to happen now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the city picked developers to re-imagine two other sites on 125th Street: the former Taystee Bakery complex and the Corn Exchange Building. The Taystee Bakery had been awarded to an affiliate of the <span class="companylink">Citarella</span> food markets in 2001 but after it sat undeveloped for years, the New York State Supreme Court awarded it back to the city in 2009. The case is in litigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current plan for the Taystee Bakery is reinvent it as Create @ Harlem Green, a $100 million development that will include 90,000 square feet of office space, 40,000 square feet of retail and a 10,000-square-foot community facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several tenants are already lined up, including the Harlem Brewing Company and the Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $16 million Corn Exchange project will renovate the late 19th-century building at 125th Street and Park Avenue and add six stories to create 22,000 square feet for offices and 9,000 square feet for retail stores. The city hopes the project will break ground within a year, Mr. Pinsky said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fifth project is the East Harlem Media, Entertainment and Cultural Center. A $700 million endeavor, it is planned to eventually include a hotel, 250,000 square feet of office space and more than 800 units of housing, but the first phase, expected to be completed later this fall, is far more modest. It will establish 49 units of affordable housing and 5,600 square feet of retail space. The second phase, to be started sometime next year, will create just under 100 residential units and 50,000 square feet of retail space.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EAST NORTHPORT, N.Y. -- When the housing market collapsed in 2008, construction of retirement and assisted-living housing ground to a halt, just as it did in most commercial real estate sectors, as access to capital evaporated. But a few companies kept their development teams intact in the recession, and are now building new facilities and expanding their operations. And as lending loosens, they say, they are poised to benefit from the housing needs of America's aging population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers who have grown in these lean years tend to be small to midsize regional operations that know their local markets well, had a strong portfolio before the crash and have been able to persuade banks to lend despite the dour economy. They also tend to invest in assisted-living rental properties, which are tied to health care rather than personal housing choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's certainly not for everyone, but there are companies that really understand the markets and submarkets, and they're very adept at building,'' said David S. Schless, president of American Seniors Housing Association, an industry trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for nursing homes, assisted-living facilities and retirement communities is expected to balloon in the next two decades as baby boomers retire and the incidence of progressive illnesses like Alzheimer's disease increases. The number of Americans over the age of 65 is expected to double to 71 million by 2030, and 7.7 million of them will suffer from Alzheimer's disease, a 50 percent increase from today, according to the Alzheimer's Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a great time to develop senior housing,'' said Marilynn K. Duker, the president of Brightview Senior Living, a developer based in Maryland that has completed five new facilities since 2008 and has three others under construction. ''As long as we can continue to get capital and have the ability to afford it, it's an opportunity and there isn't a lot of competition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of housing for older people has not been keeping pace with demographics, especially in regions like the New York metro area. New York has the fewest number of such units, including retirement communities and assisted-living facilities, available relative to the number of households with residents over the age of 75 of all the top metro markets in the country, according to the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing and Care Industry, an industry research group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of the housing boom, there was a nationwide surplus of retirement and assisted-living housing, but with construction bottoming out, demand is now outstripping supply. New construction starts in such housing have dropped by 53 percent since the crash and now make up just over 1 percent annually of the senior housing inventory, according to the National Investment Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is pretty much an all-time low,'' said Jerry L. Doctrow, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Stifel Nicolaus</span>. ''There's not much coming in the pipeline at all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in East Northport, a town on Long Island, a 100-bed assisted-living facility developed by the Engel Burman Group that opened in March is already 50 percent full. With a lush, landscaped circular driveway, the $35 million property, called the Bristal at East Northport, resembles an upscale hotel in some ways. The lobby has a concierge and a fireplace, and opens onto a dining room with linen-covered tables. The three-story building provides residents with a library, a swimming pool, a small putting green and a billiard room. Room costs range from $3,400 a month for a shared suite to $6,000 a month for a room in the 32-bed dementia ward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the seventh Bristal on Long Island built by Engel Burman, and the first since 2007, when the company sold its other Bristal properties for $320 million to <span class="companylink">Chartwell Seniors Housing REIT</span>, of Canada, and another real estate investment trust owned by ING Real Estate Australia. A noncompete agreement expired in February, allowing Engel Burman to open the doors at the East Northport facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engel Burman has several other projects under way, including the Seasons, a $150 million, 404-unit retirement community 30 minutes away in East Meadow that was financed in late 2007 before the housing market crash. At prices starting at $389,000 for a two-bedroom townhouse, all but five of the first 212 units built have been sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're from Long Island. We know the island. We know the locations. We are still very bullish on Long Island,'' said Steven Krieger, a co-founder and principal at Engel Burman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is building elsewhere in the region, as well. Four properties are under contract in New York and another in northern New Jersey. The company plans to develop new assisted-living facilities at all of them. Engel Burman financed the East Northport facility with industrial development agency tax-exempt bonds, an unusual choice in an industry that generally relies on bank lending. But the company has long relied on such bonds to finance their assisted-living facilities, and without them, Mr. Krieger said, the project might not have been built at all, because of the difficulty of securing a bank loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the market crashed, the company's bond buyer, Oppenheimer Funds, was still willing to work with them. But the rates were much higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial development agency bonds also come with strings attached. Engel Burman must set aside 20 percent of the units for low-income residents and 90 percent of the residents must have previously lived within a five-mile radius of the facility, or have an immediate family member who currently does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank financing may come with fewer restrictions, but getting it is no easy feat. In 2009, for example, Ms. Duker of Brightview spent nine months trying to finance a 180-unit retirement housing development in Marlton, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year earlier, she said, it would have taken her about three weeks to secure financing. But by 2009, her go-to bank was reluctant to invest in real estate. In the end, a small regional bank agreed to finance the $33 million development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The faltering economy changed the calculus for many older Americans. Fewer have moved into retirement communities, and many in need of assisted-living arrangements moved in with family, changes that badly bruised industry giants. One, <span class="companylink">Erickson Retirement Communities</span>, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2009 and was subsequently acquired at auction by Redwood Capital Investments. Sunrise Senior Living, another industry leader, shut down its development arm and sold some assets to manage its debts. ''Everything is much stricter than it ever used to be, and that makes it that much harder'' to build, said Wayne Kaplan, the president of Premier Senior Living, an owner and operator of properties in New York, Ohio and Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because assisted living is tied to health care, it is an attractive option for skittish banks just beginning to loosen their purse strings. Unlike hotels and residential high-rises, assisted-living facilities can attract government underwriting, which make them safer bets. And assisted-living property owners have a very low default rate: less than 1 percent, according to the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing and Care Industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That kind of financial performance gives banks confidence that senior housing is different from other sectors of the real estate sector,'' said William Pettit, president and chief of Merrill Gardens, a developer in Seattle that is opening a senior housing development in San Diego next month. ''There's a fundamental demand that has continued throughout the recession.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A five-story, 12,000-square-foot town house on the East Side, which sold for $23 million after more than two years of being on and off the market, was the highest sale of the week, according to city property records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller, Derek M. Quinlan, is an Irish real estate investor whose fortunes took a dive when the housing market crashed in 2008. As his debt climbed into the hundreds of millions of dollars, he was forced to sell off many assets, according to British newspaper accounts. A Scottish bank, one of his lenders, repossessed his 102-foot yacht, the newspapers reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, Mr. Quinlan paid $26.25 million for the 25-foot-wide town house, at 20 East 64th Street between Fifth and Madison, property records show. He listed the property, which has five bedrooms and seven and a half baths, for $37 million in the spring of 2009 with Prudential Douglas Elliman, which cut the price to $32 million before Mr. Quinlan took it off the market for nine months. He relisted it in June 2010 with Leslie J. Garfield for $29.5 million- and a year later, it sold for $3.25 million less than he had paid for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer was listed under a limited liability company.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far west suburban Yorkville scarcely looks as if it was once one of America's hottest boomtowns. In some subdivisions, lots for big homes are patches of scrub grass and rocky soil. Weeds crawl up around some curbs. A mere handful of houses dot the barren landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This was going to be the place to be,'' said Jay Waldvogel, a dentist who is one of the tiny number of residents in a lonesome neighborhood of Yorkville, the seat of Kendall County, about 50 miles southwest of the Loop. ''And now it's dead.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2000 and 2010, Kendall was the fastest-growing county in the United States, with a growth rate of some 110 percent, according to the Census Bureau. In the Chicago area, Kendall was not the only faraway land of big dreams. Population soared, too, in distant suburban Kane, Will and McHenry Counties. Even in DeKalb County, tall-corn country nearly halfway to Iowa, newcomers were drawn by visions of castles on a cul-de-sac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now real estate experts say these far-flung housing developments are among the hardest hit by the housing downturn. In Yorkville, with a population of about 18,000, at least 10 subdivisions sit unfinished, with little sign of development soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Chicago region has been one of the hardest-hit markets in the country,'' said Erik Doersching, the executive vice president of Tracy Cross &amp; Associates, a real estate analysis firm in Schaumburg. ''And the outlying areas are the most impacted.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009 and 2010, the top foreclosure rates in Illinois were in Kendall, Kane and Will Counties. On the new suburban frontier along the farthest fringes of the Chicago region, where cheap land and rising prices once triggered a rush of buyers, some newer developments have become ghost towns in places like Yorkville, Frankfort, Sugar Grove and Hampshire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in exurban Sycamore, a 70-mile drive to downtown Chicago, the population roughly doubled, to some 17,000, in the 2000s. Those were heady times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were tripping over buyers,'' said Diane Hammon, the president of the DeKalb Area Association of Realtors, recalling the people eager to build homes in subdivisions carved out of farmland in Sycamore. ''We didn't take the time to stop and think, 'This could come down.' And then all of a sudden, we just fell off a cliff.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property values in Chicago and closer suburbs have also suffered. But the distant areas were more vulnerable, according to Prof. Thomas Lys, who teaches classes on the dynamics of the real estate market at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, because they were driven largely by speculation, as buyers bet on rampant growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When fuel prices jumped, the distant suburbs lost some appeal, Professor Lys said. ''With $4-a-gallon gas, you're just not going to want to drive 100 miles a day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sudden halt to building in the far suburbs has changed the way people define the contours of the Chicago region, said Mr. Doersching, the real estate analyst. Places that were verging on becoming part of the Chicago area, he said, have reverted to rural status and are likely to stay that way for at least another generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the distant town of Hampshire in far western Kane County, it seemed as if the metropolis had come knocking four or five years ago. A giant new residential project called Prairie Ridge announced a development of homes that would cover 1,300 acres of corn and bean fields with upscale homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a town where people can feel comfortable in overalls, the project promised Hampshire a loftier place in the world. In preparation for the expected rush of newcomers, Hampshire opened a gleaming three-story high school in 2007 that could accommodate a doubling of enrollment, to 2,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the housing market crashed even before Prairie Ridge started digging foundations. Today the would-be development has paved roads, street signs, fire hydrants, even rows of trees -- but only three houses, two of them model homes sold in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the expected influx of new students, Hampshire now has a much bigger high school than it needs, and 15 classrooms remain shuttered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It cost the community $185 million, most of it raised through a bond issue, to build Hampshire High School and upgrade other facilities to prepare for the growth that did not come. Besides paying those bills, the town has been forced to grapple with a shrinking tax base eroded by plummeting housing values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make ends meet, the school cut $8 million from its budget this year, the principal, Chuck Bumbales, said. The Hampshire teachers' union agreed to contract concessions, and administrators took a two-year pay freeze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In places where the boom has fizzled, most people seem certain that growth will come eventually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one sparse Yorkville subdivision, Whitetail Ridge, Mike Fuehrmeyer stepped outside to water his bushes. From his front yard he could spot about 10 ''For Sale'' signs on nearby lots and homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak of the housing boom in 2007, the subdivision had homes that carried asking prices of well over $1 million, said Mr. Fuehrmeyer, who bought four years ago. He would not reveal what he had paid but said a recent appraisal showed his property had lost 34 percent of its value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You just pray the values will go up,'' Mr. Fuehrmeyer said with a shrug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those who hope for a quick rebound may be disappointed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People think we'll see a recovery and prices will just go back up to where they were,'' Mr. Doersching said. ''That's not how it's going to work. If you have a house that used to be worth $300,000, and now it's worth $220,000, well, maybe in six years it'll be up to $240,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For bargain hunters, the downturn has meant that many recent home buyers can afford a much grander dwelling. Byron Patterson, a 42-year-old highway maintenance worker, moved from Bolingbrook to a stone-and-brick McMansion in Yorkville last November, paying $100,000 less than a list price that had already been discounted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It worked out cool for my family,'' Mr. Patterson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For people in economic distress, however, losing a house -- whether voluntarily or by foreclosure -- can be emotionally wrenching. It is painful under any circumstances, but in suburbs and small towns, where people tend to know other people's business, the wounds can be rubbed raw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I sit at closings with people who are absolutely crushed with embarrassment,'' said Ms. Hammon, the DeKalb real estate broker. ''And I tell them: 'Look, this isn't your fault. You got sick. Or you went through a divorce. Or you lost your job. You're not alone.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yorkville's superintendent of schools, Scott Wakeley, said educators and counselors needed to be especially attentive to children whose families were under financial pressure. It had been customary in his district for 3 to 5 percent of students to qualify for subsidized lunches, he said. Now that figure ''is in the double-digits.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a hidden emotional toll that family financial problems bear on the children,'' Dr. Wakeley said. ''We've got kids in our district who have done all the right things, gotten straight A's, scored a 29 or 30 on their ACT, and now they're being told they can't afford to go to that Big Ten school of their dreams. They're going to a community college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And we've got kids who used to play three sports, or kids who used to be involved in activities, like the band. And now they're not. They've got to work a job.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEFORE the financial markets' most recent drubbing, New York City's real estate prices had been flat for the better part of a year. But over the spring and summer, prices in certain pockets of property sprinkled around Manhattan and Brooklyn had rebounded to or beyond pre-recession levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These micromarkets could turn up along a particular avenue or even in a specific building, and they tended to be in what brokers describe as prime locations, in neighborhoods like Greenwich Village and Chelsea in Manhattan, and Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They fell into a few general categories, namely: apartments in move-in condition; family-size apartments with three or more bedrooms; apartments with unusual features like helicopter-level views of Central Park; and almost-new condos in their first resale. Having one of these traits did not guarantee a record-setting price, but apartments achieving that milestone tended to have one or more of them. The apartments often also generated multiple offers, though not quite the frenetic bidding wars that were routine in 2007 and 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest round of economic turmoil will no doubt give buyers pause and may portend a double dip for the real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Consumers are going to look at all this economic uncertainty and they're going to be more wary about buying,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and a market analyst for Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''It's going to delay the recovery, which was already challenged, and it will probably take the edge off some of the areas that have already seen improvement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite this, brokers say, the types of apartments that had been getting 2007 and 2008 prices will probably continue to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaun Osher, the chief executive of the agency CORE, said he had seen apartments in several developments that opened in 2008 and 2009 easily selling for more than the original owners paid. ''The product is the product,'' he said. ''Even if the markets decline, the units that will continue to fare the best are the resales in new developments.'' For some people, he added, ''the only thing better than buying a shiny new condo is buying one that is still pretty new but has already had any problems vetted out.'' He said the strong sales were helped by a lack of new inventory coming to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 520 West 19th Street in Chelsea, which CORE helped sell out in 2008, a three-bedroom apartment that closed in September 2008 for $2.675 million sold this June for $3.15 million, an increase of nearly 18 percent. Similarly, Streeteasy.com shows that a two-bedroom there resold in April for $2.3 million, 10 percent more than the $2.09 million the original owner paid. The bounce clearly had not yet hit last summer, when another three-bedroom sold for $2.3 million, 13 percent below its original $2.64 million sale price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success of 520 West 19th Street, of course, cannot be generalized for all two- to three-year-old buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Perlson, the chief executive of the brokerage RealDirect, said strong resales were ''not the rule for a lot of the developments that came on at the height of the market.'' In Chelsea, he said, some buildings near Eighth Avenue are reselling at a loss, while buildings farther west or farther east are getting a premium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are pockets of activity in West Chelsea near the High Line that are probably going to have success in whatever market we're in,'' Mr. Perlson said. Buildings along the Avenue of the Americas have also been selling well, he added, because ''this neighborhood has become much hotter in the last two years,'' with the opening of a <span class="companylink">Trader Joe's</span> and the Eataly food court not too far away. He said he had a buyer in contract for a two-bedroom at the Lion's Head Condominium, at Avenue of the Americas and 19th Street, for $2.15 million. The apartment originally sold in 2007 for $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the same avenue at the Chelsea Stratus, a 37-story tower at 24th Street that opened in mid-2007, at least eight apartments have resold this year with premiums of 2 to 21 percent, according to data from Streeteasy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Anderson, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman who led the sales team for the developer and has since resold dozens of units at the Stratus, said that after <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed in September 2008 , about 20 buyers pulled out of their contracts. Those units were resold at discounts of about 15 percent in 2009, he said, but prices started to bounce back in mid-2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that the Stratus, which towers above its neighbors, was selling well ''because it has something that you can't replicate,'' specifically stunning city views. ''The quality has to be there and the floor plans have to work,'' he said. ''But it's a building's uniqueness more than anything else that will get the prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, Chelsea condos, which are primarily in new developments, are selling better than co-ops. The median sales price for condos there has already exceeded the high of $1.49 million it reached in 2008, hitting $1.65 million in the second quarter of 2011, according to data compiled by Miller Samuel. The median price for co-ops, on the other hand, is lagging at $615,000 in the second quarter; the 2008 high was $784,052.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall market in Manhattan, however, shows the opposite trend, with co-ops faring better than condos, but both categories still down from the height.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Grossman, the executive director of downtown sales for Halstead Property, said prices had reached previous heights only ''for certain units in certain buildings.'' These tend to be renovated apartments in prime locations, he said. ''It's not happening if it's on the far East or far West Sides of town, or if it's far from a subway stop.'' Other real estate basics will also influence sales price, he added, citing an apartment's condition and whether ''it has something special about it -- view, light or something unusual.'' But when these apartments sell for high prices, other apartments in the same building are likely to appreciate as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What defines a building or an apartment as special can vary by neighborhood. In SoHo, where smaller buildings predominate, it could be a doorman or outdoor space. In Greenwich Village, where prewar buildings are common, it could be a signature building of midcentury design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two months ago Richard Orenstein, an executive vice president of Halstead, sold a two-bedroom loft at 72 Mercer Street in SoHo a week after listing it. The full-floor apartment had sold for $3 million in early 2008, and it resold at the full asking price of $3.995 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things in general take longer to sell now, but special apartments sell for special prices,'' Mr. Orenstein said. The SoHo condo stood out because it had a large terrace and also was in a doorman building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Greenwich Village in March, Sharon Held, a senior vice president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, sold a two-bedroom apartment at the Butterfield House for $1.426 million. The apartment was an estate sale and needed work, but it nonetheless drew five bids and sold for a hair above the $1.425 million asking price. The price works out to about $1,200 per square foot, which Ms. Held described as exceeding the $1,100 per square foot that was the norm in 2007 and 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Held said that interested buyers had been drawn by the building's design. Unlike most postwar buildings, Butterfield House has high ceilings and bay windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Upper West Side, said Jill Sloane, an executive vice president of Halstead, apartments near either Central Park or Riverside Park have been selling more quickly than others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She recently helped Diana Lochridge sign a contract to sell her one-bedroom floor-through apartment in a brownstone on West 103rd Street, off of Riverside Park. Ms. Lochridge, who is a vice president at the cable channel truTV, had listed the apartment with two different brokers last year, but there were no takers. She had dropped the price to $799,000 from $895,000 by the time she took it off the market in December and decided to renovate the kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was the only room that wasn't quite done,'' Ms. Lochridge said, ''and I wanted a new kitchen anyway.'' She spent about $16,000 to replace laminate counters and plywood cabinets and to install stainless-steel appliances. ''It was money well spent,'' she said. ''Because I think it sold the place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another broker interviewed by Ms. Lochridge suggested pricing the apartment at $700,000, even after the renovation, but Ms. Sloane put it on the market for $839,000 and it is now in contract for $830,000, a price she believes is close to market highs. She said Ms. Lochridge's apartment merited the high price because it has nearly 1,000 square feet and is now in turnkey condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marie Bianco, an agent at Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that she and some of her clients routinely used to buy and renovate apartments in the hopes of reselling them at a profit, but that the practice screeched to a halt in 2009. ''Nobody could make money back then,'' she said, ''so they just rented them out for another year.'' But investors started selling their properties again earlier this year as prices improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bianco said she listed her two-bedroom apartment at the City Spire, a 72-story tower built on West 56th Street in the 1980s, at the beginning of the year. There was little activity at first, but she sold the place earlier this month to Italian investors for $1.625 million. She bought it for $1.48 million in 2007 and had the kitchen renovated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn, Jim Cornell, a senior vice president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said he was surprised when he reviewed sales data for Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights and found that prices for larger apartments had already rebounded. Family-size apartments are very popular in these areas, especially among Manhattanites seeking more space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three-bedroom apartments in these neighborhoods sold for an average of $1.139 million in 2007, and dropped to $1.065 million in 2009. The average price to date for 2011 is $1.226 million, Mr. Cornell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When a seller comes to us,'' he added, ''they usually want to know if they can get as much as what their neighbor got when they sold in 2007. These numbers prove that the answer is yes, maybe even more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Paula Bordelois and her husband, Michael Kamal, bought a three-bedroom in an eight-year-old building in Park Slope a few months ago, they knew they ''weren't buying cheap,'' Ms. Bordelois said. Listed at $1.425 million, the apartment received five offers and sold for $1.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of our friends didn't think it was the best financial decision,'' Ms. Bordelois said. ''But this was exactly what we wanted, and we were thinking we would be here for the long term, so it was the right decision.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The duplex apartment is in an elevator building, and it has two terraces and a roof deck, none of which are easy to come by in brownstone Brooklyn, she said. And, because they had been renting an apartment just a few doors down, their 3-year-old daughter already had friends on the block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Gomes, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, described New York's real estate recovery as erratic. He said he had seen listings in TriBeCa languish with prices of $1,000 per square foot, while others asking $2,000 per square foot had sparked bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It all depends on the exact location and the exact product,'' Mr. Gomes said. This is why he advises customers ''to buy something special -- get the corner apartment, get the extra bedroom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even now, in this newly uncertain market, he said, ''if you make a smart choice and don't buy the thing that anyone can buy, you'll weather the storm.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MORRISTOWN, N.J. -- Jordan Eppolito has taken a liking to his new home here in the Morris County seat, about 30 miles west of New York City. Mr. Eppolito, a 28-year-old entrepreneur who plans to open a pizza shop this fall on South Street, lives in a new condominium overlooking the Morristown Green, the historic park at the center of town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an urban style of living -- Mr. Eppolito can walk to two coffee shops for his morning brew -- that he compares to Manhattan or Hoboken. His condominium, called 40 Park, is part of a burst of development and redevelopment that has brought more than 500 new residential units to Morristown in the last three years, attracted young professionals and well-to-do baby boomers, and ignited interest in the town of about 19,000, said Mayor Timothy Dougherty, who was elected in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're very fortunate in this economy that people still want to come here and invest,'' said Mr. Dougherty, 52, who is the chief engineer at the Prudential Center in Newark. ''We have a huge younger population moving in. I have people every day wanting to meet in my office and wanting to talk about different ideas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the town is hoping the recent residential growth around the Green and the train station will carry over to Speedwell Avenue, where a mixed-use project that would displace small businesses and a number of 19th-century homes in a largely Latino neighborhood has met with a less-than-ecstatic reception.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, Morristown seems to be doing relatively well in the economic downturn. Of approximately one million square feet of ground floor retail space available in Morristown, just 4 percent is vacant, according to estimates from Jennifer Wehring, the director of marketing for the Morristown Partnership, which oversees a special improvement district formed in 1995 when big retailers like Woolworth's and <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> were closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent privately financed residential projects include 217 one- and two-bedroom rental apartments at the Highlands at Morristown Station, billed as a ''transit village''; 36 luxury condominiums at the Vail Mansion on South Street, a main artery leading to the Green; 78 luxury condos and penthouses at 40 Park, a property overlooking the Green; and the Metropolitan, 130 apartments with upscale amenities behind 40 Park, connected by a brick plaza. The 40 Park project replaced Epstein's, a landmark department store on the Green for nearly a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra Tantleff, vice president for development of the Roseland Property Company, a developer that has invested more than $250 million in new construction in the town in less than a decade, said there was a huge appetite for new residential units. ''People want out of Jersey City, Hoboken and Manhattan,'' she said. ''The pitch we are selling is the lifestyle in Morristown.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the lures are nearly 100 restaurants within walking distance of the Green; the Midtown Direct, a <span class="companylink">New Jersey Transit</span> rail link into Manhattan; and a history that includes George Washington, who drilled his troops on the Green in 1777.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Speedwell Avenue project, in the works since 2004, is planned to have 800 residential units in low-rise buildings on 11 acres, with 65,000 to 85,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space. It will be built in four phases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first phase is to include 268 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments with underground parking on 2.3 acres, but the project has stalled because of the recession and haggling over the percentage of affordable apartments, a figure that went from 20 percent in the euphoric period before the crash to a more economically manageable 10 percent, Mr. Dougherty said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phase II, on a site adjacent to the first, has been designed on about 3.5 acres to include two apartment buildings with up to 200 rental apartments, a two-acre ''mini Green'' and 14 town house units, although the exact mix has not been decided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer of the first two phases, Richard Murphy of Mill Creek Residential Trust, has proposed a plan for Phase I estimated to cost $50 million that calls for tearing down the town's Department of Public Works building and several 19th-century homes and paving a road, but it contains no retail space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mill Creek Residential Trust is a spinoff of <span class="companylink">Trammell Crow Residential</span>, the original developer of the project; Mr. Murphy is a former Trammell Crow executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No question that the ability to finance new retail is very, very difficult right now,'' Mr. Murphy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tantleff of Roseland said that despite the low vacancy rate in the downtown area, where retail rents range from $20 to $45 per square foot, the company had not filled any of the 8,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space at the Highlands near the train station and had not leased all the retail at 40 Park. Along Park Avenue, 17,000 of the 25,000 available square feet that Roseland controls has been leased, to <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span>, Roots Steakhouse, Urban Table, Qdoba and <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company still has 25,000 square feet available below ground and 11,000 square feet along Market Street, a side street off the Green. Rents for the new space are from $40 to $55 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nobody has come to us and said, 'Can we please build retail?' '' said Phil Abramson of the Jonathan Rose Companies, which is the town planner. ''We have developers coming to us all the time,'' who want to build ''20 units, 100 units'' of housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Speedwell Avenue, retail is strong, and that has fueled some of the resistance to the project. Just past the 14-story Headquarters Plaza, a 700,000-square-foot Class A office complex with four black glass towers -- Mr. Abramson described it as ''a very oppressive building; people cross the street not to walk under it'' -- is a thriving, mostly Latino community where one- and two-story buildings offer low rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a flourishing commercial area,'' said Marion Harris, a former chairwoman of the Morristown Historic Preservation Commission, who has been objecting to the proposed redevelopment there for years. ''It's just not trendy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Harris and the current chairman, Kenneth Miller, were instrumental in getting Preservation New Jersey, a nonprofit group, to designate the area around the Speedwell redevelopment plan as one of the state's 10 most endangered historic places in 2008, a purely symbolic distinction but one that draws attention to the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The new plan is better than the old plan,'' said Mr. Miller, a retired New York banker who lives in a historic house in town. ''Affordable retail is what Speedwell has been for more than 100 years, a transitional neighborhood. It's been sort of the melting pot of Morristown and Morris County. Ma-and-pa-type businesses simply cannot afford new construction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest plans for Phases I and II, designed by Dean Marchetto, an architect in Hoboken, tries to borrow from the existing architecture by turning the original plan ''inside out,'' according to Mr. Marchetto, Mr. Murphy and others involved in the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was 'Anywhere, New Jersey' before we got our hands on it,'' said Mr. Abramson. Instead of wrapping residential apartment blocks around small ''doughnut'' courtyards, there will be a two-acre park between Phase I and Phase II and a woonerf, a Dutch term for a pedestrian-oriented, tree-lined street, leading into the park from Speedwell Avenue and Early Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The facades of the proposed five- and six-story buildings, Mr. Abramson said, would be broken up with architectural elements like cornices, lintels, different-colored brick and brick patterns influenced by existing and historic Morristown architecture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans to realign Spring and Early Streets within the redevelopment area to ease rush-hour traffic have been scrapped for now as too costly and too destructive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the Town Council agrees to the amended plan -- expected to occur late this month or in September -- Mr. Murphy will seek approval from the planning board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd like to see the shovels in the ground in the spring,'' Mayor Dougherty said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tantleff said: ''Morristown is hot. There's a demand for it. You've got to maximize on that. You've got to come to a meeting of the minds and get on with it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> is in talks to sell a major portion of <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>'s real estate portfolio to the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> for up to $1 billion, a person briefed on the matter told DealBook on Tuesday, as the bank seeks to raise additional capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The holdings in question include a variety of commercial properties and real estate stakes around the world, said this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were continuing and might fall apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sale would be the latest effort by <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> to sell noncore assets to help shore up its balance sheet. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s stock has slumped 25.7 percent over the last month, propelled in part by investor fears that the bank would need to sell additional shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> officials have denied considering such a move and argue that the bank has adequate capital. But it is still turning to asset sales to strengthen its capital ratios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, the bank announced it was selling its $8.6 billion Canadian credit card business to the TD Bank Group for an undisclosed amount, and that it was putting its remaining European card portfolio on the block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, it sold a portfolio of mortgages; according to The Wall Street Journal, the buyer was <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, and the purchase price was more than $500 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Blackstone, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> has an able and hungry would-be buyer. The investment giant struck one of the biggest real estate deals since the financial crisis, paying $9.4 billion to take over Centro Properties' American malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackstone still has more money to spend. Its real estate arm had $7.4 billion in "dry powder," or uninvested capital, as of June 30. And the firm disclosed last month that it had begun raising its latest real estate fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two firms have done business before. Last year, Blackstone began managing an Asian real estate investment portfolio from <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>. Merrill owned a portion of the fund, which was worth some $2 billion at the time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three busy traffic arteries border Belle Haven, a Menlo Park neighborhood that has been shut out of Silicon Valley's historic accumulation of wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Belle Haven residents earn less than half as much as other Menlo Park wage earners. Modest homes, some boarded up, line the streets. People swelter under the bright sun as they wait for the bus, because Belle Haven's spartan bus stops provide little shelter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You know how normally you have a desert, and in the desert you have a little oasis?'' said Matt Henry, president of the Belle Haven Neighborhood Association. ''With us, it's just the exact opposite. We're here in Silicon Valley, which is absolutely wonderful. But we're the little small desert in the middle of something great.'' Now, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, the world's largest social network, is moving in to the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Facebook</span> has grown to more than 750 million active users and is on the verge of an initial public offering projected to value the company at $100 billion. After outgrowing its Palo Alto headquarters, the company is moving to Belle Haven, where it is creating a campus large enough to accommodate nearly 10,000 employees. The move is to be completed by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents of Belle Haven and its neighbor East Palo Alto, which is also entrenched in an urban malaise, hope <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s arrival signals their long-awaited integration into the Silicon Valley economy. They picture the company's wealth and dynamism spreading across the freeways, bringing better housing, services and schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The table is being set for some really great things to happen,'' said Charley Scandlyn, executive director of the Ravenswood Education Foundation, which aims to bring East Palo Alto schools up to the same standards as those in neighboring communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The whole <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> mission is about connecting people,'' Mr. Scandlyn said. ''Sometimes our kids in East Palo Alto don't feel like they get to be a part of the good dreams in the world. Here is <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, that actually gets to live out its mission in its own neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may not be that easy. Across the Bay Area, cities continue to hope that tech companies will provide the spark for a renaissance in low-income communities. Earlier this year, for example, San Francisco granted Twitter a six-year tax holiday to lure the company to the blighted mid-Market district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is no conclusive evidence that the presence of a technology company can turn a neighborhood or a city around. <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s hometown, Mountain View, still struggles to pay its bills and is threatening to lay off employees, despite the presence of several tech companies, including <span class="companylink">Google</span>, with a combined value of well over $200 billion. Belle Haven's hopeful uncertainty underscores the growing disconnect between a technology boom fueled by the explosive growth of social media companies and the continuing struggles of the communities in which those companies are located.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to economists and public officials, the divide is related to the nature of the tech economy, much of which takes place in cyberspace, removed from the world of cash registers, low-income jobs and sales taxes. Companies like <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> pay property taxes, but cities draw little direct economic benefit from their core businesses. Their highly skilled, highly educated employees commute to lavish, insular campuses where most of their needs are met.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A social networking company doesn't have as much revenue-generating material,'' said David Johnson, Menlo Park's business development manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Johnson said he was pleased to have found a company to fill the vacated one-million-square-foot property once occupied by <span class="companylink">Sun Microsystems</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How can you not be excited about <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> coming to town -- it's a potential game changer for that whole part of town,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''They are showing all indications of being a great corporate neighbor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Menlo Park officials said that as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> expanded, the city would have leverage to negotiate additional compensation. The site is currently zoned for 3,600 employees. Once <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> outgrows that number, ''the city will be looking for something in exchange,'' said Justin Murphy, Menlo Park's development manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its recent approval of a hotel project, the city agreed to alter zoning requirements in exchange for a guarantee that the developer would spend $1.25 million on capital improvements and lock in the amount of revenue the city would receive from a hotel transient tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Facebook</span> started moving groups of employees to its new location in July. Company officials said they were just getting to know the neighborhood, attending events like the Menlo Park Block Party in June and talking to City Council members and community leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll try to become part of the community,'' John Tenanes, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s director of facilities, said in an interview. ''We're trying to build the right relationships.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> employees are already volunteering in the community, helping middle school students in East Palo Alto build robots and hosting the East Palo Alto Boys and Girls Club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The block party was in Menlo Park's bustling downtown, filled with cafes, boutiques and leafy medians. But Belle Haven has a decidedly different feel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though crime has decreased in recent years, the neighborhood still has the highest concentration of Menlo Park's crime. Test scores in the Ravenswood School District, shared by Belle Haven and East Palo Alto, were in the bottom 12 percent of California districts in 2010. The Menlo Park district scored in the top 3 percent in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics note that parents have long found ways to escape the Ravenswood schools. One escape route is the district's two charter schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of these charter schools are coming in and scooping off the cream, and leaving, basically, the public school system with the poverty-stricken dregs,'' said William Webster, the founder of a community development organization in East Palo Alto and a member of the Rent Stabilization Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although some real estate agents said that a few <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> employees have asked about houses or rentals in the neighborhood, most agents say they are not getting any such calls. Investors and real estate agents are unsure how many people will move to a neighborhood where crime is high and schools are low-performing, especially with <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> providing transportation options like car pool matching and shuttles from the Caltrain station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Pierce, president of the investment group Prodesse Properties, said he did not expect <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s move to cause a rush of people to Belle Haven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People have said with that close-in real estate, something has got to change, and someday it might happen,'' Mr. Pierce said. ''I wouldn't run out and invest my money there, because there's a lot of risk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some people, like Mr. Scandlyn of the Ravenswood Education Foundation, see signs that the ''someday'' is coming. Mr. Scandlyn pointed to an event this summer in which <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> volunteers worked in the East Palo Alto schools' technology labs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One day,'' he said, ''our schools will not only be achieving but actually reflecting a more diverse world and the world that <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> is reaching out to.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By KIRK SEMPLE </div><div>1292 words</div><div>11 August 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese banks have poured more than $1 billion into real estate loans in New York City in the past year. Investors from China are snapping up luxury apartments and planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on commercial and residential projects like Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn. Chinese companies have signed major leases at the Empire State Building and at 1 World Trade Center, which is the centerpiece of the rebuilding at ground zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment in the city by companies and entrepreneurs from China has been surging in the last few years, recalling the boom in Japanese investment that swept the region in the 1980s and helping to buoy the local economy even as the country as a whole struggles to get out of recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese investments are occurring with little fanfare, in part because Chinese executives tend to shun publicity. But back home, their government is urging them to invest overseas to diversify China's foreign-exchange holdings, develop business partnerships and improve the country's leverage in international affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Fasulo, managing director of <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, which tracks commercial real estate sales, was combing through his files the other day for deals in New York City that involved Chinese investments. As the list grew longer and longer, he paused, a tone of surprise in his voice. ''It's truly amazing how much they've been able to do without being highlighted in public,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delegations of Chinese officials and executives have been sweeping through the city, on a nearly weekly basis, assessing the markets, searching for office locations and meeting prospective partners and clients. Last month, officials and executives from China and the United States filled a ballroom at the Waldorf-Astoria to make deals during a business conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody wants to come to New York because New York is the starting point for going global,'' said Xue Ya, president of the China Center, a business and cultural organization that was the first tenant to sign a lease at 1 World Trade Center, where it will occupy six floors. Once established in New York, Mrs. Xue said, ''you are a player.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even one of the region's fastest growing construction companies is Chinese. The company, China Construction America, has won contracts on major public works projects, including the Tappan Zee and Alexander Hamilton Bridges, the No. 7 subway line extension and the $91 million <span class="companylink">Metro-North Railroad</span> station at Yankee Stadium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China Construction is a subsidiary of a state-controlled construction company in China. The wave of Japanese investment in the city a generation ago -- epitomized by the purchase of a controlling stake in Rockefeller Center by the <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Estate Company</span> of Tokyo in 1989 -- stirred anxiety and even xenophobia. Some New Yorkers saw it as evidence that the city and the country were losing their dominant positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, city officials are welcoming Chinese investment as a boon to the local economy. But in a report in May, the Asia Society and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars warned that on a national level, protectionist impulses and anti-China sentiment, particularly in Washington, could scare away investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flush with capital from its enormous trade surpluses, China has been on an investment spree, especially in developing countries. While the size of China's investments in the United States pales in comparison with investments by other countries, it has nevertheless been growing rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In terms of overall flow from China into the U.S., many of us believe that it could accelerate very quickly, and it could even parallel what Japanese investment did in the mid-'80s,'' said Clarence Kwan, a senior partner at Deloitte, a business services firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese government is acutely interested in diversifying its foreign exchange reserves beyond United States Treasuries. One sign of this is the push by Chinese state-run banks to invest their money in commercial real estate in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the largest loans by a single lender in the city since 2008, the Bank of China lent $800 million late last year to refinance a building on Park Avenue housing <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> and Major League Baseball, analysts said. Among other deals, the Bank of China recently agreed to lend more than $250 million to refinance an office tower at 3 Columbus Circle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts, as well as American and Chinese officials, said it was hard to calculate the precise size of Chinese investment in New York, or even the number of deals with Chinese involvement, because of the complexities of international business arrangements and privacy laws. But experts said the current level of interest was only a hint of what could come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cong Zhong, chairman of Kingee Cultural Development Company, a conglomerate based in Beijing that makes Chinese decorative products, said he planned a foothold in North America with a flagship retail store on Fifth Avenue. ''If we start from New York,'' Mr. Zhong explained in a telephone interview from Beijing, ''it will be easier to expand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ning Yuan, president of China Construction America, said he had not faced anti-Chinese sentiment. The company, based in Jersey City, uses union workers on its projects in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So far so good,'' Mr. Yuan said. ''Our company has a lot of experience in the past 20 to 30 years in China. The economy in China is booming, and a lot of the construction projects have been done by our company. It's good for the local market that we can bring our expertise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese money is also poised to flow into the city through a federal program that offers the possibility of permanent residency to foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in certain development projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under this program, known as EB-5, Forest City Ratner Companies has arranged for $249 million in loans from Chinese investors for residential and office towers at Atlantic Yards, the commercial and residential project in Brooklyn that includes a new stadium for the New Jersey Nets. The developers of a hospital and hotel project in Flushing, Queens, have lined up about $30 million in financing from China, turning away scores of other interested investors, said Richard Xia, president of the firm raising the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tourism from China is booming in New York as well, helping to sustain the hotel, restaurant and retail sectors. In 2010, 266,000 Chinese people visited the city, a 45 percent increase over 2009, according to NYC &amp; Company, the city's tourism arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end real estate agents are doing their best to accommodate the influx.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said her firm had fielded a ''huge'' increase in inquiries from wealthy Chinese looking for luxury residential properties, ''some in the $30-million-plus range.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We went from zero to 200 miles per hour in six months,'' she said. ''This year, it's the biggest buzz word in real estate: 'Chinese.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xiaolan Shang, an agent with Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that five years ago, she had very few international clients. Now, about 90 percent of her client base is Chinese -- and most pay in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've had people come to New York only for the weekend,'' Ms. Shang recalled. ''They see the apartment, they make the offer and right away they fly back to China.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Cash deal,'' she added. ''Right away.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kirby, 50, is a founder and the chairman of Green Street Advisors, an independent research and consulting firm that tracks the commercial real estate industry, with an emphasis on real estate investment trusts, or REITs, public companies that disburse most of their income as dividends. Mr. Kirby, who started the company in 1985, also serves as its research director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How did the firm get started?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I was 24 -- straight out of University of Chicago business school -- when I started the company with Jon Fosheim. He stayed for 20 years, then went off to start up a hedge fund. We started Green Street to do something a little different than what it now does: we were looking for opportunities in the junkyard, basically distressed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We came across a couple of REITs that bankers were having problems with, and did our own due diligence. We came to the conclusion, in the case of one, that the company was worth less than zero. Then we came across a research report by a major Wall Street house that said this company was a $12 stock and that they just did an equity offering. That's when the light bulb went on over our heads that a) nobody really understood the real estate in REITs; and b) the conflicts were pretty egregious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How have REITs changed since you began tracking them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A REITs were a $10 billion niche; now it's about $350 billion. We follow over 90 percent of the market cap of U.S. REITs and now over 50 percent of the market cap in European REITs. Our business grows as the industry grows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What is your assessment of the domestic REIT market?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A REITs had a great 2.5-year run: they delivered total returns of 27 percent two years ago and 20 percent last year, and this year they're up something like 10 percent year to date. That's the good news. The bad news is, that came on the heels of a 75 percent drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q So what does this mean for average investors?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Most people should be 5 to 10 percent in real estate; it's an asset class that tends to zig when other things zag, and so it's a good diversifier. To the investor already in REITs, it's probably not a bad idea to be on the lighter side of allocation. Today we sort of view the valuations as on the rich side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Who are your main clients?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Generally mutual fund managers or pension fund advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Are you bullish on any commercial property sectors now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A The one sector that's just on fire is apartments, and this is true in New York and nationwide. So what's happened in apartment land is, the fundamentals didn't weaken as much as in the other sectors. During the downturn, they were supported by the fact that the homeownership rate declined through the recession, creating more demand for apartments. Meanwhile, there's been very little construction in the last few years, and really there won't be any in another year or two. That has been sort of a perfect storm for apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How is the New York office market faring?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New York is doing better right now from a fundamental and a valuation perspective. We didn't see anything near the layoffs we feared we might during the downturn, and there is increasing demand. You're also seeing rents jump up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're buying in New York today, you really have to be pretty bullish that New York is always going to be the dominant place that attracts the best and the brightest of whatever industry, which has certainly been true over the last 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Do you have any numbers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A During the trough in early- to mid-'09, Manhattan office values went down over 50 percent, and since then they've rallied up 78 percent from the trough. So today we're 15 to 20 percent lower than the '07 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q A couple of years ago it was difficult even to put a value on many properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Right, it was pretty much a guessing game. The market is pretty liquid now. Pricing among higher-quality property has really skyrocketed in the past two years. I think that's going to level off because we're going to see a lot more stuff get put up for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q That's good for all the cash-ready institutions, like REITs, waiting on the sidelines to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A In the last year they've had trouble finding enough stuff to buy. A lot of REITs are well positioned to take advantage of any buying opportunities. I don't think they're going to be necessarily distressed sales. There will be bidding contests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Your bio says you were born on Christmas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A It's kind of nice having a birthday on Christmas once you're older, because then you could either ignore it or at least you've got all your family around.</p>

</div><div class="author">By NICK BILTON   </div><div>543 words</div><div>5 August 2011</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2011 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've recently learned that real estate brokers in San Francisco have reached a consensus on a topic that&nbsp;entrepreneurs&nbsp;and investors can't seem to agree on: that we are in the midst of a technology bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technologists have been debating the existence of such a&nbsp;bubble for over a year now, but they just can't seem to agree.&nbsp;Some argue that companies like Twitter, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and LinkedIn, are overvalued with multi-billion dollar valuations. Others say that technology companies are actually undervalued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate brokers in San Francisco have seen the evidence of a new dot-com style bubble: Rents are shooting up as the demand for apartments grows. As a newcomer to San Francisco, I can attest to how frantic the search for apartments has become in the area, and to the often audacious pricing of rental properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An&nbsp;article published on Thursday in The San Francisco Examiner notes that Bay Area renters are now seeing rent hikes that are eerily similar to those&nbsp;during the dot-com bubble that&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;a little more than a decade ago.&nbsp;RealFacts, a real estate analysis firm, told the Examiner that a&nbsp;new wave of San Francisco residents who work for technology giants and start-ups seemed to be responsible for the rise in apartment rental costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think a lot of new dot-com employees,&nbsp;specifically&nbsp;those who work for companies like Apple, <span class="companylink">Google</span> and Twitter, are now moving into the city and can afford to pay much higher rents," said Sally Kuchar, editor of the real estate blog Curbed San Francisco, told me in a phone interview.&nbsp;"As a result, San Francisco rental rates have risen by 6 percent between 2010 and 2011."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a very recent&nbsp;transplant to San Francisco, I've visited dozens of open houses over the past week and already see a frightful pattern. When I show up to see a property there is always a long line of young people, mostly wearing t-shirts adorned with Twitter, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or <span class="companylink">Google</span> logos, who are standing at the ready with an application, credit report and deposit check in hand. They often bid up the price of an apartment by several hundred dollars too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate brokers I've spoken with note that although the San Francisco market has always been&nbsp;challenging for renters, the current state of affairs is&nbsp;extraordinary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kuchar of Curbed said rents were also rising because more landlords were choosing to turn their properties into short-term rentals using services like AirBnB, a company that lets people rent out their spare bedrooms or homes to travelers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of residential property owners are now converting their long-term rentals into vacation rentals; that has also depleted the market," Ms. Kuchar said. She also said that though high real estate prices make it clear there is a new bubble in Silicon Valley, no one can really predict how long it will take before it pops.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Retreating on Every Front: Time to Say It: Double Dip May Be Happening</span>
</div><div class="author">By FLOYD NORRIS   </div><div>1084 words</div><div>5 August 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Double dip may be back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been three decades since the United States suffered a recession that followed on the heels of the previous one. But it could be happening again. The unrelenting negative economic news of the past two weeks has painted a picture of a United States economy that fell further and recovered less than we had thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When what may eventually be known as Great Recession I hit the country, there was general political agreement that it was incumbent on the government to fight back by stimulating the economy. It did, and the recession ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Great Recession II, if that is what we are entering, has provoked a completely different response. Now the politicians are squabbling over how much to cut spending. After months of wrangling, they passed a bill aimed at forcing more reductions in spending over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this is the beginning of a new double dip, it will have two significant things in common with the dual recessions of 1980 and 1981-82.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In each case the first recession was caused in large part by a sudden withdrawal of credit from the economy. The recovery came when credit conditions recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in each case the second recession began at a time when the usual government policies to fight economic weakness were deemed unavailable. Then, the need to fight inflation ruled out an easier monetary policy. Now, the perceived need to reduce government spending rules out a more accommodating fiscal policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American economy fell into what was at first a fairly mild recession at the end of 2007. But the downturn turned into a worldwide plunge after the failure of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> in September 2008 led to the vanishing of credit for nearly all borrowers not deemed super-safe. Banks in the United States and other countries needed bailouts to survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unavailability of credit caused a decline in world trade volumes of a magnitude not seen since the Great Depression, and nearly every economy went into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it turned out that businesses overreacted. While sales to customers fell, they did not decline as much as production did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That fact set the stage for an economic rebound that began in mid-2009, with the National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of such things, determining that the recession ended in June of that year. Manufacturers around the world reported rapidly rising orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, most observers believed the American economy was in a slow recovery, albeit one with very disappointing job growth. The official figures on gross domestic product showed the United States economy grew to a record size in the final three months of 2010, having erased the loss of 4.1 percent in G.D.P. from top to bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then last week the government announced its annual revision to the numbers for the last several years. New government surveys indicated Americans had spent less than previously estimated in 2009 and 2010 on a wide range of things, including food, clothing and computers. Tax returns showed Americans even cut back on gambling. The recession now appears to have been deeper -- a top-to-bottom fall of 5.1 percent -- and the recovery even less impressive. The economy is still smaller than it was in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, more American manufacturers said new orders fell than rose, according to a survey by the Institute for Supply Management. The margin was small, but the survey had shown rising orders for 24 consecutive months. Manufacturers in most European countries, including Germany and Britain, also reported weaker new orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 1980, a recession was started when the government -- despairing of its failure to bring down surging inflation rates -- invoked controls aimed at limiting the expansion of credit and making it more costly for banks to make loans. Those controls proved to be far more effective than anyone expected, and the economy promptly tanked. In July the credit controls were ended, and the economic research bureau later determined that the recession ended that month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the first quarter of 1981 the economy was larger than it had been at the previous peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But little had been done about inflation, and the Federal Reserve was determined to slay that dragon. With interest rates high, home sales plunged in late 1981 to the lowest level since the government began collecting the data in 1963. Now they are even lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, of course, no assurance that a new recession has begun or will do so soon, and a positive jobs report on Friday morning could revive some optimism. But concerns have grown that the essential problems that led to the 2007-09 recession were not solved, just as inflation remained high throughout the 1980 downturn. Housing prices have not recovered, and millions of Americans owe more in mortgage debt than their homes are worth. Extremely low interest rates helped to push up corporate profits, but companies have hired relatively few people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any other cycle, the recent spate of poor economic news would have resulted in politicians vying with one another to propose programs to revive growth. President Obama has called for more spending on infrastructure, but there appears to be little chance Congress will take any action. The focus in Washington is now on deciding where to reduce spending, not increase it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been some hints that the Federal Reserve might be willing to resume purchasing government bonds, which it stopped doing in June, despite opposition from conservative members of Congress. But the revised economic data may indicate that the previous program -- known as QE2, for quantitative easing -- had even less impact than had been thought. With short-term interest rates near zero, the Fed's monetary policy options are limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government stimulus programs historically have often appeared to be accomplishing little until the cumulative effect suddenly helps to power a self-sustaining recovery. This time, the best hope may be that the stimulus we have already had will prove to have been enough.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like voters everywhere, the people of Nassau County had watched helplessly as Congress and the White House played poker over the nation's debt limit, with a potential fiscal and economic catastrophe hanging in the balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, on Monday, they were given an opportunity to lash out, close to home, over something more comprehensible but not entirely dissimilar: the suggestion that their debt-ridden, overtaxed county should borrow and tax hundreds of millions of dollars more for a new arena for the once-proud New York Islanders hockey team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By a wide margin, they said no.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spectacular defeat for the Islanders' owner, Charles B. Wang, and his allies in county government was caused by an unlikely but broad coalition: Tea Party members and Democratic leaders, elderly residents already worried about the fate of Social Security and Medicare, parents of young children and powerful real estate developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also raised the prospect that Long Island's only major sports team -- the winner of four Stanley Cups in the 1980s -- might pick up and move in 2015, when its lease at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum expires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews on Tuesday across a dense slice of suburbia stretching from the 40-year-old coliseum in Uniondale to the county government complex in Mineola, voters still rattled by the federal showdown over the debt limit said they opposed the plan for a new arena. They explained that they were less concerned about the future of a faded hockey franchise than about paying their monthly bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't afford a ticket to go to the Islanders,'' said Alessandra de Bellegarde, 54, of Manhasset, a special education teacher. ''I'm constantly watching so I don't go over my budget. I wish politicians would do the same. Why are they saying they want this deal when people are cutting back on food and losing jobs?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Stop &amp; Shop in Carle Place, Pat Marinacci, 68, a retired postal clerk, said property taxes in the county were already high enough. ''I can't imagine what made them think homeowners were going to pay for it,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The last thing we need is a new stadium,'' she added. ''It disregards the entire economic state of the union. It's like, are we on the same planet?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others called the proposal a giveaway that the county, whose finances were taken over by a state control board in January, could ill afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the people that are interested in the stadium should be able to pay for it,'' said Joseph Gordon, 89, a retired business owner, as he shopped at a supermarket in Carle Place. ''It's a scam.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arena plan -- supported by Mr. Wang and the Nassau County executive, Edward P. Mangano -- went not just against public opinion, but also against the tide in stadium construction, which has heavily favored private financing ever since a wave of publicly financed ballparks and arenas failed to generate the promised economic benefits. The San Diego Chargers football team has struggled even to get a ballot measure for a new stadium, and the suburb of Glendale, Ariz., faces lawsuits for trying to bail out the bankrupt Coyotes hockey team in exchange for the team's dropping Phoenix from its name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wang and Mr. Mangano had promised that a new arena, and an adjacent minor-league ballpark thrown in as a sweetener, would create new jobs and local revenues. But with the Islanders' attendance the worst in the N.H.L. last season, they were unable to guarantee it. Rather than raising the $400 million price tag through a revenue bond paid off with incremental sales taxes and concession receipts, they proposed a general-obligation bond, which would be paid off with increased property taxes on county residents for the next 30 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernie Lowsky, 72, a retired business owner, said he voted for the bond issue because he thought it would stimulate the economy and create jobs. But he confessed to another motive: He wanted a reason to buy season tickets again. ''I was a big-time fan years ago, but now that they're awful, I go considerably less,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In hindsight, for Mr. Mangano, a Republican, the referendum campaign looked like a triple dose of political hemlock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, he alienated the public workers' unions, which would be a vital constituency in a re-election campaign, by spending $2.2 million on the ballot measure after laying off 128 county workers on July 1. ''Services should come before sports,'' said Jerry Laricchiuta, president of the Nassau civil servants' union, the second-largest in New York State.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Mr. Mangano outraged Tea Party groups, whose antitax fervor had secured his narrow and surprising victory over a Democratic incumbent in 2008. That incumbent had proposed an even bigger plan for a new Islanders arena, which would have been paid for by the team, not the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. Mangano also infuriated the island's wealthy and politically connected roster of real estate developers, each of whom wanted a fair chance at building on the coliseum site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's probably the most expensive piece of property on Long Island,'' said Desmond Ryan, executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, the developers' lobby. ''It's the crown jewel. And to sole-source that property to an individual just because he owned a hockey team made no sense.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ryan's group ran advertisements opposing the plan in weekly newspapers and on the radio. Tea Party members handed out leaflets at train stations. Meanwhile, Mr. Wang, in what some said was a tactical error, bought advertisements on television and in Newsday, appealing to his core supporters but also giving the issue wider exposure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proponents of the stadium plan also did not count on the debt-limit showdown in Washington, which appeared to have heightened voters' sensitivity to concerns about borrowing capacity, spending and fiscal responsibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ryan said that when he heard President Obama warn that retirees' Social Security checks could be endangered if Congress did not vote to raise the debt limit, ''I was sitting in my living room with my wife, saying, 'I could kiss that guy right now.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result was a voter turnout of 17 percent -- five times what proponents had expected for a Monday in August -- and a rejection of the stadium plan, 57 percent to 43 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late Tuesday, Mr. Mangano's aides were privately playing down the failure of the proposal, suggesting that Mr. Mangano's goal all along was to be able to say he had done all he could to keep the Islanders in Nassau. Now, if they leave, voters will have only themselves to blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Publicly, however, Mr. Mangano was offering to field proposals from any developer interested in a new plan for the coliseum site, with or without a hockey team.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, planners, politicians and businessmen have debated the future of the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum and the land around it. On Monday, residents will have the chance to vote on the latest proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan before the voters would overhaul the Coliseum and the surrounding 77 acres. It includes spending $400 million to build a new arena for the New York Islanders hockey team, a minor league baseball park and new convention space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But like so many other land use issues on Long Island, this plan, unveiled in May, has proved to be contentious, setting off finger-pointing, backbiting and political posturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has also been expensive: holding the vote in August, instead of on Election Day, will cost more than $2 million, and the Islanders and their supporters have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars more on billboards, radio and newspaper advertisements and robocalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has also created some unlikely allies. The backers of the deal include County Executive Edward P. Mangano and many other Republicans, construction unions, some land use groups, the Islanders and their fans, and even rival teams in the N.H.L., the Rangers and the Devils.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal is opposed by Democratic leaders, fiscal conservatives and some developers, who say that the financially beleaguered county should not be going further into debt to help Charles Wang, who owns the Islanders, and that the property could generate far more in taxes if it were privately developed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vote comes at a pivotal time. The finances of Nassau County, one of the most affluent counties in the United States, are such a mess that they are monitored by the Nassau County Interim Finance Authority, a fiscal control board authorized by the state. The county could run a deficit of up to $140 million this year, the authority said, adding that if the arena deal is approved, voters could pay 4 percent more in property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like others who view sports venues as economic stimuli, Mr. Mangano and his backers say that the property tax increases will be more than offset by the creation of new jobs and $400 million in profits that they expect to be produced during the 30-year life of the bonds issued to pay for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also say that if a new arena is not built, the Islanders will move and Nassau will lose thousands of jobs and a cultural hub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As cities like Cincinnati, Houston and Seattle have learned, the construction of stadiums and arenas almost always costs more than expected, rarely produces the economic benefits initially promised and can saddle local governments with tens of millions of dollars in debts, driving holes through budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So while many Nassau residents prefer to replace an arena they consider an outdated eyesore (it was built in 1972) because they still want a place to see concerts and sporting events, they are mindful that it will quite likely come at a heavy cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm on the border on this,'' said Bob Orosz, 64, a retired radiological technician who lives in Garden City and recently attended a presentation on the plan by county officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a Catch-22,'' he said. ''If it's passed, our taxes are going to go up. If it fails, our taxes are going to go up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the referendum passes on Monday, the plan will go to the Nassau County Legislature and to the finance authority; either one could revise or kill the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contention around the subject is matched by contention about the vote itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say that by holding the referendum on a Monday in August, when many voters are on vacation or disinterested, Mr. Mangano is trying to ensure that only residents with a strong interest, like construction workers and hockey fans, will head to the polls. They say it would have been fairer as well as cheaper to hold the vote on Election Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William T. Biamonte, the Democratic commissioner on the Nassau County Board of Elections, said, ''The sad thing is if we did this in November, it wouldn't cost us 10 cents and there would be more public input.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The county executive has said a vote during the summer ensures that the measure is not buried on the ballot and turned into a political sticking point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. Wang, who has been uncharacteristically visible during the campaign, has promised to cover the costs of the special election, if the ballot measure passes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as in so many campaigns to persuade voters to pay for big projects, the sharpest barbs have been traded over the economics of the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The county executive and the Islanders point to several studies that say a new arena will produce the equivalent of 1,515 construction jobs, 3,040 permanent jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars of profit after the construction bonds are paid off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe that the rewards here significantly outweigh the risks associated with creating a sports entertainment destination,'' Mr. Mangano said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the finance authority said it expected property taxes to rise 3.5 percent to 4 percent if the county issues $400 million in bonds, Michael Picker, senior vice president of the Islanders, said it would be a reasonable price to pay to keep the team; its lease expires in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the team were to leave, he said, the Coliseum would be unable to compete with arenas in Manhattan, Brooklyn and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mangano said that there was no Plan B, and that the Coliseum would have trouble surviving without the Islanders. Still, critics of the plan say the county executive and the team are not telling voters that there are other options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They include refurbishment of the arena, new owners for the team, and other types of development, including elements of a mixed-use Lighthouse Project that Mr. Wang once championed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opponents also say the forecasts for the arena are unreasonable. The construction jobs, while potentially lucrative, will be temporary, and 2,000 people already work at the arena, so the number of new jobs would be smaller than advertised, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team and outside experts project attendance at the Coliseum to rise by about a third even as tickets prices increase. The Islanders make the assumption that they will host six playoff games a year, though the team has made the playoffs just four times since 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Hamer, a board member at the Association for a Better Long Island, which represents real estate developers, said that if the referendum passed, the lease would give Mr. Wang an inside track to develop the property, though the county executive insists that the county retains the rights. Mr. Hamer said the land could generate about $1 million in taxes per acre if it were privately developed, far more than the $14 million in minimum lease payments that Mr. Wang would pay under the proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wang wants to make money and Mangano wants to save the Islanders,'' said Clifford B. Sondock, the president of the Land Use Institute, which opposes the project. ''Ed and Charles have made this an issue of the Islanders when it is really a real estate deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The polls will be open for the referendum from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN a baby whale lost its way and wandered into the mouth of the Gowanus Canal in 2007, it was christened Sludgie the Whale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The name stuck. When Sludgie died after two days of rescue attempts, there was sadness but little surprise. Something from the natural world had found itself in one of the most unnatural places in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, pollution and neglect have turned the canal into a fetid stew of dangerous chemicals and toxins, an embodiment of the worst excesses of the industrial age. As if that were not enough, every heavy rain washes in fresh tides of raw sewage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is hardly the kind of image one would expect to draw homeowners to the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But developers came, envisioning Brooklyn's next big thing. Nothing, it seemed, could slow the rush, not even the sputtering housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city moved aggressively to rezone much of the area for residential development and spent millions of dollars on new infrastructure -- even as it planned major environmental cleanup efforts. One of the nation's largest developers, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, planned a luxury condo complex with the canal as a central feature. Another developer planned to transform a six-acre contaminated site into a complex with more than 700 units, including a large number of affordable apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cutting through two of Brooklyn's most expensive neighborhoods, Park Slope and Carroll Gardens, the 50 blocks around the 1.8-mile-long canal are dotted with forlorn industrial buildings, warehouses and empty lots, meaning plenty of room for large construction projects, a rarity in this crowded city. With prices soaring for homes only a block from the canal, the potential value of the land outweighed the negatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is, until the canal was designated a federal Superfund site last spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property owners around the canal who had been holding out for the highest price suddenly had no takers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had hundreds of developers knocking at our door,'' said Danny Tinneny, who owns several blocks along the canal. ''Now, no one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a decade of remediation on the horizon, building on the banks of the canal suddenly had the appeal of building on the hills of Vesuvius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a year since the developers stopped calling. But something interesting has happened in the interim. A different kind of development, which had been slowly but surely transforming the neighborhood before developers got interested, is now taking advantage of the halt in large-scale building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Artists and small businesses priced out of other neighborhoods have been taking up residence in the old warehouses. Nightclubs have popped up on streets that taxi repair shops and truck depots once dominated. Restaurants, bars and bakeries have all moved in, creating a scene that longtime Brooklyn residents compare to Dumbo before the multimillion-dollar lofts and Williamsburg before Bedford Avenue became a destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gowanus neighborhood finds itself at a crossroads, with an opportunity to think afresh about the best way to develop postindustrial land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Superfund provided a much-needed pause in the headlong rush to develop the area,'' said David Briggs, an architect and a founder of Gowanus by Design, a group created, according to its mission statement, in ''reaction to significant community concerns with the planning process in the Brooklyn neighborhoods around the Gowanus Canal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a place here, a special place that died and was left a terrible mess,'' Mr. Briggs said. ''It is now going to go through a long-term rebirth. It needs to be developed as a divergent, rich, textured community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Proteus Gowanus gallery at Nevins and Union Streets on the canal is part art space, part museum and part performance space -- and an example of a grass-roots business. Other newcomers include the Gowanus Studio Space, the Brooklyn Artists Gym and Pace Prints. Then there are the designers, light manufacturers and publishers setting up shop at the Old American Can Factory. And the Gowanus Dredgers have long organized canoe and kayak trips along the canal, offering a bankside glimpse at the city's industrial past -- and at a handful of houseboats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Briggs and Anthony Deen, Gowanus by Design's other founder, hope that the creative use of forlorn spaces will prevent the area from becoming what they describe as a lifeless enclave of million-dollar apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Carden, who in 2008 opened Bell House -- a music hall on Seventh Street between Second and Third Avenues and one of the first new businesses to move into the neighborhood -- says the change has already been significant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many buildings and storefronts that had been sitting empty have opened with some really interesting retail and restaurant spots,'' he said, giving as examples Bar Tano and Michael &amp; Ping's, a Chinese restaurant. ''Also, because the rents are not yet astronomical, you're seeing some great businesses that you might not see in a pricier neighborhood. Places like Brooklyn Homebrew on Eighth Street, where you can buy home-brew kits and ingredients, really give the neighborhood a unique quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fact that this miniretail explosion happened during the recession,'' Mr. Carden said, ''I think speaks to the potential of this neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That potential can be seen in the prices commanded by apartments and houses near the canal in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the corner of Bond and Third Streets, one block from the canal on the Carroll Gardens side, a condo development is 75 percent sold out. Studios in the building start at $316,000 and go all the way up to $1.55 million, for a 2,259-square-foot unit with two bedrooms, a recreation room, a rear yard and a terrace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the side streets that run between Bond and bustling Smith Street, one- and two-family homes routinely sell for $1.5 million to $2 million, and one recently set a local record for a new town house, topping $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think no one knew what the Superfund designation was going to do to the value of the existing property around here,'' said James Cornell, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Real Estate Group and the lead broker for the development at Third and Bond. ''At first, it changed the conversation with potential buyers. They would ask how it would affect them, do they need to be worried.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One woman showed up with her own spoon and plastic container to take soil samples from the backyard, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those questions quickly faded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one asks about it anymore,'' he said, noting that 80 percent of those who bought in the building came from surrounding Brooklyn neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Park Slope side of the canal, much of the land, even several blocks away from the water, is still zoned for industrial development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighborhood groups won a fight to prevent the area from being rezoned for residential development, concerned that it would result in a landscape similar to the one along Fourth Avenue, which is generally considered the southern edge of Park Slope. After that thoroughfare was rezoned, large apartment buildings sprang up and the street became crowded with parking garages, leaving scant room for retail spaces and creating zones with little street life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Below Fourth Avenue, as one moves closer to the canal, new uses are being found for many of the old warehouses. At the Pilates Garage, at Eighth Street and Third Avenue, it's sweat, not grease, that stains the floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the city is moving ahead with several ambitious infrastructure projects, including a pumping station on Butler Street that will help relieve the flow of sewage into the canal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a multimillion-dollar renovation at the Smith and Ninth Street subway station that business advocates say will help draw people to the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most significantly, for both developers and residents, a Whole Foods grocery store with more than 50,000 square feet of retail space is to open next spring near the canal on the corner of Third Avenue and Third Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of the new Whole Foods, first discussed as far back as 2006, is what drew many developers to the area before the Superfund designation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is to be built on contaminated land, or what is known as a brownfield, after the city and state oversee an environmental cleanup. Property inland from the canal does not fall under Superfund designation, which applies only to the waterway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the Superfund designation, many developers say, there are too many unknowns to justify the risk of investing millions of dollars in construction along the canal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Appel, the executive director of the Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation, said his organization had joined the Bloomberg administration in opposing the designation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's fears, he said, have been borne out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after designation occurred, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> backed out of plans to develop several blocks of property along the canal on the south side of Bond Street -- jettisoning a $5 million deposit rather than deal with the ensuing years of remediation and possible litigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Kramer, a principal at Hudson Companies, which developed the property at Third and Bond and is working with the city to develop Public Place, a large-scale housing complex with 774 apartments on the canal near Smith and Fifth Streets, said there were several ways the Superfund designation could stifle future development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first worry is that cleanup will take a long time to complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We thought the Superfund was going to put a halt on new development and slow things down for the next 10 to 20 years,'' Mr. Kramer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, developers are concerned that they will have to foot the bill for any unforeseen problems federal inspectors find.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Public Place site, like that of Whole Foods, is not part of the Superfund designation. But it is also on a brownfield, and must go through remediation, which could take years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kramer cited several considerations in developing around the canal, including practical questions about the science of environmental cleanup. Then there is the stigma of Superfund designation, which indicates contamination so severe that a federal mandate was considered necessary to effect a cleanup. Finally, financing issues come into play, both for construction and for property buyers seeking loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the moment, along much of the canal, the risks outweigh the potential reward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is bad news for Mr. Tinneny and others who own canal-front land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been a disaster,'' said Mr. Tinneny, whose several blocks of property are near the spot where <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> was going to build along Bond Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with little prospect of selling the land anytime soon, his son, also named Danny, decided to make lemonade out of lemons. In July he opened the 383 Bar and Grill in one of his family's buildings at 383 Carroll Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has been doing great,'' said the younger Mr. Tinneny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He notes that on the weekends, the banks of the canal become a scene, with the establishment of outdoor parties called Mr. Saturdays and Mr. Sundays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parties on the canal; people living in houseboats; kayakers gliding along the waterway; an opera on the canal at the Proteus gallery: all were once unthinkable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has been an environmental scar on this neighborhood for the last 150 years,'' Mr. Deen said. ''The question is, how can you start stitching these neighborhoods back together?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge going forward, Mr. Briggs said, will be to encourage the ''organic'' transformations of space that are already taking root while addressing the accumulated pollution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the population continues to grow, in New York City and elsewhere, there will be increasing pressure to develop environmentally problematic sites, which tend to be close to the heart of the city and to offer the kind of large tracts coveted by developers. What happens at the Gowanus Canal will surely be closely watched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are environmental issues, questions of infrastructure, real estate pressures, housing needs,'' Mr. Briggs said. ''We are hoping to find new ways of developing this 50-block area in a way that is true to the existing texture of the place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 7, 2011, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the status of development along the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn misidentified the location of a condominium building called Third and Bond. As an accompanying map and picture caption correctly noted, it is on Bond Street and Third Street, not Third Avenue.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asharoken</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JACQUELINE LEWISY, a saleswoman with Signature Premier Properties in Northport, steered her 19-foot Sea Ray through Northport Harbor toward Duck Island, an hourglass-shaped peninsula linked by a private road to the isthmus here. The view from the water was part of her tour of Duck Island Way, a secluded 21.7-acre estate with private beaches, lush woods, and an 11-bedroom 1929 shingled Swedish manor house. The property also has a three-bedroom guest cottage; a barn with a one-bedroom loft; a baseball field; and a pond. ''How can you not fall in love with this?'' Ms. Lewisy asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the west, Lloyd Harbor and Huntington Bay were peppered with sailboats, yacht clubs and marinas. Long Island Sound was visible to the north and east. Waterfront property has long been prime real estate, from Kings Point estates with views of Manhattan, to Centre Island spreads with tranquil views of Oyster Bay Harbor. On the Great South Bay, $400,000 bungalows are coveted in Lindenhurst, and grander residences sell for more than $2 million on Carlls River in Babylon Village. In the Hamptons, south of Route 27, oceanfront mansions command stratospheric prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The more expensive the area, the bigger the premium'' for waterfront, starting at 10 percent, said Dorothy Herman, the president and chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But across the price spectrum available to waterfront enthusiasts in all the Island's many different waterfront locations, these days such properties are taking longer to find buyers. North Shore real estate, generally far more expensive than that on the South Shore, tends to linger for that reason alone. The South Shore has different issues: buyers with more limited incomes, who are more susceptible to concerns about the costs of flood insurance and maintenance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Crary's family has a history on the North Shore. They have owned the Duck Island estate for four generations. He described it as ''a place out of time,'' with the feeling of ''being on the prow of a big ship.'' Yet despite its setting and views, it didn't generate much interest until recently, when, after four months, Ms. Lewisy dropped the asking price to $8 million from $12 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a tough market for waterfront property,'' Ms. Lewisy said. But the dip in prices over all makes it ''an opportunity for someone who does have the money to get their dream.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nassau during the first six months of the year, 102 waterfront homes sold or went into contract, with an average price of $1,010,595. For the 11 of them on the North Shore, sale prices averaged $2,582,500, said Gary Baumann, the manager of Prudential Douglas Elliman's Ronkonkoma office, using Multiple Listing Service of Long Island data. Of the 91 homes that sold on the South Shore, excluding the Hamptons, the average price was $721,878. (In the second quarter of this year, the average sales price of all homes on the Island was $436,143.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest-priced waterfront sale in Nassau was $6.8 million, for a Sands Point home first listed two years ago at $15 million. In Suffolk, the priciest waterfront sale, $7.78 million, was in Lloyd Harbor, down from its initial 2007 listing at $14.9 million. There are 529 waterfront homes on the market in Nassau County, with 114 listed under $500,000 and 57 over $3 million. In Suffolk, the 549 waterfront listings include 150 under $500,000 and 165 at $1 million to $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deborah Hauser, an associate broker at Daniel Gale <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> office of Cold Spring Harbor on the North Shore, said that homes with deepwater docks, which are difficult to get permits for, carry a $1 million premium, and that with inventory scant, they sell ''right away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Carolina Boucos of Daniel Gale's office in Glen Head, which is not as far east as Cold Spring Harbor, finds some buyers shying away. At her $1.699 million waterfront listing in Glen Cove, shoppers have been ''afraid of a northeaster coming,'' and have also expressed concern about wear and tear from saltwater, and pricey flood and homeowner insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlantic Beach, Annett C. Ellis, a boutique broker, described a different kind of micromarket, seeing waterfront as ''hot, hot, hot.'' Whether oceanfront, or bayfront on Reynolds Channel, ''they are selling and they are in demand and they are getting great prices,'' with ''a lot of cash buyers.'' She ascribed the boom to the village's easy access to the city. ''The Hamptons is too far,'' Ms. Ellis said, ''and they get tired of sitting in traffic.'' From Atlantic Beach, ''they can commute back and forth daily.'' Prices start at $417,000, for a bungalow, and exceed $3 million, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the South Shore in western Suffolk, said Georgia Westcott, broker-owner of Westcott Group Realty, all waterfront is not created equal. For boaters, homes on deep, wide canals with protected slips can carry a premium of $30,000 to $50,000 and be more desirable than bayfront property exposed to storms. A Jet Ski lift and room for kayaks and rowboats ups the ante.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet ''on the South Shore, when you buy a waterfront home,'' Ms. Westcott said, ''you give up privacy,'' because lots are smaller and closer together. ''When you find an acre or a treed property it is very much a commodity,'' she said, citing her $2.9 million listing for a four-bedroom home on 1.8 acres on Carlls River in Babylon. The place has a dock, a protected yacht slip and a sandy beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, in a place like Lindenhurst, a more middle-class area at greater risk of flooding than the North Shore, the $2,000 to $2,500 annual cost of flood insurance can be a deterrent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">El Paso and Ciudad Juarez lie together uncomfortably like an estranged couple, surrounded on all sides by mountains and desert. The cities are separated by the thin trickle of the Rio Grande, which flows through concrete channels, built to put an end to the river's natural habit of changing course and muddying boundaries. One side is Texas; the other, Mexico. The border's way of life -- its business, legitimate and otherwise -- has always relied upon the circumvention of this dividing line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cities are so close that you can sit on a park bench in El Paso and watch laundry wave behind a whitewashed house on a Juarez hillside. Thousands of commuters come across from Mexico every morning, waiting in a long line at the Paso del Norte bridge, snaking back up the seedy Avenida Juarez, past military checkpoints where hawkers wave tabloids full of tales of carnage. The recent war among various gangs and drug cartels has made Juarez one of the world's most dangerous cities, while across the way, El Paso remains calm, even eerily prosperous. It consistently ranks as one of the safest cities in the United States. This grotesque disparity has, in some ways, torn the cities apart. Few El Pasoans venture across the bridge anymore, if they can help it, while much of Juarez's middle and upper class has decamped to the other side of the border, taking their money, businesses, even their private schools with them, forming an affluent community in exile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I spent a lot of time in El Paso this winter and spring as the Mexican Army mounted a fragmentary campaign against the cartels and as American politicians of both parties exploited the spectacle for their own purposes. In Washington and Austin, the capital of Texas, in the faraway realm that borderland residents call the interior, conservatives were raising the specter of ''spillover violence,'' while President Obama was boasting of an unprecedented border fortification. In reality, spillover was notable for its scarcity -- when stray bullets from a Juarez gunfight improbably flew across the border and struck El Paso's City Hall last year, it made international news. But that's about the only physical damage the city has suffered. And the federal security buildup -- symbolized by an 18-foot, rust-colored fence that runs along city streets and through backyards, part of a 650-mile, $2.8 billion border wall -- was regarded around town as a threatening imposition. Some two million people are linked at this spot, by ties of blood and commerce, and its fluid social ecosystem still retains something unique and emblematic and perhaps worth saving. If scholars of globalization are right that we are moving toward a future in which all borders are profitably blurred, here is the starkest imaginable expression of that evolution, in all its heady promise and its perverse failings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a frigid morning in February, I met with Linda Arnold inside a small brick storefront in El Paso. ''Unless you are right here, I don't think you can get how intertwined this community is,'' Arnold told me. A midwife with frosted blond hair who favors jangly jewelry, Arnold was running a small business called the Casa de Nacimiento, catering to a specific subset of border-straddlers. At that moment, sweating through labor, were three women who had come over the bridges from Juarez with legal visas. The distance, about a mile and a half from the Rio Grande, was geographically negligible but enormously consequential. Giving birth here would deliver their children a precious advantage: it would make them Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arnold isn't an immigration zealot, or even an ideological liberal, despite the hippie-ish connotations of her profession. ''We're not going to sit around here and chant,'' she said as we spoke in her office, which contained a sculpture of a womb and a portrait of her own son, a soldier in uniform. ''This is a business, not a commune.'' What Arnold was offering for sale at Casa de Nacimiento, for $695, was a future untroubled by the border's impediments. Any child born at Arnold's birth center would possess American citizenship, courtesy of the 14th Amendment, and with it the ability to cross freely back and forth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is El Paso's way to make the most of the border's inequities. Arnold moved to town in 1985 with an impassioned commitment to natural childbirth and an entrepreneur's hunch about an untapped market. Mexican women had a long tradition of crossing the border to give birth, and Arnold soon made herself one of the busiest midwives in the state. Back when she started, getting over the border was as simple as wading across the Rio Grande or paying a ferryman a dollar for a tow on an inner tube. ''They would come in with their jeans still wet,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Arnold's discipline is more popular than it used to be, it's still not fully accepted by the American medical establishment, and many midwives in training find it difficult to gain experience. ''The volume's not there,'' Arnold said. El Paso, with its large, willing, cash-paying clientele, made an ideal destination for students. Though heightened security has put an end to the days of wet jeans, it is relatively easy for a resident of Juarez to obtain a U.S. border-crossing card, which permits short trips for social visits or shopping, and there is nothing illegal about crossing while pregnant -- at least for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While American nationality has always been a desirable asset in Juarez, it has become much more valuable -- sometimes a matter of life and death -- since the drug violence erupted in earnest three years ago. The children delivered at Casa de Nacimiento on the day we met would eventually be able to attend better schools, find better jobs and, if necessary, seek haven. I met a couple named Graciela and Milo, who brought their 2-week-old daughter, Jennifer, to Arnold's birth center for a postpartum checkup. The parents were Mexican citizens. (For reasons of privacy, the center insisted that their last names not be used.) Their first two children were born in their home country, but when it came time to have this one, they decided to cross over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Milo, a long-haul trucker who drives a route to Tijuana, said he just didn't feel safe anymore, as the conflict between the narcos degenerated into anarchy. Graciela, who was sitting with the infant wrapped in a blanket on her lap, said she wanted Jennifer to have better options when she got older. Left unsaid was the underlying assumption: that Mexico's crisis would stretch far into the future and that life for the vulnerable would become only more treacherous and exposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young Pepe Yanar stood in the glow of neon at a bar, his hair stylishly mussed, a gold cross dangling in the crook of his V-neck. ''Everybody here is from Juarez,'' he said as he surveyed the place, one of many that have opened on the well-to-do west side of El Paso over the last year or so. The Texan side of the border has traditionally been considered dowdier and strait-laced; Juarez used to be where Mexicans and Americans alike went for rollicking nightlife. But now many of its restaurants and clubs are closed, emptied by the violence, burned down by extortionists or cleared away by a dubious downtown renewal project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pepe told me about the event that drove out his own family: in November 2009, his father, Jose Yanar, was kidnapped as he made his way home from work for a dinner celebrating his 52nd birthday with his family. The kidnappers called, threatening to return his father in pieces if they did not receive a ransom of several hundred thousand dollars. Miraculously, Jose escaped -- he still has a semicircular scar on his arm where the kidnapper he grappled with bit down hard -- and immediately the whole family piled into a car and raced over the Paso del Norte bridge, abruptly severing themselves from their previous lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Yanar family is in the furniture business, and they had never considered themselves vulnerable to Mexico's violence. Pepe, his parents and his siblings were U.S. citizens, having been born in the United States, like the children of Casa de Nacimiento. Even though the family lived in Juarez, Pepe went to high school in America and then on to the University of Texas-El Paso, which offers in-state tuition to eligible Mexican residents. He and his friends spoke English and Spanish interchangeably, and they moved with assimilated ease on both sides of the border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juarez has always been fairly lawless -- the city's proximity to the border, its grounds for existence, also made it an ideal shipping point for drug cartels -- but until recently, it was possible for people like the Yanars to believe that the mounting trouble was just among the narcos. Something changed, though, in the last few years. The war began in Juarez around 2008, when the cartel based in Sinaloa, the marijuana- and opium-growing areas close to the Pacific Coast, moved in on the local organization, which controlled valuable smuggling routes. Since then, conflict has spread across much of Mexico's north, as various cartels, street gangs and crooked police units battle in a void of legitimate authority. Bolstered by American military and law-enforcement aid, amounting to $1.3 billion over the last three years, President Felipe Calderon has tried to smash the cartels by deploying the army, and he has sent thousands of soldiers into Juarez. The assault has eliminated some drug lords, but that has in turn encouraged turf and succession struggles, making for increasingly bloody upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conflict has claimed some 40,000 lives in Mexico since it began, and Juarez has seen a tenfold increase in its murder rate, reaching more than 3,000 homicides last year. El Paso, by contrast, had only five murders. Why the violence hasn't spread remains a mystery. Tightened border security seems not to have interrupted the cartels' operations. Drugs still come over the bridges in huge quantities, hidden in some fraction of the tens of millions of cars and trucks that annually make the legal crossing. The traffickers know that the U.S. authorities can't search everyone without hindering legitimate trade between Juarez and El Paso, which amounted to $71 billion last year. Once the product reaches the American side, it is whisked off to stash houses and moved on to retail markets in the interior; in the other direction, shrink-wrapped packages of $50 and $100 bills make their way back to Mexico, along with weapons. (One in eight gun dealers in America is located along the border.) Many analysts believe that the absence of violence here is due to a rational choice by the cartels, which calculate that creating chaos in the United States would disrupt this fairly free flow of goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The nature and the cause of violence in Mexico is driven in part by the border itself,'' says David Shirk, director of the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego. ''They're fighting for control of access to the other side. So to me, violence stops at the border because the need to control territory stops at the border. It's about real estate, and it's about corruption networks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although reliable figures are hard to come by, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center estimates that some 230,000 Mexicans have fled the violence, about half of them to the United States. While illegal immigration to the United States has dropped over all by about 80 percent from the mid-2000s because of tougher enforcement and the effects of the recession, border cities have seen a contrary phenomenon. Since 2009, according to the Census, the El Paso metropolitan area's population has grown to around 800,000 residents, up by 50,000, an undetermined but significant percentage of them coming from Juarez. Some have sneaked across the river and are thus difficult to count. Many others, however, have made the trip legally, at least initially, coming over the Rio Grande bridges on border-crossing cards -- the short-term visas are easy to overstay -- or via a program that offers green cards to foreign investors and their families, as long as they create at least 10 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jose Yanar opened a furniture store called Designer World on Texas Avenue, just off Interstate 10. He and his son both work there, coordinating orders with the family's factory, six miles away in Juarez, which they hadn't visited in 18 months. I visited Designer World one day and found the elder Yanar -- a bluff, barrel-chested boss nicknamed Pelon (Baldy) by his employees -- in an office next to the showroom, where he was keeping watch over the factory on a large flat-screen television that was divided into 16 quadrants, each of which was streaming a jerky feed from a closed-circuit camera. Periodically one of his several phones would screech, and Jose would carry on his daily business in Spanish with the walkie-talkie voice of a factory manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The people that I have there working for me, they're very loyal, and of course I pay them a little bit more,'' Jose said. Still, running a business from afar involves all sorts of annoying inefficiencies. He was afraid to set foot in Juarez, but not all of his managers had U.S. visas. So when he had to see them in person, he sometimes conducted meetings at the center of a border bridge, in the buffer zone beneath the Mexican and American flags.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Jose escaped his kidnappers, the whole family crowded in with a sister-in-law who already lived in El Paso, and they put their place in Juarez on the market. ''I still hope I can sell it,'' he said. ''But every single house in Juarez is for sale.'' Compared with what others were going through, though, these were minor hardships. Yanar purchased a house in El Paso, and soon he found his neighborhood was full of people he knew from the other side. His social life picked up. He didn't have to worry about his kids sneaking back into Juarez, because most of their friends had moved, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the beginning, it was very hard,'' Yanar said. ''Now I'm getting used to it.'' One evening, Jose and his wife, Clarissa, had me over for dinner. Pepe was there, along with his two younger sisters and his girlfriend, Ana, another Juarez transplant, who moved over after her uncle was killed. Their new place is a classic Texas ranch house, with exposed wood beams and a pool out back. Clarissa, who wears fashionable glasses and speaks English without a trace of an accent, spent part of her childhood in El Paso, where her family ran a Spanish-language movie house. The Yanars told me they always considered themselves proud citizens of Juarez. ''The Mexicans that have a lot of time in the U.S. . . . they think they're gringos,'' Jose said dismissively. But now they are trying to figure out where they fit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the kitchen, someone piped up with the day's news: the political authorities had proposed to change the name of their hometown to Heroica Ciudad Juarez -- adding the word ''heroic,'' as if the appellation could make it true. There was a chorus of scoffing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Never mind,'' Ana said. ''We're not from Juarez anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes I wonder what El Paso lives off of,'' says Tony Payan, a professor of political science at UTEP. To a large extent, the answer is that it subsists off of Juarez. There's no real agriculture in its arid climate, and much of the city's once-significant industrial sector has closed down or moved away. El Paso's income and education levels have long been far below the national average. For the last few decades, the city's prosperity has been tied to production in the maquiladoras, the outsourced manufacturing industry across the border, and to public-sector employment in border security, law enforcement and at the fast-growing Army base at Fort Bliss -- institutions that are all there, to one degree or another, because of the city's proximity to Mexico. Then, of course, there's the hidden economy of the narcotics trade, which generates anywhere between $6 billion and $36 billion a year, depending on whose estimates you credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard Campbell, an anthropologist who studies drug trafficking, told me that the relationship between the two cities ''is both symbiotic and parasitic.'' When I asked him who was the parasite, he gave me an amused look -- silly outsider -- and said, ''The U.S.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local lore holds that one city was built on the other's misfortune. Major battles of the Mexican Revolution were plotted in El Paso and fought in Juarez. When warfare broke out in the streets of the Mexican city in 1911, a newspaperman later recalled, ''El Paso was delighted and moved en masse down to the riverbank to watch the scrap.'' El Paso's bank deposits increased by 88 percent in just a few years, as merchants made fortunes supplying all the warring parties. One hardware store sold barbed wire to the Mexican government and wire cutters to the rebels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Dorado Romo, a historian and the author of ''Ringside Seat to a Revolution,'' compares El Paso in that formative period to Berlin during the Cold War. One downtown building served as a revolutionary headquarters, while counterspies kept an office down the street. The rebel leader Pancho Villa, a teetotaler, held court over ice cream at the Elite Confectionery. Many noncombatants also took shelter on the American side of the river. By 1920, El Paso had doubled in size, to around 80,000 people. Displaced members of the Mexican elite drove a housing boom, opened stores and named a street for Porfirio Diaz, their deposed dictator. One revolutionary would later write that the border region was filled with ''men without a country . . . who are foreigners in both lands.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Romo's book appeared in 2005, there has been a surge of local interest in this era, coinciding with the election of a generation of young reformist politicians who appreciate what came out of it: some architecturally significant buildings, a wise city plan and the dim memory of a moment when El Paso played a momentous role. This has a lot to do with why, when Juarez erupted, the mood in El Paso wasn't entirely mournful. ''We're stuck in this circular historical pattern,'' says Veronica Escobar, a 41-year-old New York University graduate who is El Paso County's judge, its highest elected official. ''Here we are 100 years later, and again there's this horrible, bloody war happening again across from us.'' And yet Escobar's sympathies, like those of many others, are tempered by a sense of recapitulated opportunity. ''We benefit,'' she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">El Paso has been among the nation's best economic performers through the recession -- its gains coming, in part, because of Mexico's losses. ''In the short run, there has been a positive influx of capital, people and money into El Paso and, for that matter, other border cities,'' says Roberto Coronado, an economist with the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</span>. ''That's driving business on this side of the border.'' Defying stereotypes, refugees like Jose Yanar have arrived with affluent appetites and expectations about their influence. (Even Juarez's recently departed mayor, everyone knows, kept a home on the north side of the border.) Yanar and some friends decided to band together to start a civic organization called La Red, or the Network. They began gathering every week for breakfast at Paco Wong's, a restaurant run by a prominent Chinese family from Juarez, quickly exciting the interest of politicians on both sides of the border. ''We're telling them that there's no need to build walls,'' says the group's president, a magazine publisher named Jose Luis Mauricio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's exactly what happened 100 years ago,'' said Robert O'Rourke. A lanky Web developer, universally known as Beto, his childhood nickname, O'Rourke was elected to the El Paso City Council six years ago, at age 31. He met me one Friday at a bar in Union Plaza, part of a warehouse-district redevelopment that was, until recently, considered a boondoggle. ''For 15 years, nothing happened -- until Juarez closed down,'' he said. But O'Rourke disagrees with those who foresee another profiteering golden era. A stable Mexico, he said, represents the ''source of the greatest opportunity and potential'' for El Paso. ''Some people have the impression that this is a boon,'' O'Rourke told me, ''but really it's a zero-sum game.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juarez's murders are terrifying in both their sheer numbers and their grisly impunity: beheaded bodies are left on busy streets, hit men open fire into crowds in broad daylight. ''The problem is that our crime is disorganized,'' one prominent Mexican lawyer told me. ''If it was organized crime, we wouldn't see it.'' Though the lawyer's family stays in El Paso, he is part of the dwindling population that still crosses to Juarez for work. Like many others, he takes steps to limit his exposure, traveling at irregular times, exchanging his <span class="companylink">BMW</span> for a less conspicuous car. (For obvious reasons, he wouldn't allow his name in this article.) Everyone who spends time in Juarez seems to espouse a contradictory theory of risk management: I'm blond; they won't touch an American. . . . I look Mexican; I blend in. . . . I drive a very fast car. . . . I only take taxis. . . . I look harmless. . . . I look tough. . . . Don't worry, everyone knows who I am. . . . Don't worry, nobody knows who I am.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over coffee, I asked the leaders of La Red what strategies they used to manage the threats. Yanar looked incredulously at Mauricio, who still keeps an office in Juarez, and joked, ''He likes the dangers.'' Mauricio lay a rosary on the table. ''This is my policy,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not a prayerful man, so the first time I crossed the border, I did it in what everyone said was the safest possible way. I went over with a maquiladora executive. Pancho Uranga is a voluble, buzz-cut man who works with Foxconn, a Taiwanese maker of electronic components, and helped establish its brand-new plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now we're in the U.S.,'' Uranga said, striding over the invisible line. ''And right now, we're in Mexico. Nobody's gonna check your passport.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And no one did. On the Mexican side of the Santa Teresa border crossing, just outside El Paso, we hopped into a white van that was waiting for us and drove right past a couple of disinterested border guards. Foxconn chose to build its facility out on the far western outskirts of Juarez. ''Initially it was hell,'' Uranga said. ''There was nothing out here but rabbits and snakes.'' The maquiladoras have been largely untouched by the violence, but isolation added an extra buffer. ''It gave us a clean piece of paper so we can design everything from scratch,'' he said. ''You feel secure here, versus driving through the city in today's environment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Asian company opening a plant in North America marks a reversal, to say the least. The maquiladora industry grew in response to a United States government decision in the 1960s to drastically limit the number of Mexicans crossing the border for seasonal farm work. Mass unemployment followed, and Mexico enticed American manufacturers to new free-trade zones along the border, shielded from United States taxes, unions and wage requirements. The industry crested shortly after Nafta was ratified, and for the last decade it has been struggling to compete with the even less expensive factories in Asia. The financial crisis vaporized about a third of Juarez's 250,000 factory jobs in less than two years. But with costs and inflation rising in China, Mexico is once again able to market a comparative advantage. There is a catch, however. ''Putting plants into places where drug lords are fighting is not something that companies want to do,'' says Harold Sirkin, a senior partner with the <span class="companylink">Boston Consulting Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxconn's secure facility, which produces desktops and laptops for Dell, is like ''a prison with a campus,'' Uranga said. Its landscaped grounds are surrounded by walls and razor wire. Managers stay in adjacent dormitories while workers come in from surrounding areas on white school buses. Uranga said the pay at the plant was around the average for the maquiladora industry, about $80 a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uranga offered to give me an impromptu lesson on the workings of the border economy by driving into the colonias on the margins of Juarez. ''This is Lomas de Poleo,'' he said. Pedestrians were filtering onto the highway from unpaved streets lined with cinder-block houses. The area had been the center of unrest over mass evictions by wealthy landowners. Just up the road was Anapra, a concrete jumble of hillside shanties. ''It's the poorest area in Juarez,'' Uranga said. ''And it's the easiest place to pull labor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We reached a military checkpoint, where soldiers carrying machine guns were waving cars to the side of the road. ''Little by little,'' Uranga said, ''if you bring development, you bring security.'' To illustrate, he pointed to some hills and said, ''That's where they used to dump the girls.'' A decade ago, hundreds of women, many from the factories, turned up murdered around Juarez. Uranga claimed that such things were not happening in this area anymore. ''Why?'' he said. ''We built the road.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some doubt Uranga's theory that the outsourcing industry benefits the poor. They suggest that it's hardly a coincidence that plants like his and the drug industry exist side by side. ''To what extent does the very nature of the industry contribute to the patterns of social anomie and violence that we see in Juarez and elsewhere along the border?'' asked David Shirk of the Trans-Border Institute. The maquiladoras provide low-skilled jobs, but their existence has made Juarez a destination for the rootless and the desperate. This population appears to have been susceptible to the richer promises of the drug trade, as well as to the lure of illegal immigration to the United States, with its comparatively well-paid opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The migration of the last three decades, primarily driven by economic disparity, has left a permanent mark on America -- and Southwestern states like Texas most of all. Hispanics accounted for two-thirds of Texas's substantial growth over the last decade, according to Census figures, and now make up 38 percent of the state's population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Hispanic phenomenon in this country is totally underappreciated and underserved,'' Bill Sanders, an El Paso real estate investor, says. ''It's one of the main drivers for job and economic growth.'' An avuncular, white-haired grandee of the Texas borderland, Sanders is one of the most influential figures in a region ruled by mercantile interests. (He is, incidentally, also the father-in-law of Beto O'Rourke, the El Paso politician.) Among many holdings, Sanders is a founder of the Verde Group, which owns millions of square feet of industrial property in and around El Paso and Juarez, and 22,000 mostly undeveloped acres facing the Foxconn plant from the American side. Sanders is bullish on the border's potential. ''It's such a powerful generator of value,'' he says. ''The United States is the largest consumer market in the world, and the most efficient place in the world to produce those goods is on the U.S.-Mexican border.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sanders made his name in Chicago real estate before moving back to his hometown of El Paso a decade ago with a notion about remaking the city's identity. ''In 2001, a group asked me to meet the mayor, and he wanted me to redevelop downtown,'' he told me. Back in Chicago, Sanders had been a member of the Commercial Club, a private organization that quietly influences the city's urban planning. So Sanders helped put together a similar organization called the Paso del Norte Group, which embarked on a hushed process of drawing up a plan for restaurants, loft apartments and a shopping center. When Sanders went public with the idea, though, and formed a private investment vehicle to buy up property, local advocates accused the developer of trying to bulldoze the Segundo Barrio, El Paso's old immigrant neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The controversy took on divisive overtones of race and class, especially after the Paso del Norte Group released its private membership list under pressure from activists and a news Web site. It included prominent family names from both El Paso and Juarez and was the clearest possible expression of the intermingled political and financial interests that have long dictated the course of development on the border. ''They marry each other, they socialize with each other,'' Tony Payan, of UTEP, says. ''For them, citizenship means nothing. The border does not exist.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sanders said his and his group's intentions were never nefarious. All he had wanted to create, he told me, was ''a civic system here that weaves together the whole city'' and that cultivated its high-level connections with Juarez. To show what he meant, he invited me into the desert with a group of four other businessmen, two Mexican and two American. Sanders set off behind the wheel of a pickup truck, while his Mexican friends -- a lawyer and the C.E.O. of a major food distributor -- trailed on A.T.V.'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We started near the Verde Group's industrial park in Santa Teresa and ended up at a ranch Sanders own in Columbus, N.M. In between was a flat, scrubby expanse of mostly public land, all cactuses and rocks, with little life in sight, other than jackrabbits. But Sanders had ambitious ideas. As we bounded down a dirt road that ran along the Union Pacific tracks, he talked up a new $400 million rail shipping facility that was opening next to Verde's property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suddenly, flashing lights appeared behind us. It was a Border Patrol agent in a truck, chasing behind the Mexican C.E.O. on his A.T.V., suspicious of our purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After IDs and explanations were produced, we continued on our way westward, ending up at Sanders's ranch in Columbus, a grungy border outpost that's famous for two things: being attacked by Pancho Villa a century ago and, earlier this year, having its mayor and police chief arrested for gunrunning to the cartels. We returned home along a two-lane road that hugged a low, metal barricade marking the border. Every few miles, we passed another white S.U.V., and someone in the car would mutter, ''La Migra,'' the colloquial name for the Border Patrol. The force has doubled in size around El Paso over the last few years, at the same time as the number of Mexicans trying to cross has dropped, meaning limited stimulation for those on watch. As we turned off the road to take a closer look at the wall, we passed an agent sleeping soundly behind the wheel of his vehicle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On our way back up from the borderline, the agent woke up, startled. He rolled down his window and asked, ''Where'd you guys come in through?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">El Paso's population is 80 percent Hispanic, but when the Juarez refugees began flooding in, the reaction from some quarters was far from brotherly. One day, Jose Yanar told me, a man came knocking on doors in his new neighborhood in El Paso. He presented a petition to one of Yanar's Mexican neighbors. ''He says: 'Can you sign this paper? These stupid Mexicans are coming here and buying houses.' '' Yanar was flabbergasted: in most of recessionary America, no one was buying houses, but in El Paso sales and prices have held fairly steady, in part because of people like him. He thought that would make Americans happy, but everywhere it seemed as if politicians were bent on driving Mexicans out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, conservatives were using the spectacle of violence in Mexico to push draconian immigration and border-security measures. Last spring, as Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, began flirting with a run for the Republican presidential nomination, he took Fox News's Greta Van Susteren on a trip down to the Rio Grande. He told her there was ''great terror on our southern border'' and called the status of security an ''absolute national disgrace.'' At Perry's urging, the Texas Legislature spent much of the spring debating a proposal to push local police units to enforce federal immigration laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure eventually failed, but it dominated the political discussion in the borderland, where people saw it was just one facet in a larger surge of xenophobia. To most people who actually live in El Paso, Perry's assertion that they are undefended is a bit of a joke. If anything, the city has the feel of an armed camp. Helicopters hover low over the Rio Grande, surveillance drones circle high above and there's the hulking border fence. In May, President Obama stood a few hundred feet from the border in El Paso and declared that the nation has ''more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history.'' When he mentioned the fence, the audience booed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting in the audience that day, shaded by a straw hat, was the Rev. Arturo Banuelas, pastor of the St. Pius X parish on the east side of El Paso. ''I was one of the ones booing,'' Father Banuelas later told me. He was disappointed by what he saw as Obama's ineffectual advocacy of immigration reform and his comparatively vigorous approach to enforcement. Deportations have increased under Obama, even as the drug conflict has worsened. Of the thousands of asylum claims filed by Mexicans last year, only 49 were granted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banuelas, whose family goes back many generations in the United States, has a creased face and a playful, academic intelligence; he earned a doctorate in Rome, writing his dissertation on liberation theology. He often marches for immigrant rights, and his ministry extends to offering practical advice to people trying to flee Juarez. His own 11-year-old nephew was killed when carjackers attacked his family on a vacation in Mexico. One afternoon Banuelas led a singalong and prayers with a group of children between the ages of about 6 and 10. They were visiting his church from an immigration-detention center, where they were being held after being captured, unaccompanied by their parents, by the Border Patrol, often as smugglers led them through the desert. ''There was a baby, 2 years old, in this room -- her family was killed in Juarez,'' Banuelas told me. The child was found by herself, on a bus, and no one knows how she got there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banuelas told me that what the distant politicians don't understand is that the violence has already spilled over, in ways you can't seal off with a fence. Familial networks in his parish span the border; he has conducted many funerals for victims, including his nephew. But almost as troubling as Mexico's conflict was America's reaction. ''There is this way of talking about Mexicans coming over that promotes fear here,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly everyone I met in El Paso -- whether they spoke Spanish or English, were liberal or conservative, rich or poor -- told me the same thing: no one outside really understood this crisis they were living through. American politicians often talked about the evils of the cartels as if drugs were a purely Mexican business, instead of a thriving multibillion-dollar trade that involves two parties. A generation-long effort to stanch the flow of drugs and desperate people across the border had reached its logical endpoint, the approach favored by ancient empires: the raising of a wall. The barrier wasn't very likely to overturn the law of supply and demand, but it did serve as a useful symbol of the process of alienation, a closing-off of lives and minds, along the line it traces. The peculiar fluidity of the borderland was drying up as it was slowly sapped away by two unappeasable forces: the cartels on one side, the reactionaries on the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the tattered ideal of a world without borders holds great power. One day in February at Casa de Nacimiento, a group of 10 pregnant women sat sprawled on the floor of a carpeted room, listening as a woman named Luz Chavez gave an introductory birthing class. Chavez is Linda Arnold's most trusted assistant and someone who understands the unique needs of the clientele. Though she was born in America -- her mother was a Casa de Nacimiento client -- she still commutes across from Juarez. In addition to the usual explanations about fetal development and diet, Chavez crisply covered the rules for navigating the law's gray areas: visas, how to respond to probing questions at the border, handling the application for a birth certificate. ''We try to teach them that they can have an American baby, but they have to pay for it,'' Chavez said afterward, adding with a nervous smile, ''we're not doing anything illegal -- so far.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were troubling rumblings, though, emanating from Washington and Austin. In one of the most extreme expressions of nativist fury, conservative talk-show hosts and Tea Party politicians had taken to fulminating against ''anchor babies,'' suggesting that a horde of devious Mexican mothers was slipping into the United States to give birth and cheat the system. In reality, having American offspring is not a shortcut to naturalization -- children cannot petition for their parents to become permanent residents until they turn 21 -- but the misinformed rhetoric proved powerful. ''They're talking about these anchor babies, illegal immigrants, but these are not illegal immigrants,'' Arnold said. ''They are legally doing what they can do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I returned to Casa de Nacimiento in May, Arnold seemed weary of her newly controversial enterprise. In the months since my last visit, local authorities in San Gabriel, Calif., had closed down a maternity center catering to Chinese visitors, ostensibly for building-code violations, and Republicans in Congress and the Texas Legislature were proposing to curtail birthright citizenship, on constitutionally dubious grounds. Because they were not born in hospitals, some Casa de Nacimiento children were now finding their citizenship claims subjected to extreme scrutiny. And while Juarez's violence gave women every incentive to secure their children a U.S. passport, they still had to contend with the immediate obstacles of the border. Increased security meant long lines and uncomfortable waits for a woman in labor. ''It can be based on problems in Mexico with the narcos, it can be the U.S. Border Patrol, it can be both,'' Arnold said. The phenomenon that originally drew her to El Paso, the free flow of expectant mothers across the border, had given way to discouragement and ever-firmer demarcation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arnold said her client base had fallen about 50 percent from its peak a decade or so ago. The harshest blow was economic: Mexico's upheaval might be buoying El Paso's economy through the recession, but Juarez was suffering as manufacturing struggled and its population dispersed because of fear. ''People who were working at the maquilas for $50 or $70 a week are now part-timers at $30 a week,'' Arnold said. This illustrated something economists told me when they predicted that the stimulating jolt to El Paso was likely to be short-lived: the longer view of history suggests that the cities rise and fall together, if not always in perfect unison. Their fates can never be disentangled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, after running her business for 26 years and training more than 800 midwives, Arnold decided with great sadness to close it. Over the course of its existence, she estimates, Casa de Nacimiento delivered some 13,400 new Americans. ''They now have the best of both worlds,'' Arnold said. In a metropolis divided by a river, and so much else, the midwife had bequeathed them a bridge to the other side.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JAY ROOT   </div><div>1383 words</div><div>29 July 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>National Edition</div><div>17A</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One theme runs consistently throughout Gov. Rick Perry's political career: good timing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same might be said of his real estate deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Perry was not born into wealth, and while he has drawn relatively modest pay since 1985 as an elected official, he has made a small fortune on land transactions, some with the help of rich and politically connected friends. As the governor mulls a run for president, opponents and the news media are taking another look at his holdings and his tax returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Dell, the computer magnate, once bought a piece of property from Mr. Perry -- for almost four times what Mr. Perry had paid two years earlier. In 2001, the governor bought a piece of lakefront property from a longtime friend, State Senator Troy Fraser, Republican of Horseshoe Bay. Mr. Perry sold it six years later for a profit of $823,766, his biggest real estate gain ever, according to available records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, both Republican and Democratic critics have used the land deals -- and at least one stock trade involving the company of a top donor -- to suggest that Mr. Perry has traded on his connections to make money. But no one has found any wrongdoing, and Mr. Perry has said that all of his deals were above board. In 1996, Mr. Perry put much of his wealth into blind trusts, making it almost impossible to tell what he owns now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Martin, a Houston accountant who analyzed Mr. Perry's tax returns going back to 1991 for The Texas Tribune, said Mr. Perry had fallen into a handful of deals producing some big paydays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Based on the information that we've been given,'' Mr. Martin said, ''it looked like Governor Perry's net worth did increase significantly while he's been in office. The market was going up; timing was very much in people's favor. So it might not be unusual, but because he is a political official, it is subject to more scrutiny.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perry aides have said the governor benefited only from good business sense and a once-red-hot real estate market, all the while meeting disclosure requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax records are not subject to mandatory disclosure, but Mr. Perry has voluntarily released them for most of the time he has been in elected office. Mr. Perry, or at least his trust, has also lost some money along the way, most notably during the 2008 economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he was first elected to the Legislature, in 1984, Mr. Perry, from rural Haskell County, north of Abilene, was still farming cotton and ranching cattle. In 1987, he and his wife, Anita, reported an adjusted gross income of $45,000. As a state legislator, considered a part-time job, Mr. Perry was entitled to a salary of $7,200 a year plus expenses. He made about $85,000 annually as agriculture commissioner (1991-99) and now draws $150,000 a year as governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his almost three decades in public office, Mr. Perry's biggest gains in income have come from buying and selling land. Since the early 1990s, when Mr. Perry began serving as a statewide elected official, the transactions have helped him earn about $2 million in pre-tax profits, according to interviews, public records and news accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1995, Mr. Perry sold a 9.3-acre tract in Austin to Mr. Dell, with Mike Toomey, an influential Texas lobbyist and longtime confidant, representing him at the sale. Mr. Dell bought the property for $465,000 and got access to important municipal sewage infrastructure. Mr. Perry had bought the land for a reported $122,000 in 1993, giving him a $343,000 profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A little more than a year later, acting on a tip from Gary Bradley, the flashy Austin developer, Mr. Perry bought 60 acres southwest of Austin. He sold the tract less than three years later for a profit of $239,000. Mr. Bradley's real estate empire went into bankruptcy in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to available records, Mr. Perry's most lucrative land deal was a 2007 transaction in which he sold a prime piece of real estate on the shores of Lake L.B.J. near Austin for $1.14 million at the height of the market. Records show he had bought the 0.68-acre tract for $314,770 in 2001 from Mr. Fraser, the state senator, who had acquired it and a nearby tract in the resort town of Horseshoe Bay. Mr. Perry's office has described the transaction as ''completely at arm's length.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lot Mr. Perry bought is in an area of Horseshoe Bay known as The Peninsula, the town's ''most prestigious and exclusive waterfront address,'' according to a description on the Horseshoe Bay Resort Realty Web site. Resort literature described the property, with 10-foot-high stone walls around it, as one of 10 lots taken from the estate of Horseshoe Bay's founder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After selling the land in 2007, Mr. Perry reported adjusted gross income of $1,092,810, while paying $195,023 in taxes. It was the best year, in terms of income, that Mr. Perry has disclosed so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The governor's office did not respond to requests for the Perrys' 2010 income tax return and did not volunteer the market value of their blind trusts. In 2009, the governor's office pegged the value of the trust at $896,000. The Perrys reported income of $200,370 in 2009, which included the $65,000 from Ms. Perry's work as a consultant for the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from the money he made on land deals, Mr. Perry reported a profit of $38,000 in 1996 after selling shares of <span class="companylink">Kinetic Concepts Inc</span>., a hospital equipment company founded by one of his most generous donors, James Leininger of San Antonio, the vocal proponent of school vouchers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of Mr. Perry's publicly traded stocks, and some other assets, have been transferred into his blind trust, records show. The trust has provided at least $600,000 in income to Mr. Perry since 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has not all been rosy. The blind trust Mr. Perry created in 1996 reported a half-million dollars in losses in 2008, in what Mr. Martin, the accountant, said was most likely caused by a sell-off during the market downturns that year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He's had good timing, and he's had bad timing,'' Mr. Martin said. ''When the stock market went down, it looks like he pulled out of the stock market, or at least his blind trust did, and he has a significant capital loss now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Perry's most recent personal financial statement, filed with the Texas Ethics Commission earlier this year and covering 2010, also reflects a loss, reported as less than $5,000, on the sale of a house the Perrys owned in College Station, where their daughter attended college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One area that has grown on Mr. Perry's financial disclosures in recent years is gifts received by the couple. The latest disclosure included seven pages of them, up from three in each of the two previous years. They included a hat, transportation, lodging and hunting trips from various contributors and friends. Ms. Perry received a gift last year of ''hair products'' from Farouk Shami, maker of the popular CHI flat iron and at one point in 2010 a Democratic contender for Mr. Perry's job. Mr. Shami later dropped out and endorsed the governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boots seemed to be the most popular gift. The records show that since 2007 Mr. Perry has received 10 pairs from a variety of donors, including several from the famed Houston boot maker Rocky Carroll.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- First-time claims for state unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, dropping below the important 400,000 level for the first time since April, according to a government report on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, a private trade group said sales of existing homes rose unexpectedly in June, and both statistics gave investors a reason for optimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobless claims dropped 24,000, to a seasonally adjusted 398,000, the Labor Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop below the 400,000 level that is normally associated with stable job growth will be welcome news for the economy after a recent string of weak data. Employment growth stumbled badly in May and June, with the increase in nonfarm payrolls totaling only 43,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast that claims would fall to 415,000. The previous week's figure was revised to 422,000 from 418,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government was expected to report on Friday that the economy grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the second quarter, according to a Reuters survey, after a 1.9 percent pace in the first three months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales of existing homes unexpectedly rose in June from May and rose sharply from a year ago, data from a real estate trade group showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in June, was up 2.4 percent to 90.9 from 88.8 in May. The index was up 19.8 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters ahead of the report were expecting pending home sales to fall 2.0 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association's senior economist, Lawrence Yun, said despite the uptick, the latest monthly reading showed that tight credit and economic uncertainty were still constricting the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The best way to ensure a more solid recovery in housing is to simply return to normal, sound credit standards so more creditworthy home buyers can get a mortgage,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends, fell 8,500, to 413,750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A total of 7.65 million people were claiming unemployment benefits in the week ended July 9 under all programs, up 320,152 from the previous week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are roughly 400 million square feet of commercial real estate in Manhattan, an amount equal to more than 9,000 acres. For the last three decades, as the office market grew and matured, brokers and tenants began slicing that space into classes that signaled a building's amenities and location and, of course, the rent that its landlord could charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, four classifications are used for office buildings: trophy properties, which are mostly new construction that offer tenants the latest technologies, best locations and most exclusive tenancies; Class A, where the vintage may be somewhat older but the location or landmark architecture demands above-average rents; and Class B, mostly on Midtown side streets or peripheral locations, with average rents, services and building systems. Rounding it out are Class C properties, which are often simply Class B buildings that lack services. Often, Class C buildings will be upgraded to achieve higher rents and make better use of valuable real estate or be converted into residential units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trophy office towers make up 9 percent of the Manhattan market, Class A buildings make up 53 percent and Class B 26 percent; the remainder is Class C, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield. In the boroughs, the brokerage firm tracks roughly 17 million square feet of office space in Brooklyn, about half of which is Class A, and 7 million square feet of mostly Class A and B office space in Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is no industrywide standard, and deciding whether a building fits into one group or another is more art than science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a universal desire for a classification system that is somewhat objective, but unfortunately, it is really a very subjective process,'' said David Goldstein, an executive vice president at the brokerage firm Studley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it varies from firm to firm, among the criteria brokers use are age, location, curb appeal, tenancy, building infrastructure and ownership. The labels help brokers categorize average rents, and vacancy and absorption rates, and are often used as a form of shorthand in marketing space to tenants. The city's Finance Department also relies on the class system to help assessors determine real estate taxes and property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trophies</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trophy buildings are often the easiest to spot because they tend to be the newest and most technologically advanced. Both 1 Bryant Park and 7 World Trade Center, completed in 2009 and 2006, respectively, are considered trophies, and are among the country's leaders in environmentally sustainable buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some trophies have climbed to their position through gut renovations. <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, for example, lists 545 Madison Avenue, which underwent a $90 million renovation in 2008, as a trophy property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only thing that exists from before is the concrete and steel,'' said David Sigman, executive vice president and principal at LCOR, which acquired a 75-year ground lease on the property, at East 55th Street, in 2006. It is 60 percent leased, with rents in the range of the low-$70s per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some trophies do not require such extensive work to keep current. The Solow Building at 9 West 57th Street has retained its position as one of the most exclusive Manhattan office towers despite its 1974 vintage. It commands rents from $100 to $200 per square foot and has an exclusive roster of tenants, including the private equity firm <span class="companylink">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company</span> and the corporate offices of the design house Chanel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Class A</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Class A skyscrapers are characterized as well maintained, with stellar ownership, in prime neighborhoods with high-credit tenants, but are generally not of recent vintage. Rockefeller Center, for example, was built in the 1930s, but its location, the reputation of its owner, Tishman Speyer, the quality of its retail roster and the fame of the Rockefeller Center brand have kept the office complex well within the Class A status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while trophies are usually designated as such by acclaim, Class A properties can sometimes evoke disagreement, particularly when the location is a focus. Park Avenue, for example, in the heart of Midtown is often considered reason enough to label the buildings there Class A properties. But 230 Park Avenue and 250 Park Avenue, for example, were built in the 1920s, and some real estate experts argue that the buildings fail to live up to Class A standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Do they have updated common areas that feel plush and luxurious, do they have the services?'' said Marisa Manley, the president of Commercial Tenant Real Estate Representation, a brokerage firm. ''Or are these buildings really just fabulously located space on Park Avenue?'' While some may say the buildings are lackluster, brokers do mostly consider them Class A properties, and their rents are consistent with other top-tier buildings in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, buildings can move up the classification rung. The Empire State Building spent decades in the lower classifications, but now many firms consider it Class A. Since 2006, it has undergone a $550 million renovation and has shrunk its roster list from 561 tenants to less than 190, seeking to attract bigger companies. Among the companies that have recently moved in and helped raise the building's stature is the construction company Skanska, the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> and the social network LinkedIn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Class B</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key factor in Class B buildings is often the presence of many smaller tenants, as well as a prewar vintage. Class B buildings that are in Midtown are nearly always on the side streets, and the bulk of them can be found in Midtown South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The way I look at it is usually based on amenities,'' says Jeffrey Buslik, a director at Adams &amp; Company, a brokerage firm that has many Class B listings. ''In a Class A property there may be a concierge, but in a B building, there is someone at the door, but that is the extent of the lobby services.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, APF Properties and <span class="companylink">Prudential Real Estate</span> Investors acquired 28 West 44th Street, a Class B building close to Grand Central Terminal. The new ownership is working on a $12 million capital improvement program to provide tenants with prebuilt spaces, upgraded elevators and windows and new bathrooms, as well as other services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We like Class B properties because they are often in the best locations, but still provide tenants with an affordable alternative,'' said Ken Aschendorf, a partner at APF Properties. Rents in the building range from mid-$40 to $50 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Class C</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Class C properties tend to be Class B buildings with fewer services, like no attendant in the lobby and only a superintendent to maintain upkeep, industry experts say. There are only a handful of Class C buildings in Manhattan, because ''if a building gets too far down on the food chain, it can't compete effectively,'' said Robert L. Freedman, chairman of Colliers International in New York. ''In these cases, the highest and best use for the site is often converting the building into residential.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the financial district in Lower Manhattan, for example, many of the Class C office buildings have been converted into condominiums and rentals. Among the most recent conversion projects are 70 Pine Street and 116 John Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all firms use the classification system. <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, one of the largest brokerage firms, eschews the traditional class system in favor of dividing office buildings geographically and by size or age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, it will focus on Midtown buildings that are at least 150,000 square feet or those that are prewar, built before 1944.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Class A, Class B system is arbitrary, so we prefer to base our research on location, size and year built,'' said Travis Yuengst, the head of Manhattan research for <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>. ''We also tailor our research to landlords' needs, so it is very customizable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For tenants, the building classification can often be an afterthought. ''It's never where the discussion starts when you are talking with tenants,'' said Ms. Manley. ''Tenants generally think in terms of where they want to be geographically, then they think in terms of the image they want to project.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it can be a sort of shorthand. ''If a tenant tells me that they are looking for Class A space,'' she said, ''I understand that they are telling me they need great-looking space, that image is important to them.''.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the United States rose slightly for the second consecutive month in May, but the real estate market still has a long way to go before a recovery, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index, a closely watched measure of home prices, was up 1 percent compared with April, according to the broadest measure of data tracking 20 cities. Prices rose in 16 of the cities; they fell in Detroit, Las Vegas and Tampa, Fla., and were unchanged in Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, in Census Bureau data from the Commerce Department for June, the median sales price for a new home increased 5.8 percent in June to $235,200. Prices rose 7.2 percent year over year, the agency said. Sales of new single-family houses in June were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 312,000, according to estimates, a rise of 1.6 percent from June 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in May for Case-Shiller came after the index edged up a fractional 0.6 percent in April, which was the first time prices were higher in eight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the trend in the 20-city composite index, while positive, was attributed to seasonal factors, and analysts were hesitant to read too much into one or two months of data. Demand is typically stronger in the spring, and continued weakness was evident in other barometers of housing health, such as contract cancellations, tightened lending standards and sales of new homes in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have now seen two consecutive months of generally improving prices; however, we might have a long way to go before we see a real recovery,'' said David M. Blitzer, the chairman of the index committee at S.&amp; P. home price indexes. ''Sustained increases in home prices over several months and better annual results need to be seen before we can confirm real estate market recovery,'' he said in a statement released with the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data showed that prices in Detroit, Las Vegas and Tampa reached new lows, down nearly 50 percent or more since the peaks of 2005-6, the survey shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall index in May was down compared with May 2010, by 4.5 percent. That reflected a decline in prices in 19 of the 20 metropolitan areas when compared with the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The District of Columbia was the area with the only annual price increase, while Minneapolis, where home prices were up 2.6 percent in May and 0.1 percent in April, had the biggest fall in prices from May last year, with an 11.7 percent drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara T. Jandric, the president of Edina Realty in Minneapolis, said that the drop from last year reflected prices of many foreclosed homes. But in recent months the profile of houses being sold was starting to grow sounder, with fewer foreclosure sales as a percentage of the whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We still have quite a few of those sales in our market, but we see that we maybe hit our peak,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the firm has noticed more buyers on the higher end of the market, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So for the first time in many, many years, in that segment of the market we are seeing shortages of listings,'' she said. ''For us, it is another glimmer of hope that the market is really slowly, slowly trying to come back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said that the spring uptick started in April and was likely to dwindle by October, when weak demand typically drags down home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, other variables in the economy are deflating hopes for a housing rebound, including a struggling jobs market in which the unemployment rate is at 9.2 percent and consumer confidence is at depressed levels, said Chris G. Christopher Jr., senior principal economist for IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things do not look very favorable on the housing front since the employment situation has taken a turn for the worse in May and June,'' he said in a research note. ''Going forward, the Case-Shiller indexes are likely to post increases during the home-buying season, and then turn down again.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selling real estate in New York has long involved its own sort of code. ''Quiet'' means dark, back-of-the-building; ''cozy'' means small; and ''flexible'' means ''not really,'' as in the ''flex 1BR'' that is actually a studio with a nook. But as developers seek to wring every last bit of space out of their projects, another term has cropped up more and more: ''rec room,'' meaning an underground space that is not legally a bedroom, although many people use it that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to be confused with common spaces open to all residents in apartment buildings, these are finished, underground rooms in ground-floor dwellings that the city does not consider habitable space. Sometimes they are carved out of the cellars of old brownstones, sometimes they are excavated from deep in the ground of new condominiums, but they often come with a garden or an patio and add valuable square footage at a discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a new condo at 174 Jackson Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, for example, Grand Street Development created two first-floor duplexes with high-ceilinged rec rooms below, offering access to private gardens. The larger of the two, a 1,245-square-foot one-bedroom, is on the market for $749,000. On the fourth floor, an 832-square-foot two-bedroom duplex with a terrace is on the market for $726,000, a comparable price but about $270 more per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You get the most bang for your buck with these kinds of apartments,'' said David Maundrell, president of Aptsandlofts.com, which is marketing the property on Jackson Street. ''The city considers it uninhabitable space, but there are different ways and different approaches developers have taken to make the space quite nice.'' At 174 Jackson, for instance, the lower level has eight-and-a-half-foot ceilings, so it does not feel like a stereotypical basement lair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Mr. Maundrell said, the space does not count against the overall floor area limit for a project and can allow developers to construct buildings with greater square footage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clifford Finn, director of new development marketing at Citi Habitats, said that the rec room could make a ground-floor apartment, which is often more difficult to sell, more desirable. ''It's one thing when you're in a brownstone and someone wants the first floor because it has the garden in the back -- that's O.K.,'' he said. ''But when you're in a high-rise-type building, being on the first floor for some people is a stigma, and it's harder to get premiums for first-floor apartments. So anything you can do to increase their marketability, even if it means giving them the rec room with it, it suddenly becomes a real value play for someone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because these spaces are not legally intended for sleeping, they can have bathrooms no larger than 5 feet by 5 feet, and cannot have a shower or a tub, but many developers -- even those who have not put in a bathroom at all -- install plumbing sufficient for a full bathroom in case a resident wants to put one in later. Mr. Maundrell recalled a buyer in a new development who put a shower into her half-bath, but was required to remove it when Buildings Department inspectors, examining the building to renew its temporary certificate of occupancy, discovered it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People play with fire when they do that,'' Mr. Maundrell said. ''I tell people, what you choose to do with the space is up to you, but what I'm selling you is a one-bedroom apartment that has a recreation space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, square footage is square footage, whatever purpose it may ultimately serve -- bedroom, home office, den, storage, even, yes, recreation. The Buildings Department calls these spaces, which are 50 percent or more below grade, accessory, on the theory that they are add-ons to the larger residential space upstairs, said Shahn Andersen, a developer who is active in converting Brooklyn brownstones to condos. Mr. Andersen carved a rec room out of half of the cellar for the garden apartment at 415 Clermont Avenue in Fort Greene, listed at $469,000 through Corcoran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The department generally frowns upon making accessory space larger than the main living space, Mr. Andersen said. The prohibition on using the space for sleeping, he said, was a vestige of the old tenement law, a corrective to the bad old days when slum landlords would pack as many people as possible into small, boxy rooms, with no consideration for light, air or the ability to get out quickly in a fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Disease ran rampant because things would fester and it was unhealthy for everyone,'' Mr. Andersen said. ''Without proper egress or sprinklers or fire protection, you get incidents like a few years ago in the Bronx,'' he said, referring to a fire in 2007 in which a woman and nine children died. At the same time, he said, the law does not necessarily seem to fit every situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are legitimate reasons why the Department of Buildings doesn't want you packing people into basements,'' Mr. Andersen said, ''but is it such a crime when you've got a two-family and you want to put Grandma down in the basement?''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8:46 p.m. Updated</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once again, investors have caught Internet fever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Zillow, the online real estate information company, gained nearly 79 percent in its debut on the Nasdaq stock market on Wednesday, closing at $35.77. The company, which set its initial public offering price at $20, soared as high as $60 when trading began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first-day gains in Zillow echoed those of the social network LinkedIn, which more than doubled from its offering price in May, and Yandex, known as the <span class="companylink">Google</span> of Russia, which jumped 55 percent a few days later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are awaiting initial public offerings from Groupon, the social buying site; <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>, the creator of the online game FarmVille; and ultimately <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors' enthusiasm for Internet stocks this year has raised questions about whether this boom could be repeat of the 1990s technology bubble, setting investors up for a fall. In one instance, <span class="companylink">Renren</span>, a Chinese social networking site, jumped as much as 71 percent on its first day on the New York Stock Exchange in May, but its shares are now trading well below their offering price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in a sign of nervousness, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, one of the underwriters of LinkedIn's initial public offering, downgraded its rating on the company's shares on Monday, calling them overvalued. Despite a retreat after the downgrade, LinkedIn still trades at more than twice its offering price of $45.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have not been totally indiscriminate in their quest for Internet stocks. In June, for instance, shares of <span class="companylink">Pandora Media</span>, a popular but unprofitable online music service, gained only 8.9 percent in their debut and later fell below their offering price before recovering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow did receive special treatment in its market debut, as it entered the rarefied club of publicly traded corporations with single-letter ticker symbols.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow, which trades as Z, is the first single-letter stock to trade on the Nasdaq stock market. It joins such blue-chip corporations as the <span class="companylink">Ford Motor Company</span> (F), Visa (V), and <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> (C), all of which trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Zillow, the last company to trade under the letter Z was the now-defunct Woolworth's department store chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob McCooey, Nasdaq's head of listings, said on Wednesday that getting Zillow a single-letter ticker symbol required lobbying the New York Stock Exchange, which had put it on a so-called perpetual list of symbols it had reserved for future listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For Zillow, it's really about their branding,'' Mr. McCooey said. ''They felt like this was going to make them unique.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies seeking one-letter ticker symbols should hurry: I, J, Q, U and W are still available, though all five are on the New York Stock Exchange's reserved list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They don't share very much with us,'' Mr. McCooey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other Internet companies, Zillow had outsize expectations about its initial public offering. Originally, the company set its price range at $12 to $14 a share, later increasing it to $16 to $18 before finally setting it at $20. The company raised more than $69.2 million from the offering, valuing it at as much as $550 million. With Wednesday's 78.9 percent increase, Zillow has a market value of nearly $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as with peers, Zillow is still struggling to be profitable. The company reported a loss of $6.8 million in 2010, according to its recent regulatory filing. Still, the company is growing. Zillow's revenue increased 74 percent, to $30.5 million. This year, Zillow entered into a partnership with Yahoo Real Estate and acquired Postlets, a real estate listing service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> was the underwriter on Zillow's initial public offering.</p>

The company had to petition the New York Stock Exchange, which has reserved the single-letter symbols, to get it. Five single-letter tickers are currently available.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Fewer people bought previously owned homes in June, a private group said Wednesday, putting this year on pace to be the worst for sales since the housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said home sales fell 0.8 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.77 million homes. That is far below the six million homes a year rate that economists say represents a healthy housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June's decrease was the third consecutive monthly decline in home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the first six months of 2011, the number of sales is behind last year's 4.91 million homes sold -- the weakest sales in 13 years. Sales have fallen in four of the last five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association said a record number of people who signed contracts canceled their deals last month. And first-time buyers are becoming a smaller share of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes held steady in June, while sales of condominiums declined 7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bigger down payments, tougher lending rules, high debt and a shortage of desirable starter homes are deterring many would-be buyers. Even some people with good credit and enough money for a down payment are delaying because they are worried that prices will keep falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It all goes back to uncertainty about the future and hiring,'' said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers made up just 31 percent of sales in June, when normally they make up about half of all home sales. First-time buyers are valuable in the housing market because they tend to keep their homes for years and because their purchases allow sellers to move to more expensive homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 16 percent of home deals were canceled last month, four times the number in May and the highest level since such record keeping began more than a year ago. A sale is not final until a mortgage is closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price rose nearly 9 percent in June from May, to $184,300. The increase was mainly a result of seasonal factors that led to a big increase in prices in the Northeast and West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were uneven across the country. In May, sales rose 0.5 percent in the West and 1 percent in the Midwest and fell 1.7 percent in the South and 5.2 percent in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of unsold homes rose slightly in June to 3.77 million. At last month's sales pace, it would take 9.5 months to sell those homes.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of new construction of private homes in the United States last month was the highest since January, according to government figures released on Tuesday. Economists, however, warned that the sector had still not stabilized for a full recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders broke ground at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 629,000 units in June, a rise of more than 14 percent compared with the previous month and a rate that was 16.7 percent higher than June 2010, the Department of Commerce reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the highest since January, when construction starts came in at a 636,000-unit annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers are used as an indicator of future economic activity because of their implications for consumer spending, hiring, housing inventory, prices and other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the data is also volatile, subject to seasonal and other influences. A report on the statistics from Capital Economics economists said that the June survey reflected the severe weather in the previous months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's increase ''is not the start of a significant and sustained surge in home building,'' the report said. ''Instead, it reflects a rebound in activity after the unusually severe tornados and floods depressed starts in both April and May.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate for construction starts on single-family homes was 453,000 in June, up 9.3 percent from May, while the rate for buildings with five units or more was 170,000, up 31.8 percent, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also said that permits for new construction, an indicator of future activity, rose by 2.5 percent from May to a seasonally adjusted rate of 624,000 in June. It was up 6.7 percent compared with June 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within that category, permits for multifamily units rose 6.9 percent to a 217,000 annual rate, the highest level since October 2008. The category was up in the South, West and Midwest, but down in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For once in a long time, there was some good news in this report,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight. ''The market for multifamily homes is coming back to life -- very slowly -- but the foundations are in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But this is partly because the single-family market is falling so badly people are inclined to rent,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey also showed that completion of new homes took place at a rate of 535,000, which was 1.7 percent higher than in May. With a glut of new homes already on the market, adding to the inventory would tend to dampen prices, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The addition of new supply to the housing market isn't really constructive insofar as housing prices are concerned, but any uptick in new-home construction should offer some relief on the employment front,'' said Kevin H.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT first glance, 255 Hudson Street looks like a typical SoHo condominium, with a soaring glass facade, million-dollar listings and a chic designer lobby. But despite having housed entertainment figures like Bethenny Frankel and Kirsten Dunst, this building has more in common with a conservative Park Avenue co-op than a celebrity-friendly downtown high rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condominium, just north of Canal Street, has a 13-page application that requires buyers to provide multiple years of tax returns, bank statements, and personal and business references. ''Tell me how this is much different than buying in a co-op?'' said Edward E. Longley, a senior vice president at City Connections Realty, who represented an Italian man who bought a one-bedroom in the building earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a foreigner, the buyer lacked much of the necessary documentation and had to spend weeks having his paperwork translated into English and converted into dollars before he could close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I now tell all my clients that condo applications are simply co-op applications with the word 'condo' slapped on them,'' Mr. Longley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Adler, the board president at 255 Hudson Street, who is also the chief executive and founder of <span class="companylink">BizBash Media</span>, defended the building's vetting process. ''Our board application is as standard as they come for condos right now,'' he said. ''We do best practices and our management company advises us if they see any red flags.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the recession, an increasing number of condominium boards are hoping to weed out financially questionable buyers by requiring extensive application packages. Demands can include years' worth of federal tax returns, detailed lists of all assets and liabilities, several letters of references, and even board interviews. These buildings are waging a war of attrition, forcing potential residents to supply extensive documentation in the hopes that those who appear to be a financial risk will walk away of their own volition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing condominiums -- buying in a new building is still a relatively simple process -- are turning to this strategy because they have no real power to reject an applicant. The only tool at their disposal is the right of first refusal, which allows condominium boards that are unhappy with a buyer to purchase the unit themselves or designate a buyer for the same price. But few buildings can afford to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a bullying strategy -- condominium bullying,'' said Adam Leitman Bailey, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. ''If a condominium has a questionable buyer, they'll just keep asking for more and more information, dragging things out, until the buyer walks away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But condo boards say they are merely defending the interests of existing residents. In the downturn, many owners stopped paying common charges, and condominiums had little recourse to recoup their money. In case of a default, the city is first in line to recover outstanding real estate taxes or other charges, followed by the mortgage lender. The condominium is third in line, and usually all it can do is file a lien against the property and hope that it will be repaid when the apartment is sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the condominium's power is limited, it is a matter of fiduciary duty to find strong buyers, said Carl Seligson, the board president of Carnegie Hill Tower, at 40 East 94th Street. In any given month, about three apartments in the 180-unit building have not paid their monthly charges on time; none have defaulted, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the building's application requirements are tax returns, reference letters and a full description of all bank accounts and assets. It used to request board interviews, but ''we eliminated the interview process because we didn't think it was necessary,'' Mr. Seligson said. To limit transient residents, the building also requires that sublets be for at least one year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo board requirements run the gamut. At the <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center, where many buyers are foreign, it is not necessary to submit federal tax returns. The building does require that in addition to general liability insurance of $1 million, owners have a $5 million umbrella policy to cover any unforeseen costs, like an accidental fire or damage incurred during a renovation. On the Upper East Side, 215 East 80th Street has a 67-page application that requires three business reference letters and three personal reference letters for each applicant. And at Towers on the Park, a condominium at 110th Street and Central Park West, the application packet requires potential owners to list all assets and two years' worth of tax returns, to be certified by an accountant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some condo owners purchase through a limited liability company or other business entity, and in those cases a number of buildings require that the principal personally guarantee some expenses, such as monthly common charges and assessments. In other cases a condo may require a security deposit, said Ronald H. Gitter, a real estate lawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the past, condominiums would just ask for a simple financial statement,'' said Tamir Shemesh, a senior vice president at Corcoran, ''but now, due to the financial crisis, even the most exclusive luxury buildings are asking for supporting documents.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dani Bar-David was surprised that he had to submit reams of financial information when he bought two Manhattan condominiums as investments. Mr. Bar-David, who lives and works in New Jersey, bought units at 360 East 88th Street and 372 Central Park West, where the applications were 40 pages and 60 pages, respectively. ''They wanted so much information, you would think they were the ones who were going to own the apartments, not me,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vivek Kukar, a senior vice president at Rutenberg Realty who represented Mr. Bar-David in the purchases, agreed. ''The paperwork was extensive, especially given these were condominiums,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the condo boards, and not the management companies, that decide on the extent of the application package, said Dan Wurtzel, the president of Cooper Square Realty, which manages 372 Central Park West and 360 East 88th Street. ''Some buildings are very particular, while others that are mostly investor-owned have very general requirements,'' he said. On the whole, ''the general flavor right now is that condominiums are growing more cautious.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it is still the exception, some condominiums are executing the right of first refusal more readily, said Stuart M. Saft, the chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, a trade organization. ''In the last 12 to 18 months, I've seen at least 10 situations where the board bought the apartment or designated another buyer to buy it,'' said Mr. Saft, who is also the chairman of the law firm Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf's global real estate department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jacky Teplitzky, a managing director at Prudential Douglas Elliman, said, ''The brokerage community is in la-la land if they think that just because it's a condo, that every deal will go through.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she is representing sellers, Ms. Teplitzky makes potential buyers submit a detailed offer form, to ensure that they are financially secure. ''And every time, without fail, where the property is a condominium, the first thing we get is an angry telephone call'' from the buyer's broker ''telling us how dare we ask all this information.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it isn't just condos that are being more cautious. ''Co-ops also are strengthening their requirements,'' said Barbara Fox, president of Fox Residential Group. In fact, the only building types that don't have excessive application processes are new developments, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now in New York City, the only place that you are not being asked questions is when you buy in new construction,'' Ms. Teplitzky said. ''All they ask is for your name and your money.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By ALISON GREGOR   </div><div>1476 words</div><div>13 July 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an all-too-familiar pattern in many communities: artists discover an inexpensive, underdeveloped neighborhood and move in, only to be ousted from the area by soaring retail rents once it catches on in popularity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many argue that it happened in Greenwich Village, and most point to SoHo as the quintessential example of the phenomenon. Now, the same pattern may be occurring in Chelsea, where an explosion of residential development along the High Line is attracting retailers serving new residents -- retailers who are now competing for space with the hundreds of art galleries that are the backbone of the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some real estate experts say Chelsea's fate may be different, because a healthy number of the neighborhood's arts businesses had the foresight to buy their gallery and studio spaces, rather than lease them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The difference between SoHo and Chelsea is that so many artists, or even art companies or art investors, bought condos in Chelsea, so they actually made investments as opposed to leasing,'' said Barbara Byrne Denham, the chief economist at Eastern Consolidated, a commercial real estate brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that will preserve their spaces, and the flavor of Chelsea as kind of an art mecca,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Byrne Denham said there could be as many as 350 art galleries in Chelsea. Enough of them own their space that in a recent report on the commercial property sales market in Chelsea, Ms. Byrne Denham said, ''we had to separate them as their own property type.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I said, 'There's something in this that really stands out: the fact that so many properties sold as art studios, art condos and art buildings,' '' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, the sales volume in that sector peaked at about $105 million, then activity froze with the financial crisis, according to the report. Sales activity in arts-related properties recommenced in the latter half of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before 2007, arts-related sales activity in Chelsea was much slower, with about two properties changing hands a year between 2003 and 2006, Ms. Byrne Denham said. Much of that space is in former industrial buildings that were converted as artists and art galleries left SoHo in the mid-1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of Chelsea's arts sales in 2007 and 2008 were fed by one developer, Bass Associates L.L.C., which built the Chelsea Arts Tower, a 20-unit commercial condominium at 545 West 25th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building took just over two years to sell out, beginning at prices of about $700 a square foot and peaking at prices of more than $2,000 a square foot in 2007, said Margarette Lee, a principal with Youngwoo. Then prices fell, as they did throughout Chelsea, though they have now returned to about $1,200 a square foot, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lee said that planning for the Chelsea Arts Tower began as far back as the mid-1990s, when the developer acquired the lot in Chelsea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All these galleries were being ousted by retailers in SoHo, and they came to Chelsea, and they started buying their real estate, because everywhere they go, the neighborhood gets really nice, and the rent goes up so high, they have to leave,'' she said. ''We saw that and went in early and said, 'I think a lot of these art-related businesses would want to buy instead of rent.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, the Chelsea Arts Tower was aimed only at galleries, but developers soon found out that relatively few galleries had the capital to purchase a condo. ''You had to be an established gallery to buy,'' Ms. Lee said. ''There are many more struggling galleries than successful galleries.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lee said that about half of the Chelsea Arts Tower was art galleries, most of which came not from SoHo but from the 57th Street area, a part of Manhattan popular with the interior design industry. The rest of the tower's units are devoted to fashion- and arts-related businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relatively few of the units have resold. ''Maybe four at the most,'' Ms. Lee said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of what has kept real estate developers and retailers at bay so far in Chelsea is special zoning created by the city in the 1990s, which helped preserve Chelsea's low scale and kept commercial mixed in with residential, mostly in midblock areas of 24th through 27th Streets. As well, the area's relative lack of mass transportation has discouraged widespread residential development, real estate experts said. While SoHo has many subway lines running through it, creating ample foot traffic, gallery-hoppers -- and potential shoppers -- have to go out of their way to get to Chelsea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the residential development along the High Line is changing that equation. For instance, among the dozens of projects planned is one by AvalonBay that is creating more than 700 rental apartments near 28th Street and 11th Avenue. The growing need for retail amenities as well as essential services is creating competition with art galleries for retail space, said Jonathan Denham, a principal with Denham Wolf Real Estate Services, a commercial real estate brokerage that works exclusively with nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Denham said there were still commercial spaces that nonprofit arts businesses could afford to lease, especially in the eastern part of Chelsea, away from the High Line. But Ms. Byrne Denham said she thought the number of art galleries in Chelsea might have peaked at about 350.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the opening of a six-story branch of the Whitney Museum of American Art at Washington and Gansevoort Streets at the foot of the High Line could spur renewed interest in Chelsea by arts tenants, Ms. Byrne Denham said. She described it as a double-edged sword, however, saying it could drive up real estate values even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even buying space may not protect all art galleries and businesses, and there have already been some arts-related casualties in the neighborhood. After being foreclosed upon, the Chelsea Art Museum sold its building at 556 West 22nd Street earlier this year to the Albanese Organization, a New York City developer. The museum will continue to operate there until the end of 2011, but then will find a new home. Meantime, the building is on the market for leasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We bought the building to be sure the museum could stay,'' said Dorothea Keeser, the president of the Chelsea Art Museum, who attributed the building's loss to failed and contentious real estate negotiations with a developer. As for relocating somewhere in Chelsea, with its rising prices, Ms. Keeser said that would be ''very questionable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But how would people find us if we move to another part of New York?'' she asked. ''It already took years for the visitors to be accustomed to us in Chelsea.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Joyce Theater at 175 Eighth Avenue and 19th Street, which has a 35-year lease that expires in 2016, is contemplating moving out of Chelsea altogether. Part of that is because of pricing worries, but the theater company also needs more operational space, said Mr. Denham, who is counseling the Joyce in its search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've looked at a couple things in Chelsea, but we're being realistic, and if we do have to go, we'll probably want to play the role of being the incubator or pioneer in another up-and-coming neighborhood, similar to what we've done here,'' said Linda Shelton, the executive director of the Joyce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other arts organizations may be maneuvering to stick it out in Chelsea, like the Pace Gallery, which bought the space at 510 West 25th Street in September 2010, Ms. Byrne Denham said. Still, selling is not always as simple as accepting a cash buyout, brokers said. Unless the art business is closing altogether or has other branches, it has to buy or lease a new location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It can be tempting to entertain those offers,'' Mr. Denham said. ''You might be able to sell for top dollar, but in order for the organization to stay in business, they also have to go out immediately and buy property, also frequently at top dollar.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: July 14, 2011, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about arts-related spaces misidentified the developer of the Chelsea Arts Tower condominium on West 25th Street. It was built by Bass Associates L.L.C. -- not by Youngwoo &amp; Associates. (Bass is a partnership of Youngwoo &amp; Associates and Chelsea Development Group.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UNTIL recently, real estate brokers in New York City rarely shared information about one another's listings. As a result, buyers had no way of knowing whether their agent was showing them every property available, and sellers wondered whether their homes were getting the exposure necessary to secure the best deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies like StreetEasy, Zillow and The New York Times have helped open up the market by gathering listing information from various real estate databases and making it easy for consumers to search for homes online. But many brokerages still display only the firm's exclusive listings on their Web sites -- either because they are focusing on selling their own properties or resigned to the fact that customers have migrated elsewhere to research what is on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other brokerage firms are getting into the digital game themselves, creating a ''virtual office Web site'' or VOW. These are sites operated by brokers that enable clients to search for most of the available properties in a particular market, not just the firm's exclusive listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While brokers have mixed feelings about whether these sites are worth the investment, the emergence of the VOW is yet another sign that once tightly guarded listing information has finally been set free in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Five years ago, protecting listings was the single most important thing, and people were very selective about where their listings ended up,'' said Eric Gordon, the managing director of RealPlus, which develops VOWs for clients as well as operating the listings database used by members of the Real Estate Board of New York. ''Now they want us to send their listings to every site we could possibly send them to. There are exceptions, but in general, the feeling is, 'just get our listings out there as quickly and efficiently as possible.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The virtual office Web site concept was spurred by a 2008 settlement between the Justice Department and the National Association of Realtors, which forced brokerages to share listing data with their rivals, including Internet-based firms that offer rebates or other discounts to buyers willing to do most of the legwork to find a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most parts of the country, brokers share information about properties through a multiple listing service, or M.L.S., a database operated by a real estate association on behalf of its members. Although Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx each have a multiple listing service, many agents in New York City are not members and instead participate in a similar service managed by the Real Estate Board of New York, called R.L.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents who belong to these services are typically required to share property information with other brokers within a day or two of signing an exclusive listing, and these databases now share listings with each other as well as sites like StreetEasy, The New York Times, and hundreds of national and international portals like <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> and <span class="companylink">Google</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sites like StreetEasy have free rein to publish listing information online for customers to search, aggregating data from various sources to create fairly comprehensive databases of properties available in New York City, including homes for sale by owner. But if brokerages want to post other firms' listings on their Web sites, they must go through the process of becoming a virtual office Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For prospective buyers the main difference between a VOW and other real estate search sites is that a VOW has to adhere to rules dictated by the Justice Department settlement, including a requirement that customers register with a name, an e-mail address and a password before they can search for listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Required registration can be a turn-off, some agents say, especially for casual shoppers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problem I have with VOWs is that they force you to register before you can get information about properties,'' said Douglas Heddings, the president of the Heddings Property Group. ''To me it seems like a step backward, in that it's holding the information hostage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the Heddings Property Group was one of the first firms in New York City to create a virtual office Web site just last year, Mr. Heddings said he was planning to abandon it in favor of a partnership with Buyfolio, a company that allows agents and their customers to search for listings as well as share feedback about properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Buyfolio, a relatively new company focusing on the New York market, these collaboration tools are a key selling point. But now that real estate brokerages, technology start-ups like StreetEasy and media companies like The New York Times all have access to the same basic data about listings, the competition to attract buyers searching for homes online is heating up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You've still got to bring people to your Web site,'' said Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, or Rebny. ''Just creating a VOW doesn't mean people are going to come and use it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, 98 of the 484 residential brokerage firms that are members of Rebny have created a virtual office Web site, Mr. Spinola said. This involves paying a fee to have the board audit the site to ensure it complies with the standards, like how client registration is handled and how listings data is managed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the board recently overhauled its own Web site, now called NY1Residential.com, it partnered with the local news channel NY1 and decided not to create a VOW, partly to avoid the registration requirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We made a decision that we weren't going to ask people to sign in,'' Mr. Spinola said. ''It was just the sense of the members that they wanted to keep it an open Web site that anyone could search.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among New York City real estate firms, there are mixed feelings about whether a VOW delivers enough benefits to justify either the cost of creating one or the trade-offs involved in complying with rules about how these sites interact with clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After signing up for a VOW, customers have to wait for an e-mail to confirm that they have registered, and must also agree to terms and conditions that can run as long as a dozen pages. Those terms typically include an acknowledgment that the customer is entering into a lawful consumer-broker relationship with the agency, legally required language that does not obligate the buyer to work with the agency. This can seem like overkill just to search for, say, two-bedroom apartments in Chelsea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some brokerages are wagering that the hurdles are worth jumping, that there is money to be made from providing clients with a comprehensive set of properties rather than just the firm's own listings, the traditional practice. Most VOWs also include tracking features that allow the agency to monitor customers' searches, potentially producing useful data about what clients are looking for online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was complicated to become a VOW, and it was costly,'' said Dottie Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. But, she said, the company's Web site is more client-friendly now, allowing searches for properties in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, the Hamptons and Westchester County, including listings from other firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the registration requirement, Ms. Herman said she would have preferred that it be optional, but she doesn't view it as a major deterrent. ''I think most people don't have a problem with it, because everybody asks for your e-mail address today,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visitors to the Prudential Douglas Elliman site, once they have signed up, can search, sort and save listings. Results are displayed with the firm's exclusive listings first, then those of other firms. But unlike, say StreetEasy, there is no direct link to the other firm's site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bellmarc Realty is another big firm that is embracing the virtual office approach. Neil Binder, the president of Bellmarc, said that after experimenting with allowing individual agents to offer a VOW, generally using third-party software, the firm decided to develop a company-wide site instead, which will debut once it gets Rebny's approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Binder said that the Bellmarc agents who tried VOWs created by third-party vendors did not find they generated much business, but he believes the new VOW will be more effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to be more of an evaluation tool than an information tool,'' Mr. Binder said. ''I'm trying to create a process of comparison to show how properties stand up next to each other.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other large firms in the city are taking a wait-and-see approach. Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property, said that about a quarter of the company's agents had incorporated a VOW into their individual pages, but that Halstead had not developed one for its corporate site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corcoran has not jumped on the VOW bandwagon at all, said Pamela Liebman, the company's president, partly because listing information is already widely available and partly because of doubts about VOWs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've watched the traffic of some of the firms that have put VOWs on their site, and from what we can see it hasn't increased,'' Ms. Liebman said, adding that Corcoran also had not experienced an uptick in the number of deals it is doing with buyers' brokers who have virtual office Web sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond basic listing data, real estate Web sites compete for buyers, and page views, by offering additional information: price histories, recorded sales, building details and school district data -- as well as discussion forums, mapping tools and features that make it easier to search for homes and then sort the results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow and The New York Times offer real estate apps for mobile devices, and these mobile users now account for a third of Zillow's traffic on weekends, said Amy Bohutinsky, the company's chief marketing officer, a trend that could put VOWs at a disadvantage as more people embrace smartphones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, brokers say they are not trying to compete with these sites, which are viewed more as information distributors than rivals, especially at a time when so much data has been digitally set free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now listings are all over the place -- all that information is published by a million different sites,'' Ms. Herman said. ''This is the world we're in today, and if you don't embrace change I don't think you can be in business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: BEEN THERE, DONE THAT: Douglas Heddings, the president of Heddings Property Group, says his company, early to adopt a virtual office Web site, is switching to another model, Buyfolio. Dottie Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, says a VOW is an added convenience to her clients. Neil Binder, the president of Bellmarc Realty, says its VOW will allow property comparisons.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it never shared the notoriety of Miami, Los Angeles and Phoenix during America's foreclosure crisis, the Chicago area now has the nation's largest inventory of foreclosed homes because it is harder to unload troubled properties here than in most other metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to data compiled by RealtyTrac, a California company that tracks housing sales, Chicago ranks first among the country's 20 largest metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate experts attribute the high concentration of foreclosures to numerous factors including the strong protections built into Illinois law to protect borrowers, the impact of the ''robo-signing'' investigation by the Illinois attorney general, and the reluctance of banks to dump properties at prices far below the value of mortgage loans on their books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, banks and real estate firms here take longer to dispose of the properties they seize when loans go bad. The Chicago metropolitan area had 118,776 homes in May 2011 that were either owned by banks or were in the process of being taken over by lenders because the owners could no longer afford their monthly mortgage payments, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chicago area inventory exceeds numbers in the Los Angeles and Miami areas, where the foreclosure crisis seemed particularly severe, and Chicago's inventory of foreclosed homes is falling more slowly than elsewhere, real estate and legal experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stubbornly high level of the foreclosure inventory here also seems to have a negative impact on housing prices in neighborhoods without a large number of foreclosures. A report from the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index, a leading measure of the health of the residential housing market, said Chicago single-family home prices in April declined 0.4 percent from March while the service's 20-city index rose 0.7 percent, the first increase in eight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think you can say that a person in Lincoln Park will hold off buying a home because things are not going well in Pullman,'' said Winifred Curran, an associate professor of geography at De Paul University who has studied the foreclosure problems in Chicago. ''But there is definitely a ripple effect.'' That occurs, she said, when ''there is a sense that the city does not have a healthy market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate and foreclosure experts, like Rick Rogers of the Rogers Law Group in Bannockburn, expressed skepticism about the numbers. Mr. Rogers said it often took far longer to foreclose on properties in states like Florida, Nevada and Michigan. Ms. Curran of DePaul also said the RealtyTrac numbers trended high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But RealtyTrac says it compiles data from more than 2,200 counties throughout the United States to create a report on the top 20 metropolitan areas that conform to United States Census tracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The May 2011 RealtyTrac data, in which the foreclosure inventory here drifted lower from prior months as sales picked up slightly, said the Los Angeles area ranked second, with 86,745 homes either owned by banks or in the process of foreclosure. New York City ranks third with 84,600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data, which go back to January 2008 -- when the bursting of the years-long housing bubble was first gaining national attention -- show that the Chicago region has consistently ranked near the top in the listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data suggest that banks and real estate agents in the area do not sell foreclosed properties as rapidly as they do in places like Miami, where home prices soared but then fell quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago sells fewer foreclosed homes each month than any other major metropolitan area except New York, where state laws similar to Illinois's offer protections that make it hard for banks to drive borrowers from their homes. During the first five months of the year, for instance, an average 4,004 foreclosed homes in Phoenix were sold each month. The monthly averages were only 1,697 foreclosed-home sales in Chicago, while 762 foreclosed properties sold in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Curran at DePaul said that the housing boom in places like Miami had been so hot that banks became more desperate when prices plummeted and were more willing to sell at lower prices than in the Midwest, where housing prices rose but at a much slower pace than in other places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's the banks; they are not willing to lower prices,'' said John Bouman, president of the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, an advocacy organization for low-income people. ''So these properties just sit there empty because they don't want to sell it at a lower price and lose the money they have in it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bouman, who lives in Maywood, said the foreclosure problems had made it difficult for his family. The house across the street from him has been vacant for more than a year, he said, and he knows of two prospective buyers who inquired about the property but could not get satisfactory answers from the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bouman said he and his wife had thought about selling their house and moving to a condominium in Chicago, but the glut of foreclosures had depressed prices so much that he could not get enough money for his house to afford one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes I think that it's hard to find anyone at the banks who can make a decision,'' Mr. Bouman said, ''so these properties just sit there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geoff Smith, a senior vice president at the Woodstock Institute, a nonprofit research organization that specializes in housing issues, said one factor contributing to Chicago's slow sales rate was that Illinois is a judicial state that requires banks to go through a court system to foreclose on a property rather than simply filing a notice to the borrower. Numerous consumer safeguards typically slow down the process and cause a backlog of cases in the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smith said the ''robo-signing'' scandal currently under investigation by Lisa Madigan, the Illinois attorney general, also contributed to the slower pace. ''Robo-signing'' refers to the robotic generation of erroneous or fraudulent loan documents by companies that service mortgage loans. Some foreclosures were based on fake documents, giving homeowners an opportunity to challenge the right of financial institutions to seize the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Problems were generated by the servicers not processing these correctly,'' Mr. Smith said. ''This led to government intervention. The state had to make sure its citizens were protected.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a study done by Nicholas Bianchi of National People's Action, a national community rights organization, the nation's five largest banks -- <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, Wells Fargo Bank, <span class="companylink">J. P. Morgan Chase Bank</span>, Citibank and US Bank -- are involved in three of every five foreclosures in Cook County. Mr. Bianchi's study says most foreclosures also occurred in black and Latino neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several banks declined to comment about the reasons for the slow pace of sales here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daren Blomquist, the marketing and communications director at RealtyTrac, said he thought there was a big difference between foreclosures in the Midwest and the West, where the real estate boom drove prices sharply higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures of western properties tended to be in sought-after suburbs, he said, but in Chicago they came in older, economically weaker neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the West, there were a lot of foreclosures on newer properties in suburbs that might be more desirable to someone trying to get back into the market,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, Mr. Blomquist said foreclosures in the Midwest tended to be in neighborhoods where the property might have been more vulnerable to neglect or vandalism.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fences make good neighbors, the saying goes, but those who live near the building at 1886 Mission Street in San Francisco would prefer a bulldozer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sooner it gets knocked down, the better,'' said Paul O'Driscoll, who has an office across the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacant property, the former Louis Roesch Company printing factory at the corner of 15th and Mission, occupies half a city block in one of the world's most expensive real estate markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the vast building has often been left unsecured -- doors open day and night -- and in recent years has become a magnet for intruders, vandalism and graffiti.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also appears that its owners are not abiding by a two-year-old city ordinance that regulates vacant buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the bane of my existence,'' said Ian Melven, whose third-floor condominium overlooks the building. ''It's a little worrying. Who knows what's going on in there?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avant Housing, a local real estate developer, acquired the property last year. Even in its current state, it is valued at more than $7.4 million by the city's Office of the Assessor-Recorder. Avant has a $60 million plan to build 202 apartments on the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, for the better part of a decade there have been plans to build housing there, but they have been delayed for various circumstances, including lawsuits, financing problems and a previous owner's death. The city has become wary in recent years of allowing buildings to be demolished unless new construction starts immediately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Planning Department said approval for the latest plans could be just weeks away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, neighbors say they are tired of having to be vigilant and report problems. ''It's a blight on a real up-and-coming block,'' Mr. Melven said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to the neighbors' complaints, city resources are being spent on private property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, workers for the Department of Public Works painted over graffiti on the building, a chore that one crew member said was performed regularly. (In fact, graffiti returned within hours.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avant Housing is a joint venture of the San Francisco developers AGI Capital and TMG Partners, with financing from <span class="companylink">CalPERS</span>, the <span class="companylink">California Public Employees Retirement System</span>, which has come under fire in recent years for questionable investments. AGI Capital is listed as the contact on city permit applications, but executives did not respond to repeated requests to discuss the property. A receptionist who answered the phone for Avant Housing laughed when I asked for an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only after I contacted <span class="companylink">CalPERS</span>, which reportedly has $100 million of state workers' retirement money invested with Avant Housing, did anyone respond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questions were referred to Julie Chase, a public relations expert hired by Avant Housing, who at first said there had been no problems. When told that the issues had been witnessed firsthand over the course of weeks, including the building's being left open at night, Ms. Chase said, ''You were there at night?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, according to the Department of Building Inspection, the building's owners paid $765 to register the property as a vacant building, complying with a city ordinance passed in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ordinance, meant to help the city track and exert more control over an estimated 400 vacant properties, requires owners to secure and maintain their buildings, abate graffiti and conspicuously post their contact information. Repeated visits to 1886 Mission Street in recent weeks found no such posting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the ordinance, violators can be fined up to $6,885; in just two years, $157,000 in fines have already been levied citywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the city has not fined Avant Housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Strawn, spokesman for the Department of Building Inspection, said in an e-mail, ''Our enforcement philosophy is to work with property owners and ensure they meet legal code requirements, rather than to collect fines and penalties.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the company will receive a bill for the paint job, said Gloria Chan, spokeswoman for the Department of Public Works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had to step in there and do it,'' Ms. Chan said, explaining that the city intervenes when graffiti is chronic or profane (graffiti cleanup efforts citywide cost taxpayers $20 million annually). Private property owners are charged a minimum of $400 for graffiti abatement, plus a $250 fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Chase said that Avant Housing had private contracts for graffiti abatement and security, but that police officers entered the building last week to remove people who were illegally inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All involved agree that the many problems at 1886 Mission Street could be easily solved -- with a wrecking ball.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WUHAN, China -- In the seven years it will take New York City to build a two-mile leg of its long-awaited Second Avenue subway line, this city of nine million people in central China plans to complete an entirely new subway system, with nearly 140 miles of track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Wuhan Metro is only one piece of a $120 billion municipal master plan that includes two new airport terminals, a new financial district, a cultural district and a riverfront promenade with an office tower half again as high as the Empire State Building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction frenzy cloaks Wuhan, China's ninth-largest city, in a continual dust cloud, despite fleets of water trucks constantly spraying the streets. No wonder the local Communist party secretary, recently promoted from mayor, is known as ''Mr. Digging Around the City.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plans for Wuhan, a provincial capital about 425 miles west of Shanghai, might seem extravagant. But they are not unusual. Dozens of other Chinese cities are racing to complete infrastructure projects just as expensive and ambitious, or more so, as they play their roles in this nation's celebrated economic miracle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last few years, cities' efforts have helped government infrastructure and real estate spending surpass foreign trade as the biggest contributor to China's growth. Subways and skyscrapers, in other words, are replacing exports of furniture and iPhones as the symbols of this nation's prowess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are growing signs that China's long-running economic boom could be undermined by these building binges, which are financed through heavy borrowing by local governments and clever accounting that masks the true size of the debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The danger, experts say, is that China's municipal governments could already be sitting on huge mountains of hidden debt -- a lurking liability that threatens to stunt the nation's economic growth for years or even decades to come. Just last week China's national auditor, who reports to the cabinet, warned of the perils of local government borrowing. And on Tuesday the Beijing office of Moody's Investors Service issued a report saying the national auditor might have understated Chinese banks' actual risks from loans to local governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Chinese growth has been one of the few steady engines in the global economy in recent years, any significant slowdown in this country would have international repercussions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As municipal projects play out across China, spending on so-called fixed-asset investment -- a crucial measure of building that is heavily weighted toward government and real estate projects -- is now equal to nearly 70 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. It is a ratio that no other large nation has approached in modern times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Japan, at the peak of its building boom in the 1980s, reached only about 35 percent, and the figure has hovered around 20 percent for decades in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's high number helps explain its meteoric material rise. But it could also signal a dangerous dependence on government infrastructure spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If China's good at anything, it's infrastructure,'' said Pieter P. Bottelier, a China expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. ''But right now it seems the investment rate is too high. How much of that is ill-advised and future nonperforming loans, no one knows.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last decade, as economists have sought to explain China's rise, a popular image has emerged of Beijing technocrats continually and cannily fine-tuning the nation's communist-capitalist hybrid. But in fact, city governments often work at odds with Beijing's aims. And some of Beijing's own goals and policies can be contradictory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, China's state capitalism is much messier, and the economy more vulnerable, than it might look to the outside world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of Wuhan, a close look at its finances reveals that the city has borrowed tens of billions of dollars from state-run banks. But the loans seldom go directly to the local government. Instead, the borrowing is done by special investment corporations set up by the city -- business entities whose debt shows up nowhere on Wuhan's official financial balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the risk, the collateral for many loans is local land valued at lofty prices that could collapse if China's real estate bubble burst. Wuhan's land prices have tripled in the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest of the separate investment companies set up by the municipal government here is an entity known as Wuhan Urban Construction Investment and Development, created to help finance billions of dollars' worth of projects, including roadways, bridges and sewage treatment plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to city records, Wuhan U.C.I.D. has 16,000 employees, 25 subsidiaries and $15 billion in assets -- including the possibly inflated value of the land itself. But it owes nearly as much, about $14 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''U.C.I.D. is heavily in debt,'' a company spokesman, Sun Zhengrong, conceded in an interview. ''This may lead to potential problems. So we are trying to make some adjustments.'' He declined to elaborate, saying the state company's finances were ''our core secret.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dozens of other cities are following a similarly risky script: creating off balance-sheet corporations that are going deeply into debt for showpiece projects, new subway systems, high-speed rail lines and extravagant government office complexes. And they are doing it despite efforts by the central government in Beijing to rein in the excess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To limit the cities' debt, Beijing has long prohibited municipalities from issuing bonds to finance government projects -- as American cities do as a matter of course. Lately, too, China's central government has put tighter limits on state-owned banks' lending to municipalities. But by using off-the-books investment companies, cities have largely eluded Beijing's rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zhang Dong, a municipal government adviser who also teaches finance at the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law in Wuhan, estimates that less than 5 percent of the city's infrastructure spending comes from Wuhan's general budget. ''Most of it comes from off-the-books financing,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This system is not a secret from Beijing, which now says there are more than 10,000 of these local government financing entities in China. In fact, because Beijing now takes a large share of government tax revenue, local governments have had to find their own way to grow, and land development is primarily how they have done it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is a risky game. A recent report by the investment bank <span class="companylink">UBS</span> predicted that local government investment corporations could generate up to $460 billion in loan defaults over the next few years. As a percentage of China's G.D.P., that would be far bigger than the $700 billion troubled-asset bailout program in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As frightening as that may sound, many analysts see no reason for panic -- no imminent threat of an economy-collapsing banking crisis in China. That is largely because of Beijing's $3 trillion war chest of foreign exchange reserves (much of it invested in United States Treasury bonds), and the fact that China's state-run banks are also sitting on huge piles of household savings from the nation's 1.3 billion citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because all that cash is protected by government restrictions on money flowing in and out of the country, a global run on China's banks would be unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real problem, analysts say, is that municipal government debt in China has begun casting a large shadow over the nation's growth picture. If instead of investing in growth, China had to start spending money to gird the banks against municipal defaults, some experts see a possibility of China eventually lapsing into a long period of Japan-like stagnation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Recession Peril</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economics professor and co-author of ''This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly,'' has studied China's boom. He predicts that within a decade China's lofty property bubble and its mounting debts could cause a regional recession in Asia and stifle growth in the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With China, you have the ultimate 'this time is different' syndrome,'' Professor Rogoff said. ''Economists say they have huge reserves, they have savings, they're hard-working people. It's naive. You can't beat the odds forever.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Beijing's estimate, total local government debt amounted to $2.2 trillion last year -- a staggering figure, equal to one-third of the nation's gross domestic product. A wave of municipal defaults could become a huge liability for the central government, which is sitting on about $2 trillion in debt of its own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Beijing's estimate of what the cities owe might be too low, in the view of Victor Shih, a professor of political economy at Northwestern University who has studied China's municipal debt. He says that by now, after even more borrowing in early 2011 and some figures hidden from government audits, total municipal debt in China could be closer to $3 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most of the government entities that borrow can't even make the interest payments on the loans,'' Professor Shih said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the clock, seven days a week, the construction crews burrow to build Wuhan's $45 billion subway system. One segment snakes beneath the mighty Yangtze River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For most areas we dig down 18 to 26 meters,'' said Lin Wenshu, one of the planning directors of the Wuhan Metro. ''But for part of this line we've had to go down 50 meters because there's high pressure and a lot of mud from the river,'' he said. ''But the citizens want a subway system, and so we're going to build it as fast as possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, city officials say there are more than 5,700 construction projects under way in Wuhan. In some neighborhoods, workers demolish old homes with little more than sledgehammers and their bare hands to make way for shopping malls, high-rise apartment complexes and new expressways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having seen Beijing, Shanghai and other coastal metropolises thrive on big infrastructure projects, cities thousands of miles inland, like Wuhan, are trying to do likewise. Wuhan wants to become a manufacturing and transportation hub for the heartland -- China's version of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is a dream built on debt. This year, relying largely on bank loans, Wuhan plans to spend about $22 billion on infrastructure projects, an amount five times as large as the city's tax revenue last year. And aspirations notwithstanding, Wuhan is still relatively poor. Residents here earn about $3,000 a year, only about two-thirds as much as those in Shanghai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Wuhan has made the most of the soaring value of its land. In the northwest part of the city, for example, bulldozers have cleared a huge tract more than twice the size of Central Park. A dozen years ago it was a military air base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giant billboards advertise a new purpose: future home of the Wangjiadun Central Business District, featuring office towers and luxury apartments for 200,000 people. That assumes, of course, that financing for the project -- a web of loans and deals based largely on the underlying value of the land -- holds up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planning began in 1999, when the city decided to relocate the air base. After the city ran short of cash for the project, in 2002, it turned to a deep-pocketed Beijing developer, the Oceanwide Corporation. Oceanwide agreed to chip in $275 million and pay some of the infrastructure costs in exchange for a prime piece of the land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the city has sold large plots of the former air base to other developers, while earmarking yet other parcels for future sale to help pay for the new business district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no question that China needs new infrastructure and transportation networks if it is to meet its goal of transforming most of its huge population into city dwellers. Less certain is whether the country can afford to keep building at this pace, and whether many of these projects will ever pay off in terms of the economic development they are meant to support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing helped ratchet up the municipal building boom in early 2009, when in response to the global recession, it pressed local governments to think big and announced a huge economic stimulus package. That unleashed a wave of government-backed bank lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we're seeing was not very common before 2008,'' said Fu Zhihua, a research fellow at the Research Institute for Fiscal Science. ''Now, all cities are rushing headlong into this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now, try as it might, Beijing seems unable to stop the stampede.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the problem may be incentives in China's Politburo-driven economic system. Simply put, municipal officials in China keep their jobs and earn promotions on the basis of short-term economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fact is, local governments in China compete to grow G.D.P. in order to get promoted as government officials,'' said Zeng Kanghua, who teaches finance at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ruan Chengfa, Wuhan's 54-year-old local Communist party secretary, who was promoted earlier this year from mayor, has certainly benefited politically from his ''Mr. Digging'' reputation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He declined to be interviewed for this article. But in a speech in February, he said, ''If we want Wuhan to have leapfrog development and enhance people's happiness, then we must build subways and bridges.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressure From Beijing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wuhan is starting to show symptoms of financial stress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite selling about $25 billion worth of land over the last five years, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a research firm based in New York, Wuhan is struggling to pay for its projects. City officials have announced a big increase in bridge tolls. Under pressure from Beijing to reduce Wuhan's debt, they have promised to pay back $2.3 billion to state-backed creditors this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the city would do this by borrowing more money or selling land or assets is unclear. But rolling over old debts with new borrowing is not uncommon among Chinese cities. In 2009, for instance, Wuhan's big investment company, Wuhan U.C.I.D., borrowed $230 million from investors and then used nearly a third of the money to repay some of its bank loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mainly, Wuhan's leaders are counting on property prices to continue defying gravity, even if some analysts predict a coming crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report this year, the investment bank <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> identified Wuhan as one of China's ''top 10 cities to avoid,'' saying its housing stock was so huge that it would take eight years to sell the residences already completed -- never mind the hundreds of thousands now under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But criticism has not deterred Mr. Ruan, the local party secretary, who has vowed to keep his foot on the shovel. ''If we don't speed up construction,'' he said in the speech in February, ''many of Wuhan's problems won't be solved.''</p>

Under another technique, the city sets up a separate entity to borrow money for the projects -- debt that shows up nowhere on the city's official balance sheet.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A FOUR-BEDROOM RESTORED FARMHOUSE WITH A SWIMMING POOL IN PROVENCE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1.6 MILLION EUROS ($2.67 MILLION)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This four-bedroom, three-bath house was built with local stone in the 18th century and completely updated a decade ago. The house has a tiled roof and typical Provencal terra cotta flooring. A well, covered with safety glass, is a decorative feature in the foyer. It was once in the farmyard, but was encompassed within the house during an expansion more than 200 years ago. The arched stone doorway leading from the foyer into the living room is original, as are the exposed wooden beams in the ceilings of the living room and kitchen. A second, informal living room has a study at one end. There is a guest bedroom with an adjoining bathroom on the first floor. A curved stone banister flanks the staircase that leads upstairs to three additional bedrooms. The master bedroom, which overlooks the swimming pool, has an adjoining bathroom and a dressing room. The other two upstairs bedrooms share a hall bath. The house is climate controlled year round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The farmhouse is set on 4.7 acres, about half of which are lavender fields. The property also has olive trees and a chicken coop. Among the other outbuildings, which are included in the house price, are a pool house with a dressing room and a shower, a two-car garage and a barn for storing tools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house is five minutes' drive from the shops and restaurants in the village of Cavaillon, at the southern end of the mountainous Luberon area in Provence. The popular antiquing town of L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue is 15 minutes from the house. The airport near Marseilles is a 40-minute drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKET OVERVIEW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market in Provence is healthy this year, according to Antoine Reguis, owner of Your Provence, a real estate company based in Goult. Well-priced homes sell in four to six months, ''which is a normal delay for this rural market,'' Mr. Reguis said. Andrea Bichi, a property consultant for Your Provence and the listing agent for this property, said that in the current market homes often sell for 10 to 15 percent below the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The prices are still high, in spite of a slight decrease in 2010,'' said Marie-Madeleine Nelson, managing director of the real estate company Un Mas en Provence. She added that sales prices spiked 40 percent just before the economic downturn in 2008, and that the 2010 decrease was part of a market correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Village houses in Provence with no outdoor space cost about 300,000 euros ($425,000 at .71 euros to the dollar), Mr. Reguis said, while village houses with gardens or terraces can command as much as 800,000 euros. Farmhouses with a bit of land start at 700,000 to 800,000 euros, but Mr. Reguis said most farmhouses in good condition cost 1 million to 2 million euros. It would be rare, he added, for a country house in Provence to sell for more than 7 million euros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices per square meter vary from 2,500 to 10,000 euros, with most houses costing around 5,000 euros per square meter, according to Mr. Reguis. The home profiled here is listed at about 5,700 euros per square meter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO BUYS IN PROVENCE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 40 percent of Ms. Nelson's clients are foreigners. She sees a lot of buyers from Northern Europe, especially Belgium and Britain. She also has significant numbers of American clients, and she said buyers frequently come from Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. The Luberon area is also an attractive vacation home destination to residents from the colder areas in Northern France, Ms. Nelson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYING BASICS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes are the largest transaction cost, from 6 to 7 percent of the sales price, according to Mr. Reguis. This figure also includes the notary fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no restrictions on foreign buyers, ''but there is a difference when selling,'' Mr. Reguis said. Capital gains taxes vary depending on what country the seller lives in, whether the home is a primary home or a secondary home, and how long the seller has owned the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In France, asking prices typically include the real estate agent's commission, which is usually 5 percent of the sales price, according to Mr. Bichi. One agent handles the entire sale, unlike other countries where it is common for each party to hire their own agent.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Yorkers who stay in town during summer and holiday weekends know the empty-streets, Potemkin-village look that parts of the city take on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some Manhattan neighborhoods are assuming that vacant feeling the year round, because the people who own or rent apartments there actually live somewhere else most of the time. This explains why, in a city of bright lights, so many windows dotting the imposing facades of Fifth, Madison and Park Avenue apartment buildings are pitch dark every evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy out-of-towners have always had pieds-a-terre and unused investment properties in the city. What is new is how many.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a large swath of the East Side bounded by Fifth and Park Avenues and East 49th and 70th Streets, about 30 percent of the more than 5,000 apartments are routinely vacant more than 10 months a year because their owners or renters have permanent homes elsewhere, according to the Census Bureau's latest American Community Survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one part of that stretch, between East 53rd and 59th Streets, more than half of the 500 apartments are occupied for two months or less. That is a higher proportion than in resort and second-home communities like Aspen, Colo.; Palm Beach, Fla.; Virginia Beach; and Litchfield, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the ranks of part-timers are growing. Since 2000, the number of Manhattan apartments occupied by absentee owners and renters swelled by more than 70 percent, to nearly 34,000, from 19,000. They proliferated in virtually every census tract south of 110th Street, with the most pronounced surges in the East Village, SoHo, Greenwich Village, Gramercy Park, Midtown East and the Upper East Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My block is like a ghost town,'' said Gay Talese, the author and keen urban observer, who has lived on East 61st off Park Avenue for a half-century. ''It's dark on this street at night, and I'm not talking about summer people in the Hamptons and people who have apartments here but spend a lot of time out of town for tax reasons.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He described the part-timers as ''skim-milk New Yorkers -- only 2 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reasons abound. The construction of luxury housing, especially condominiums, has exploded in the last decade, and the market for high-end apartments has rebounded. Manhattan continues to attract foreign investors seeking a haven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More out-of-towners contemplating retirement in the city are trying Manhattan on for size, with an apartment they visit now and then. Globalization has more executives sleeping less often in what is ostensibly their hometown. And many New Yorkers have long spent most of their time elsewhere and claimed permanent domicile there to avoid the city's higher resident income tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other cities are concerned that too many out-of-towners buying up desirable homes will deaden neighborhoods and deplete any street life: Charleston, S.C., has subjected second homes to higher property taxes than primary residences. New York City does not, taxing second and permanent homes at the same rate, but a state tribunal this year suggested that city apartments owned by commuters could be included in the definition of a permanent abode, subjecting them to New York taxes even on income earned out of state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, fears of creating dead zones have been muted in Manhattan, where congestion routinely trumps desolation as an urban crisis and where, as a result, some residents actually prefer the sense of solitude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I love getting up in the morning and seeing Park Avenue empty,'' said Abby Leigh, an artist who lives with her husband, Mitch, the composer and real estate developer, on East 68th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among all of the 845,000 apartments and houses in Manhattan, 102,000 were identified as vacant in the 2005-9 American Community Survey. Of those, about 33,000 -- or about 1 in every 25 Manhattan homes -- had an owner or renter who lived there less than two months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proportion of part-time apartments in the borough peaked at nearly 4 in 10 in 2007, then dipped with the recession and has been rising again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trump Tower, at Fifth Avenue and East 56th Street, is in many ways typical of the trend. Rhona Graff, vice president of the <span class="companylink">Trump Organization</span>, estimates that only about half of those who own the building's 263 apartments live there full time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a good mix, but primarily Europeans, South Americans, Asians and, of course, Americans,'' she said. ''I would say the vast majority of these people are active in business, although there are some retirees.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether such a building seems half empty or half full depends on the dweller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people might feel they rather live in a building with more of a social environment,'' said Gary Malin, president of Citi Habitats, a real estate brokerage firm. ''Other people might say, 'Less people in my building means less wear and tear on the facilities.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the latter is Michael Gross, who wrote the book ''740 Park,'' about one of those apartment buildings, he explained, where every owner ''has five homes'' someplace else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's lovely,'' said Mr. Gross, who lives on a block of West 58th Street where about 1 in 6 people lives only part time. ''A fully staffed building, empty elevators and you never run out of hot water.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-ops are typically more likely to limit the number of pieds-a-terre than condominiums. ''They're not looking for people who are going to treat their apartments like a hotel and let friends come and go,'' said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malin said apartments have gained appeal as investments, ''with hotel rates being as crazy as they are and rental rates going through the roof.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of foreign buyers are coming in,'' he said. ''They think the finances make sense. An apartment is more convenient than a hotel, and they would rather have the investment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because some people have mixed feelings about sparsely occupied buildings, agents and owners are often reluctant to publicly reveal their full-time population. The proportion at the Excelsior at 303 East 57th Street is probably about the same as Trump Tower's, said Elayne Reimer, executive vice president of Halstead Property. So is 470 Park's at East 58th Street, another broker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doormen know. So do mail carriers. And building superintendents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, a leak in an apartment at Olympic Tower, on Fifth Avenue at 51st Street, caused $500,000 in damage to several apartments below it. A building newsletter noted that the mess ''could have been completely avoided if a set of working keys for that apartment were maintained'' at the concierge desk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notice did not say, however, whether the apartment was occupied full time. But another notice advised residents, ''If you do not plan to receive mail at the apartment, please specify where monthly common charge bill and correspondence should go.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Once Again, Floor Plans Are Making The Sale</span>
</div><div class="author">By VIVIAN S. TOY   </div><div>1542 words</div><div>3 July 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN the real estate market was booming, buyers routinely signed contracts for apartments in yet-to-be-built buildings, making their decisions based on little more than an artist's rendering and a miniature model of their new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That changed once the market crashed. Off-site showrooms disappeared, and buyers became deeply skeptical about floor plans and fancy brochures. Developers realized that buyers would no longer buy a home without first running a hand along a kitchen counter and standing by a window to take in the views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, though, several new developments around the city have once again sold apartments off floor plans. The practice is not widespread, and the examples tend to be in neighborhoods where there is very little new inventory. But at least one high-profile building that is under construction plans to sell off floor plans: the Extell Development Company's 90-story hotel/condominium tower across from Carnegie Hall -- One 57, at 157 West 57th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartments will not be ready for move-in for another two years, but sales will start soon after the offering plan is approved, which will probably be some time this summer, said Gary Barnett, the president of Extell. ''We have had such a strong reaction with people wanting to buy that we expect to get a fair amount of sales even before the sales office opens,'' he said. ''There's definitely a shortage of product right now, especially with views of Central Park and hotel services.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower floors of the building will house a Park Hyatt, and the building's Web site boasts that ''New York has never seen residences that see New York like this.'' Apartments range from one- to four-bedrooms, with prices from $5 million to upward of $30 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of the market, developers couldn't file offering plan amendments quickly enough to keep up with price increases for their apartments. Now, though, Mr. Barnett is more circumspect. ''We think our prices are reasonable given where the market is today,'' he said. And, he added, once the building is sold out, ''we're hopeful that prices will go up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that while there are plenty of ''scare stories'' about condos that haven't been completed or have been finished with substandard construction, ''for the right design and location, there's very little inventory, and if people want to lock into something, they'll buy off of floor plans.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the recent developments that have already sold apartments without model units to show, developers and brokers say they initially intended to test the market and were surprised at how quickly the apartments sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We never thought we would be selling off of floor plans,'' said Justin Ehrlich, a partner of VE Equities, which is building two small condos in TriBeCa. ''We underwrote these buildings with big budgets for marketing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he had expected it would take a year after opening the buildings at 471 Washington Street and One North Moore to fill them. Instead, sales started in April and each building now has only one unit left, even though neither will be ready for occupancy until late summer or early fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It helps that they're boutique small buildings and that's what people are looking for in TriBeCa,'' Mr. Ehrlich said, and there is very little else coming to market. VE Equities took over both projects after they had stalled under a previous developer. The building at Washington and Canal has 12 units, ranging from $2 million one-bedrooms to a $15 million penthouse; and the building at North Moore and West Broadway has five four-bedroom units, ranging from $5 million to $9.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For marketing materials, One North Moore had floor plans and an exterior rendering, but for 471 Washington, ''we splurged and hired a renderer'' to do drawings of the exterior and the interiors, said John Gomes, an executive vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman, who helped market the buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were some skeptics. Some ''people who showed up at the site couldn't believe that that was how we intended to offer the units and they just left,'' Mr. Gomes said. But others were willing to plunk down deposits after looking at floor plans, reviewing descriptions of the finishes, and looking at two-by-two squares of imported marble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At two other buildings in different neighborhoods, limited new development inventory also helped early sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Benaim, the president of Modern Spaces, an agency in Long Island City, Queens, said he decided late last year to test the market for the Yard, a sister building to the Powerhouse, a condo conversion of a former power plant. They sold eight of the building's 83 units before any of the apartments had walls or windows. ''It made me think of the days a couple years ago when people didn't really question buying before a building was finished,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because there are only a handful of condos in Long Island City with available apartments, Mr. Benaim said he was able to market the building to past clients and to potential buyers who visited his agency. Initial prices were slightly below the stated prices in the offering plan, at about $650 per square foot, he said. The building is now 35 percent sold and apartments are selling above $700 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grammi Lee and her husband, Alex Tse, signed a contract for a one-bedroom at the Yard in February, months before the developer opened up model units or even printed a brochure for the building, precisely because the price was attractive. Ms. Lee said she has friends who had bought in Long Island City for about $800 per square foot. ''When we saw that this was under $650 per square foot, we thought it was time to buy,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lee said because she is a graphic designer and her husband is a Web designer, they were able to envision their apartment even without the help of renderings or brochures. Being able to visit the Powerhouse also gave them confidence. ''Since the Powerhouse turned out pretty good, I thought the builder is reliable,'' she said. Ms. Lee and Mr. Tse both work in Manhattan and will move into their new home this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 123 Third Avenue, at 14th Street, the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group opened a sales office a few blocks from the building last September and sold 33 of the 47 units within four months. The building is now finished and has four penthouses remaining unsold, priced at $3.6 million to $4.5 million. Most of the apartments in the building are one-bedrooms that went for $650,000 to $950,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''During the downturn, people wanted to see and feel the product before buying anything,'' said Kelly Mack, the president of Corcoran Sunshine. But today, she said, in certain neighborhoods where inventory is low and prices have started to increase, some buyers clearly have enough confidence in the market to buy in an unfinished building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Mohrmann, an orthopedic surgeon who invests in real estate ''as a second career,'' said he bought two one-bedroom apartments at 123 Third Avenue intending to combine them into a three-bedroom for himself, but has since decided to rent them out. He has already found a tenant for one apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite these successful sales, most developers are still waiting to open their sales offices in model apartments because they believe they can sell at higher prices once the building opens and buyers face much less risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Laureate, an Upper West Side condo that had a waiting list with hundreds of names on it even before the exterior had been completed, Shlomi Reuveni, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens Select and the building's sales manager, said he did not want to sell strictly off floor plans, ''because we wanted to make sure people were very comfortable with what they were buying.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he met with people on the waiting list early this year, showing them floor plans, renderings and sample finishes. But buyers did not sign contracts until they were able to see where their apartments would be, even if it was raw space without walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We felt that to optimize people's appreciation of the space, we had to show it,'' Mr. Reuveni said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eleven units sold before the building was officially launched with model apartments in February. The building is now about 70 percent sold and the first closings are set for this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reuveni said he did not imagine a return to the kind of buying sight-unseen that was routine in 2006 and 2007. ''Purchasing habits have changed,'' he said. ''There is much more caution now.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A horse farm in Westchester for under $1 million? Unheard of five years ago, brokers say, but not so now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like buyers and sellers in the rest of the real estate market, the horsey set has been affected by the downturn. Horse properties have experienced sharp reductions across the price spectrum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some who once had to board their horses because they could not afford to own a farm may now be able to saddle up in their own backyards. For example, in North Salem, the heart of Westchester's horse country, a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath renovated 1875 farmhouse with a three-stall barn and four acres is listed for $895,000. Five years ago, it would have been priced at $1.3 million, said Carol Goldberg, the listing agent for Vincent &amp; Whittemore Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, at the high end of the market, in Millbrook in Dutchess County, another center for the equestrian crowd, Houlihan Lawrence earlier this year listed a 1910 five-bedroom estate with five full and four half baths on 276 acres for $26 million. With barn space for 50 or more horses, it was one of the best-equipped equestrian properties within striking distance of Midtown. In the end, though, it sold for only $18,375,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Orange, another county with a high number of horses, prices for equine properties have also fallen; sales are similarly down. Sanford Glazman, an associate broker with Better Homes &amp; Garden Rand Realty in Warwick, said his agency is selling only three or four such properties a year. Before the market tanked, it was double that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Glazman has a three-bedroom farmhouse with a six-stall barn and tack room on five acres for $475,000, as well as a 34-acre farm with 18 stalls and 10 paddocks for $1,795,000. ''The problem is, in the current market, even at the lower price range, most buyers today look at horses as very expensive toys, and we're feeling that,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, the farther away from Midtown, the less expensive the property. ''Some of my clients have looked in Westchester, but there aren't as many large tracts available there, and taxes are higher,'' Mr. Glazman said. ''As a result, places like Warwick have become viable alternatives, especially for people who work from home and only commute to Manhattan two or three days a week.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High property taxes and land costs notwithstanding, Bedford remains highly sought after by affluent horse owners, largely because of its proximity to Manhattan, said Alfie Rechichi, the manager of the Katonah office of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency has listings for smaller four-stall properties for under $1 million, as well as a 22-acre estate with 10 stalls for $8 million in Bedford Corners that was once home to the internationally famous dressage horse Flim Flam. Several years ago, the property was on the market for $13 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bedford's attractions for horse owners include 160 miles of bridle trails maintained by the Bedford Riding Lanes Association, a 91-year-old nonprofit group. These add ''value to a property, the way having a swimming pool or tennis courts would,'' said Robert Torre, the chief executive of the 500-member organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, many Westchester horse farms -- especially in the Bedford area -- are bought by individuals who work in the financial industry in Manhattan and have a family member who is ''very into horses,'' said Ghy Manning, the owner-broker of Vincent &amp; Whittemore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a way of life up here for many people,'' Ms. Manning said. ''They're buying their dream, their passion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vincent &amp; Whittemore has a 96-acre dream called Birdstone Farm in nearby Cross River, with 20 stalls and an indoor arena, $18,995,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not enough room for your warmblood mares? The agency also represents Grand Central Farm in North Salem, which has 286 acres, 20 stalls and two foaling stalls with heat and cameras, among other things. It is listed at $24,900,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But development pressures have been intense in Westchester, and according to the county Planning Department, agricultural activity declined steadily between 1983 and 1994, when nearly 4,000 acres, or 36 percent of farmland, were lost. In response, the County Board of Legislators created the Westchester County Agriculture and Farmland Protection Board in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nonprofit Westchester Land Trust in Bedford Hills works with landowners to preserve farmland. As Anthony P. Cutugno, a senior vice president of luxury properties for Houlihan Lawrence and a member of the land trust's advisory board, said, ''We can't afford anymore to break up properties into a thousand small pieces.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can still occasionally find a horse farm in Purchase or Armonk or Chappaqua, but when you get into Bedford you really feel them,'' he said. ''You can see foals this time of year running through the fields, and it only gets better as you go north. But that way of life is like an endangered species.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kristen Carollo, the owner of the 32-acre Courtyard Farm in Bedford Hills since 2001, has established an easement on the property, ensuring that it will remain open space forever, according to Susan Carpenter, the director of land preservation for the land trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't want to ever see houses where this farm is,'' Ms. Carollo. ''It took so much blood, sweat and tears to build our place, and I want to make sure it will always be here.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most pronounced development in banking today is that executives have become bolder as their business has gotten worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy is clearly weaker than expected, and housing prices are falling throughout the land, eroding bank asset values. Yet regulators are on their heels in Washington as bankers and their lobbyists push back against the postcrisis regulations, even publicly condemning the new rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a well-covered exchange, Jamie Dimon, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>'s chief executive, challenged Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, about the costs and benefits of the Dodd-Frank rules. More attention has been paid to the banker's audacity, but the response of the world's most powerful banking regulator was more troubling. Mr. Bernanke scraped and bowed in apology without mentioning the staggering costs of the crisis the banks led us into.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So this is a good occasion to step way back to understand just how good the banks have it today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government, in ways explicit and implicit, profoundly subsidizes and shelters the banking industry. True since the 1930s, it is much more so today. And that makes Mr. Dimon no capitalist colossus astride the Isle of Manhattan, but one of the great welfare queens in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The protection is so well established that we barely notice it anymore. The government supervises bank activities and guarantees deposits. When people walk into a bank, they assume it is as safe as their local supermarket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks are also the mechanism through which we express economic policy, especially as fiscal stimulus has been eliminated as an option. The result is that the government pays a ''vig'' to banks in order to reach its policy goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates to help buoy the economy during a slowdown, banks are the first beneficiaries. As the Fed lowers short-term rates, banks borrow cheaply and lend out for a lot more, making any new lending highly profitable (assuming the banks make good loans). This is classic monetary policy, and supported nearly universally. But let's not pretend that it isn't a boon to banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some think bolstering banks' fortunes is a major goal, not a side effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Fed not only wants to stimulate the economy but also to recapitalize the banks, and this is a stealth technique to do it,'' said Herbert M. Allison Jr., a former investment banker who has turned banking apostate in a new white paper called ''The Megabanks Mess,'' published as a Kindle Single. The reason ''banks aren't doing more lending is that they still hold a lot of troubled assets that tie up equity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the more subtle subsidies and protections. Take regulatory forbearance. In 2009, regulators gave banks a gift on their commercial real estate loans. They allowed banks to look primarily at whether the loans were current, rather than at whether the underlying value of the property had declined. Of course, given the commercial real estate collapse, this had the effect of protecting banks from write-downs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks and regulators say this is justified because an underwater borrower isn't necessarily going to default. True, but it's hard to see how those borrowers - and therefore the banks - are better off for the crash in their collateral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real estate is the least of it. The government is profoundly subsidizing the housing market, too. Hardly a loan gets made today by a bank that isn't guaranteed by either <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> or the Federal Housing Administration. There is no subprime mortgage business outside of the F.H.A. When banks make mortgages and sell the credit risk to the government, they make a quick, safe profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first effect of these policies, for better or worse, is to keep a floor under the housing market. But it also helps banks that own trillions in real estate assets that the government is propping up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another way taxpayers coddle the biggest banks is by implicitly guaranteeing their derivatives business. <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span>, widely viewed as safe and well managed, is a huge beneficiary here. It had $79 billion worth of derivatives on its books in the first quarter. Even if it's hedged, prudent and has thin margins, it's still going to throw off a nice chunk of profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Institutions on the other side of these trades wouldn't enter contracts without believing that they have some underlying protection - protection that comes from the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No sensible person would put a nickel on deposit in the normal course given the enormity and opacity of the derivatives portfolios,'' said Amar Bhide, a former trader and business professor at the Fletcher School. ''It's entirely a function of deposit insurance and the implicit guarantee that the <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> counterparties have.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's actions in the financial crisis only cemented that certainty. Counterparties and investors that were previously not guaranteed, like holders of money market funds, were protected at every turn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This bailout never ended. ''In effect, we nationalized the biggest banks years ago,'' Mr. Allison said. ''We implicitly guaranteed them. The taxpayers are still the ultimate owners of the risk in those banks - they just don't get equity returns for that ownership.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when taxpayers hear a bank chief, like Jamie Dimon, complaining, it's worth keeping in mind that his 10-figure paycheck is largely coming courtesy of us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOUIS FOUNDOS didn't think he would have a problem selling out his new condominium project last fall. It was a renovated building in East Harlem with everything a first-time buyer might want, including granite countertops, dishwashers and washing machines in every unit. It was just a few blocks from the subway, and plenty of new development was under way in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five months later, when not a single one of his 12 condos had sold, he decided it was time for drastic measures. He would break his long-held vow and follow his bank's advice. He would try an auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not an easy decision,'' said Mr. Foundos, the managing partner of FFS Realty of East Meadow, N.Y. ''No one likes to roll the dice when you don't know where they'll go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last weekend Mr. Foundos's building, the Winfield, went on the block. The four units without a reserve price were sold. Opening bids started as low as $149,000, or 60 percent off the previous asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We needed a kick-start, and the auction provided that,'' he said. ''It was kind of what I expected -- getting people through the building was good, and it got good exposure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With few sales, developers like Mr. Foundos, tired of seeing loan payments, taxes and maintenance costs consume the bottom line, are resorting to auctions, in a gamble that selling units at a discount now will be better than sitting on unsold property for another year. In some cases they are trying to sell a building's last remaining units; in others, to prod moribund sales or introduce a property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the housing downturn, condo auctions around the country have increased. But in New York City they have been rare; and in Manhattan, nearly nonexistent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers and lawyers, sensing that the time may be right for residential auctions in New York, have started auction companies, like BidOnTheCity.com and Paramount Realty USA, in the last two years. Established auctioneers, like <span class="companylink">Sheldon Good &amp; Company</span> and Auction.com, have opened offices in Manhattan in expectation of a boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, for all the interest, fewer than 10 live, in-person auctions have taken place in New York City since the housing bubble burst three years ago. Only about 75 units have changed hands in this way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What drives this business is a significant fall in housing prices,'' said Ken Rivkin, an executive vice president of Auction.com, ''and we have not had that in Manhattan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to some predictions, the housing bust was going to create a wave of auctions across the country. But despite an uptick, auctions represent less than 2 percent of the overall residential real estate market nationwide. In 2008, the most recent year for which data are available, $17.1 billion in residential real estate sold at auction, or 1.4 percent of all homes sold, according to the National Auctioneers Association. That figure was $11.5 billion in 2003 and $16 billion in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The majority of homes put up for auction in New York are foreclosures sold in city courthouses or through Auction.com, formerly the Real Estate Disposition Corporation. Foreclosure auctions disposed of 6,621 apartments, single- and two-family homes last year in New York City, according to PropertyShark.com. (Most auction houses avoid foreclosed properties because they don't want the accompanying hassles and uncertainty.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, developers and individual homeowners were loath to auction properties because of the air of desperation associated with the process. Most have been content to list their homes through a traditional brokerage or to wait for the market to recover. Auction houses report that they have come close to signing deals with developers, only to have them back out the minute they sell a few units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What it takes to be a good developer is to be a perpetual optimist,'' said John J. Cuticelli Jr., the chief executive of the <span class="companylink">Sheldon Good &amp; Company</span> auction house in Manhattan. ''What he doesn't realize when you have 100 to 150 units to consume, three or five isn't a velocity of sales to sustain any business model. There's this continual hope that the market will come back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers have had problems selling condominiums because of new Federal Housing Administration rules. The agency will not insure a mortgage unless 30 percent of the units in the building have been sold. Banks, too, have tightened their financing demands and generally will not lend unless 30 to 50 percent of a building is sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's a Catch-22 for a seller,'' Scott Burman, a developer and a founder of Paramount USA, which auctioned the Winfield condos. ''Buyers need mortgages, banks need contracts. Unless you can line up all-cash buyers, it's very difficult to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the relative strength of the New York market, banks here have not been pushing developers to hold auctions as they have in other parts of the country. The average price for a Manhattan apartment is 22.7 percent less than in 2008, according to the real estate appraisal company Miller Samuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auctions were more common in New York in the early 1990s, when they were driven by a wave of co-op conversions and a recession. At the time, sponsors had been hit hard by soaring interest rates and a freeze in financing and mortgages, so they resorted to auctions to sell co-ops whose carrying costs had become too high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The difference between this time and last time is there was tremendous pressure from banks that forced them to move product,'' said Jon Gollinger, the chief executive of Accelerated Marketing Partners, a residential marketing company in Boston that auctions condos. ''It was primarily bank-driven, and this time banks are not driving it. It's extend and pretend,'' he said, alluding to a reluctance to declare loans distressed, in hopes that the economy will pick up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After trying for two years to sell out the Grand at Diamond Beach, a condominium tower on the Jersey Shore, the <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span>, a private equity company, said this month that it would auction 18 units there early next month. Only 34 of 125 condos have sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because of a correction in the national housing market,'' D. Scott Jenkins, a vice president of the <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span>, wrote in an e-mail, ''accurate pricing for the Grand at Diamond Beach is unclear. Auctioning a limited number of residences will allow the market to determine true value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An auction moved the last six units at One Hanson Place in Brooklyn for Canyon Johnson Urban Funds, an investment group, and the Dermot Company, a developer. All penthouses, they had been on the market since 2006. The May auction created a sense of urgency and focused attention on the units, Maria L. Stamolis, a Canyon Johnson fund managing director, said in an e-mail. The auction sold all six for prices ranging from $1.457 million to $2.805 million, including the buyer's premium, a fee charged to the winning bidder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not every auction is a wild success for developers. At the Solaria in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, only 10 apartments sold in the year after the 64-unit tower went on the market at the start of 2008. Joseph Korff, the developer, decided on an auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there were few in attendance when it took place in November 2009. Most bids came in below the reserve -- the minimum price that the seller will accept. Only eight units sold at the auction and in postauction negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On this particular property, I wouldn't do it again,'' said Mr. Korff, the principal at ARC Development in Manhattan. ''I'd want to see a greater public acceptance of a model of marketing inventory, and I'd like to see some successes in Manhattan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is trying other methods of selling the other units, including inducements like free summer camp for buyers' children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auctions are not necessarily deals for buyers, either. Most apartments appearing in auctions have been in less desirable locations, or priced too high for the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many auctions carry a 5 to 10 percent buyer's premium. Some sellers don't disclose the reserve, so the highest bidder may have to wait until after the auction to see if his bid has been accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most auctions I've been aware of are faux auctions because they don't have a disclosed reserve,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal company Miller Samuel. ''The developer decides whether to sell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weekly foreclosure auctions at county courthouses are another option for buyers. Most participants are investors who buy in teams and come with bank checks for thousands of dollars. The winning bidder must be ready to pay 10 percent of the purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Paul started buying foreclosed co-ops eight years ago when he grew tired of making no money as an actor, and he now owns, with relatives and friends, more than 90 apartments in various stages of renovation, legal turmoil and sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The way you make money in this business is volume,'' said Mr. Paul, 33, who lives in a rental apartment. ''The notion that I have $200,000 and invest in a foreclosed apartment and make a lot of money is the stuff of late-night infomercials. There are a million pitfalls.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yamil Martinez and his partner, Enrique Garcia, went to an open house at the New Amsterdam Condominiums in Washington Heights on a lark. They liked the 26 condos that were going on the block, so they obtained financing and attended the auction, conducted in February by Sheldon Good. Their budget was $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within an hour, after first bidding on a penthouse, they had bought a two-bedroom two-bath condo for $304,000, including a 10 percent buyer's premium. In the months since, they have remodeled the kitchen and bathroom, so the place ''looks like an apartment you'd see in SoHo or TriBeCa,'' Mr. Martinez said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're going to get more for your money, more square footage,'' said Mr. Martinez, 28, a restaurateur. ''I think it's a better deal. The buyer's premium didn't bother me. I would have given it to a broker anyway.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Sales of previously owned homes hit a six-month low in May and the supply rose, pointing to a housing market still struggling to regain its footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday that sales slipped 3.8 percent month over month to an annual rate of 4.81 million units, the lowest since November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the second straight month of declines. The drop was smaller than economists had expected, but the April sales figure was revised lower, leaving a report that was largely in line with expectations in financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the fall in sales last month was partly a result of tornadoes and flooding, with sales in the Midwest and South hit the hardest, it underscored fundamental weakness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's indicative of the depressed housing demand that we have been seeing for some time, and that's a function of the slow economic recovery and tight credit markets,'' said Michelle Meyer, an economist at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At May's weak sales pace, it would take 9.3 months to clear the inventory of previously owned homes on the market. That is up from a nine-month supply in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was the latest to confirm a sustained weakness in the economy through the second quarter, which has been marked by a sharp slowdown in regional factory activity, soft retail sales and anemic employment growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the smaller-than-expected decline in sales was yet another hopeful sign that the economy was set to regain momentum in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12 months to May, home resales were down 15.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 3.72 million previously owned homes on the market in May, excluding so-called shadow inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The month's supply was the highest in six months and a supply of six to seven months is generally considered ideal, with higher readings pointing to lower house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The generally weak housing market tone was underscored by the median home price, which at $166,500 was 4.6 percent lower than a year earlier. That compared with a 6.6 percent decline in April.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Since the late 1990s, the once-desolate section of downtown Washington east of the White House has undergone a striking transformation. About $10.6 billion has been invested in more than 150 real estate projects. Some 56,000 people now live downtown, up from 38,000 in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after years of planning, the most ambitious of the downtown projects is finally under way. Construction began in March on CityCenterDC, a $700 million complex envisioned as a modern-day Rockefeller Center, with 2.5 million square feet of office, residential and retail space as well as a public plaza and park. Completion of the bulk of the project is expected in late 2013, according to the two real estate companies, Hines Interests of Houston and Archstone of Englewood, Colo., that won development rights in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the largest downtown projects in the nation, CityCenterDC will fill 10 acres, all city-owned except for the land beneath two condo buildings. Bounded by New York Avenue and 9th, H and 11th Streets NW, the site was once occupied by a convention center that was demolished in 2004 (a year after the larger Walter E. Washington Convention Center was built nearby), leaving a giant parking lot in one of the city's most desirable locations, only two blocks from two of the busiest Metrorail stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This really is the hole in the doughnut,'' said William M. Collins, a senior managing director of Cassidy Turley, a national brokerage, which is not involved in CityCenterDC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CityCenterDC is one of several major projects around the country that were stalled by the recession. But while construction has yet to begin developments like Grand Avenue in Los Angeles and Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn (except for the Nets basketball arena, where work is under way), CityCenterDC was able to move forward because of a recent $620 million equity investment by the real estate arm of the Persian Gulf state of Qatar. The <span class="companylink">Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company</span> is now the project's principal owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complex will be made up of six buildings, 10 and 11 stories in height in keeping with the District of Columbia's 130-foot height restriction. At their base will be 185,000 square feet of retail stores facing the street. An additional 110,000 square feet of retail space is planned for the project's second phase, which will also include a luxury hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To integrate the site with its surroundings, the sections of I and 10th Streets that were cut off to make way for the old convention center will be restored. Alleyways, largely restricted to pedestrians, will run between buildings and provide space for smaller stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two office buildings, with a total of 520,000 square feet, and two condominium buildings, with 216 units, were designed by the prominent London architect Norman Foster's firm, Foster &amp; Partners, whose other projects have included the reconstruction of the Reichstag in Berlin. The two rental apartment buildings, with 458 units, were designed by Shalom Baranes, a local firm that worked on the redevelopment of the Homer building in downtown Washington at 13th and F Streets NW.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though nearly 7,000 new rental units are scheduled to be completed in Washington in the next few years, prospects are good for the apartments because of their central location, said Gregory H. Leisch, the chief executive of Delta Associates, a real estate consulting firm that advises Hines and Archstone. Condo prices in the city center have risen 1.8 percent in the past year, to an average of $710 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demand for office space from law firms and other private tenants -- the space will be too costly for government tenants, said Bill Alsup, a senior vice president of Hines -- is improving, according to Cassidy Turley. But Hines suffered a setback last July, when the national law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom renewed its lease at 1440 New York Avenue NW, rather than fulfilling an earlier plan to lease 350,000 square feet at CityCenterDC. ''It would have been very nice to have had a major tenant commitment prior to the start of construction, but it wasn't critical,'' said Mr. Alsup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Fulcher, an executive vice president at Studley, a brokerage that represents tenants, said most large Washington law firms with leases expiring in 2015 and 2016 had made their real estate decisions because large blocks of space can be scarce in a city without skyscrapers. One exception pursued by the developers is <span class="companylink">Arnold &amp; Porter</span>, which is searching for about 335,000 square feet. But the project's biggest challenge, said Jason Jacobson, a group vice president at Archstone, will be getting the retail mix right. Downtown has a lot of ''fast fashion, geared toward younger people,'' he said. ''Our goal is to bring it up a notch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerry Widdicombe, the director of economic development for the Downtown D.C. Business Improvement District, a group that helps to market the neighborhood, estimated that Washington residents spent as much as $1 billion a year in suburban shopping centers because of a dearth of stores within the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers are seeking a mix of stores, including apparel, home furnishings and electronic goods, said Mr. Alsup, whose company developed and manages Galleria malls in Houston and Dallas. About one-third of the space will be limited to stores new to downtown, he said. Mr. Jacobson said some space along the alleys would be made available to local fledgling retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, the developers are trying to persuade the retailer highest on everyone's list -- Apple, which has one store within the District of Columbia, on Wisconsin Avenue in Georgetown -- to open a much bigger store of 15,000 square feet or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Asadoorian, a regional retail broker, said CityCenterDC's leasing goals demonstrated how downtown had matured. ''Ten years ago, you probably could not have talked about the type of retail they are trying to attract,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the Qatari investors became involved, Hines and Archstone determined that leasing to banks would not help them create lively shopping streets, Mr. Alsup said. But as it happened, their hesitancy on bank branches meshed with the policies of their financial partners, who adhere to the restrictions of Shariah, or Islamic law, including the ban on collecting interest. Restaurants will be able to serve liquor, but retailers whose primary business involves selling alcohol will not be allowed, Mr. Alsup said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their marketing materials, Hines and Archstone say they intend to provide ''an authentic place for urban residents to socialize outside their homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some planning specialists have wondered if people in downtown Washington will view the plaza, which will be situated between the condo and rental buildings, as public space for them to enjoy. ''Putting the plaza in the middle of a large development just feels more private,'' said David Dixon, who is in charge of planning and urban design at Goody Clancy &amp; Associates, a design firm in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jacobson said the developers planned to offer programs in the plaza and would make it welcoming with public art and landscaping. ''People will find it to be inviting,'' he said. ''I realize we have to convince some people. Hopefully, we'll do a better job over the next year or so.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PIN POINT, Ga. -- Clarence Thomas was here promoting his memoir a few years ago when he bumped into Algernon Varn, whose grandfather once ran a seafood cannery that employed Justice Thomas's mother as a crab picker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Varn lived at the old cannery site, a collection of crumbling buildings on a salt marsh just down the road from a sign heralding this remote coastal community outside Savannah as Justice Thomas's birthplace. The justice asked about plans for the property, and Mr. Varn said he hoped it could be preserved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And Clarence said, 'Well, I've got a friend I'm going to put you in touch with,' '' Mr. Varn recalled, adding that he was later told by others not to identify the friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The publicity-shy friend turned out to be Harlan Crow, a Dallas real estate magnate and a major contributor to conservative causes. Mr. Crow stepped in to finance the multimillion-dollar purchase and restoration of the cannery, featuring a museum about the culture and history of Pin Point that has become a pet project of Justice Thomas's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project throws a spotlight on an unusual, and ethically sensitive, friendship that appears to be markedly different from those of other justices on the nation's highest court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two men met in the mid-1990s, a few years after Justice Thomas joined the court. Since then, Mr. Crow has done many favors for the justice and his wife, Virginia, helping finance a Savannah library project dedicated to Justice Thomas, presenting him with a Bible that belonged to Frederick Douglass and reportedly providing $500,000 for Ms. Thomas to start a Tea Party-related group. They have also spent time together at gatherings of prominent Republicans and businesspeople at Mr. Crow's Adirondacks estate and his camp in East Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In several instances, news reports of Mr. Crow's largess provoked controversy and questions, adding fuel to a rising debate about Supreme Court ethics. But Mr. Crow's financing of the museum, his largest such act of generosity, previously unreported, raises the sharpest questions yet -- both about Justice Thomas's extrajudicial activities and about the extent to which the justices should remain exempt from the code of conduct for federal judges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the Supreme Court is not bound by the code, justices have said they adhere to it. Legal ethicists differed on whether Justice Thomas's dealings with Mr. Crow pose a problem under the code. But they agreed that one facet of the relationship was both unusual and important in weighing any ethical implications: Justice Thomas's role in Mr. Crow's donation for the museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The code says judges ''should not personally participate'' in raising money for charitable endeavors, out of concern that donors might feel pressured to give or entitled to favorable treatment from the judge. In addition, judges are not even supposed to know who donates to projects honoring them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the nonprofit Pin Point museum is not intended to honor Justice Thomas, people involved in the project said his role in the community's history would inevitably be part of it, and he participated in a documentary film that is to accompany the exhibits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deborah L. Rhode, a Stanford University law professor who has called for stricter ethics rules for Supreme Court justices, said Justice Thomas ''should not be directly involved in fund-raising activities, no matter how worthy they are or whether he's being centrally honored by the museum.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, the restriction on fund-raising is primarily meant to deter judges from using their position to pressure donors, as opposed to relying on ''a rich friend'' like Mr. Crow, said Ronald D. Rotunda, who teaches legal ethics at Chapman University in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think I could say it's unethical,'' he said. ''It's just a very peculiar situation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice Thomas, through a Supreme Court spokeswoman, declined to respond to a detailed set of questions submitted by The New York Times. Mr. Crow also would not comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supreme Court ethics have been under increasing scrutiny, largely because of the activities of Justice Thomas and Ms. Thomas, whose group, Liberty Central, opposed President Obama's health care overhaul -- an issue likely to wind up before the court. Mr. Crow's donation to Liberty Central was reported by Politico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the liberal advocacy organization Common Cause asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Justices Thomas and Antonin Scalia should have recused themselves from last year's Citizens United campaign finance case because they had attended a political retreat organized by the billionaire Koch brothers, who support groups that stood to benefit from the court's decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A month later, more than 100 law professors asked Congress to extend to Supreme Court justices the ethics code that applies to other federal judges, and a bill addressing the issue was introduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not unusual for justices to accept gifts or take part in outside activities, some with political overtones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice Stephen G. Breyer has attended Renaissance Weekend, a retreat for politicians, artists and media personalities that is a favorite of Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg participated in a symposium sponsored by the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund, and a philanthropic foundation once tried to give her a $100,000 achievement award. She instructed that the money be given to charity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the case of Justice Thomas and his dealings with Mr. Crow, the ethical complications appear more complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservative Ties</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Crow, 61, manages the real estate and investment businesses founded by his late father, Trammell Crow, once the largest landlord in the United States. The Crow family portfolio is worth hundreds of millions of dollars and includes investments in hotels, medical facilities, public equities and hedge funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A friend of the Bush family, Mr. Crow is a trustee of the George Bush Presidential Library Foundation and has donated close to $5 million to Republican campaigns and conservative groups. Among his contributions were $100,000 to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, the group formed to attack the Vietnam War record of Senator John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, and $500,000 to an organization that ran advertisements urging the confirmation of President George W. Bush's nominees to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Crow has not personally been a party to Supreme Court litigation, but his companies have been involved in federal court cases, including four that went to the appellate level. And he has served on the boards of two conservative organizations involved in filing supporting briefs in cases before the Supreme Court. One of them, the American Enterprise Institute, with Mr. Crow as a trustee, gave Justice Thomas a bust of Lincoln valued at $15,000 and praised his jurisprudence at an awards gala in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute's Project on Fair Representation later filed briefs in several cases, and in 2006 the project brought a lawsuit challenging federal voting rights laws, a case in which Justice Thomas filed a lone dissent, embracing the project's arguments. The project director, an institute fellow named Edward Blum, said the institute supported his research but did not finance the brief filings or the Texas suit, which was litigated pro bono by a former clerk of Justice Thomas's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When it came time to file a lawsuit,'' he said, ''A.E.I. had no role in doing that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coming Up With a Plan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to his interest in politics and policy, Mr. Crow is well known for his keen devotion to history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A backyard garden at his $24 million Dallas residence is dominated by old statues of dictators he has collected from fallen regimes, including Lenin and Stalin. His private library is packed with 8,000 rare books and artifacts, including a Senate roll call sheet from Justice Thomas's confirmation and a ''thank you'' letter from the justice, according to local news reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a number of reasons Justice Thomas might be thankful to Mr. Crow. In addition to giving him the Douglass Bible, valued 10 years ago at $19,000, Mr. Crow has hosted the justice aboard his private jet and his 161-foot yacht, at the exclusive Bohemian Grove retreat in California and at his grand Adirondacks summer estate called Topridge, a 105-acre spread that once belonged to Marjorie Merriweather Post, the cereal heiress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Shaw, a folk singer who said he had been invited several times to perform at Topridge, recalled seeing Justice Thomas and his family ''on one or two occasions.'' They were among about two dozen guests who included other prominent Republicans -- last summer, the younger Mr. Bush stopped by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There would be guys puffing on cigars,'' Mr. Shaw said. ''Clarence just kind of melted in with everyone else. We got introduced at dinner. He sat at Harlan's table.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Crow's $175,000 donation to the library in Savannah in 2001 started out anonymous, but it was eventually made public amid opposition to the project by some local black leaders who did not like Justice Thomas's politics. Similarly, Mr. Crow sought to keep his role in the museum quiet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance the Pin Point Heritage Museum, scheduled to open this fall, would seem an unlikely catalyst for an ethical quandary. That Pin Point's history is worthy of preservation is not in dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor designated by Congress, it is representative of tight-knit Southern coastal settlements that trace their roots to freed slaves and were often based around fishing. In Pin Point, the Varn crab and oyster cannery, founded in the 1920s, was a primary source of jobs until it closed in 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Varn and his wife, Sharon, said they had long hoped the property could be saved from commercial development but had little success coming up with a plan. That changed after their chance encounter with Justice Thomas, who was visiting his childhood home with a television news crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice Thomas, 62, was born and raised near the cannery overlooking the Moon River, where it was not uncommon for babies to rock in bassinets made of crab baskets while their mothers shucked oysters. He sympathized with the Varns' wishes and said he had a friend who could help, Mr. Varn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Varns eventually sold their property in April 2008. During a recent interview at their home near the cannery, they made it clear that they were ''not supposed to say'' who the buyer was, and a news release issued last November by a Savannah public relations firm said the museum was being ''privately funded by an anonymous donor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the paper trail leads back to Mr. Crow, and in interviews at the project site, people working on it acknowledged that he was financing it. Property records show a company called HKJRS/Pinpoint bought the land for $1.5 million, and incorporation records say the company is controlled by a Dallas-based partnership run by Mr. Crow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project documents reviewed by The Times show a preliminary construction budget of $1.3 million, but it is unclear if that includes expenses related to the content and design of the museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice Thomas remains closely involved with the project. Emily Owens, a museum spokeswoman who works for Mr. Crow's company, said the justice ''played a big part'' in creating a video documentary that will be part of the museum experience. He hosted a design team from Dallas for a four-hour meeting at his Supreme Court offices in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he has had a role in picking people to help with the museum. Barbara Fertig, a history professor at Armstrong Atlantic State University in Savannah, said that she was asked to meet with Justice Thomas last spring and that ''by the end of the meeting, he said he would like me to work on this project.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she had ''never been particularly curious'' about why Mr. Crow is financing it, adding that costly preservation projects are often possible only because of philanthropy motivated by friendships. Justice Thomas and Mr. Crow would seem to fall into that category, Ms. Fertig said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been in the company of the two of them together,'' she said, ''and they certainly really are friends.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Code of Conduct</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That friendship is important to determining whether Justice Thomas's interactions with Mr. Crow conflict with the code, said Raymond J. McKoski, a retired state judge in Illinois who wrote a law review article on charitable fund-raising by judges. If Justice Thomas did not ''misuse the prestige of office'' in getting Mr. Crow to take on the project, it should not be a concern, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some of it depends on the conversations that took place,'' Mr. McKoski said. ''Who brought up the idea? How willing was Mr. Crow to do it? What exact questions were asked by Justice Thomas?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the admonition against fund-raising, the code generally discourages judges from partaking in any off-the-bench behavior that could create even the perception of partiality. It acknowledges the value in judges' being engaged with their communities, lecturing on the law and doing charitable work, but draws a line where those activities might cause a reasonable person to worry that a judge is indebted to or influenced by someone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The code of conduct is quite clear that judges are not supposed to be soliciting money for their pet projects or charities, period,'' said Arn Pearson, a lawyer with Common Cause. ''If any other federal judge was doing it, he could face disciplinary action.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The justices are not bound by the federal judiciary's conduct code, because it is enforced by a committee of judges who rank below the justices. Even so, Justices Breyer and Anthony M. Kennedy said in testimony before Congress in April that the justices followed the code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the code, the justices must comply with laws applying to all federal officials that prohibit conflicts of interest and require disclosure of gifts. Justice Thomas's gift acceptances drew attention in 2004, when The Los Angeles Times reported that he had accumulated gifts totaling $42,200 in the previous six years -- far more than any of the other justices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2004, Justice Thomas has never reported another gift. He has continued to disclose travel costs paid by schools and organizations he has visited for speeches and teaching, but he has not reported that any travel was provided by Mr. Crow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Travel records for Mr. Crow's planes and yacht, however, suggest that Justice Thomas may have used them in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April 2008, not long after Mr. Crow bought the Pin Point property, one of his private planes flew from Washington to Savannah, where his yacht, the Michaela Rose, was docked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That same week, an item appeared in a South Carolina lawyers' publication noting that Justice Thomas was arriving aboard the Michaela Rose in Charleston, a couple of hours north of Savannah, where the Crow family owns luxury vacation properties. The author was a prominent lawyer who said she knew of the visit because of a family connection to Mr. Crow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice Thomas reported no gifts of travel that month in his 2008 disclosure. And there are other instances in which Justice Thomas's travels correspond to flights taken by Mr. Crow's planes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Jan. 4, 2010, when Justice Thomas was in Savannah for the dedication of a building in his honor, Mr. Crow's plane flew from Washington to Savannah and returned to Washington the next day. Justice Thomas reported in his financial disclosure that his travel had been paid for by the Savannah College of Art and Design, which owned the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his 2009 financial disclosure, Justice Thomas reported that Southern Methodist University in Dallas -- Trammell Crow's alma mater -- had provided his travel for a speech there on Sept. 30. Flight records show that Mr. Crow's plane flew from Washington to Dallas that day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the questions The Times submitted to Justice Thomas was whether he was on any of those flights, and if so, whether the colleges reimbursed him or Mr. Crow. The colleges declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One item not required to be reported in Justice Thomas's financial disclosures is the millions of dollars Mr. Crow is spending on the museum. That is because the money is not being given to the justice as a gift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Algernon and Sharon Varn, who said they were thrilled to see a cherished piece of local history being restored, the museum is a gift to the community. While it is about more than Justice Thomas, they said, he deserves credit for putting them together with someone who had the money and the interest to make the project a reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He was instrumental in getting the process started, because he wanted it preserved to show that no matter where you came from, you can go where you want,'' Mr. Varn said. ''He had a meager existence, and yet look where he is today. It's a great American story.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR some parents, an engraved pen set just won't cut it as a graduation present. It seems so insubstantial, so unoriginal. Anyway, the kid will just lose it. So how about a New York apartment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate brokers say that in the last year, they have seen more parents shopping for apartments for their grown children, hoping to take advantage of low mortgage rates and apartment prices that are still about 20 percent down from the market's peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I got a digital watch for graduation,'' said Barry Silverman, an executive vice president of Halstead Property, ''but I've worked with families where the children are getting an apartment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These congratulatory apartments are often studios or small one-bedrooms, but on occasion they are bigger-ticket items, he said, because ''the parents see it as a long-term investment and a good place to park their money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, brokers say, the parents do not live in the New York area and view the apartment as a potential pied-a-terre for themselves when the child decides to move on. Some buy it as a straight-out gift, a gesture of profound affection sweetened by the current generous tax exclusion. Others buy it as an investment and retain ownership, and still others acquire it through a family trust for joint ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These purchases raise a number of financial and estate planning questions, and lawyers and building managers advise parents to structure the arrangement carefully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are tax implications to think about, building rules to consider, and the question of access -- as in do the parents have a right to stay there or drop in whenever they want?'' said Roberta Axelrod, the director of residential sales and rentals at Time Equities, a real estate developer and management company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also more mundane issues to be hammered out, like who pays the maintenance, who pays for any work that needs to be done, and who gets any profits when the apartment is sold. Ms. Axelrod said she had seen families signing formal agreements and families making verbal agreements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But more often than not,'' she said, ''people don't talk about the future, and that leads to tension when they find out that everybody has a different idea about it. It's important that the different parties all understand and agree in advance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Wagner, a real estate lawyer, said that because family circumstances vary and buildings have different practices, ''each situation dictates what will make sense.'' He advised putting agreements in writing, but added that ''legal documents have to be drafted, because there are no standard forms that deal with this stuff.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the simplest scenarios, the parents buy and keep an apartment in their name and agree to pay the monthly carrying costs, and the child lives there as a family member, not a renter. Condos permit this, but some co-ops allow only owners to be residents and may require that the child's name be put on the proprietary lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Policarpio, a vice president of Brown Harris Stevens, said that when he helped Lisa Zia find a studio for her son, Sean, they focused on condos, but when they came across ''a co-op on the more liberal side of things'' that would allow subletting, they bought it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zia, who lives in Huntington Beach, Calif., said that a subleasable studio was crucial because Sean, who is 21 and just graduated from a professional musical theater program, may go on tour for long stretches of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I decided that since New York is his home now, we might as well look for someplace more permanent for him,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They closed on the studio, on West 34th Street, for less than $265,000 in December, and both mother and son are on the proprietary lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With the interest rate and the price that we found,'' Ms. Zia said, ''we couldn't not do it. He may never see a time when he can afford to buy in New York again. The ultimate goal is for him to be up on his feet and then take it over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, though, Ms. Zia admits, she can't help being a mom. She was appalled when she visited last month for his graduation. ''It wasn't weeks' and weeks' worth of mess,'' she said, ''but it was bad.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zia, who had been sharing the space with a roommate, said cleaning had fallen by the wayside in the final weeks of school. ''Now that I realize it upsets her that much,'' he said, ''I'm going to be more adamant about staying on top of things. We don't want to go through this again the next time she comes up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marina Santos, 22, graduated from Ashland University last year, and when she decided to come to New York to pursue a career in television, she asked her parents, Marcos and Marli Santos, who live in Copley, Ohio, if they could help with her rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They decided it would be wiser to buy a studio apartment in their names and allow Marina to live there, rent free. They found a $250,000 studio in a co-op building with a doorman on West 57th Street. Then they learned that banks viewed the place as an investment property and not a second home. Banks often charge higher mortgage rates and require higher down payments for investment purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenn Busch, a tax lawyer, says that when parents are buying property for a child, there are many ''traps for the unwary.'' Some buildings require both parents and child to be listed on the proprietary lease. Many co-ops frown on buying a property in a child's name, because the child may not meet the co-op's income requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when a property stays in the parents' names, as the Santoses planned, its classification as a second residence or investment property can have financial consequences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From one bank, Mr. Santos said, they could not get the mortgage they wanted; when negotiations with a second bank stalled, he told their broker, Diana Bustamante, an agent with Brown Harris Stevens, ''I'm going to give up and pay cash.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Bustamante urged patience, and they eventually secured a mortgage with a good rate. The younger Ms. Santos moved into the studio in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The whole process was long and painful,'' her father said, ''but I believe it was worth it, because we know she is living in a safe and good place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Santos is easing herself into the cold reality of housing costs by paying the maintenance fee, $650 a month, to her father. Without her parents' help, she said, ''I wouldn't be able to live in Manhattan, and I would definitely have roommates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hopefully, in a few years, I'll be more established in my career and I'll be able to get something bigger.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mystery shrouding so many New York co-ops flummoxed Dr. Jerry Waldman and his wife, Patti, who live in Laguna Beach, Calif. Their search for a co-op for their daughter, Olivia, was thoroughly discouraging. After being rejected by one co-op board and having two other offers on co-ops fall through, they decided to look for a condo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't want to go through that process again,'' Dr. Waldman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A condo is the easiest type of apartment for parents to buy for a child, especially a condo from a sponsor or in a new development, which has few buying restrictions and no board interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Waldmans eventually bought a two-bedroom condo for $1.15 million on East 72nd Street, a few blocks from where Olivia Waldman, 31, works as a physician's assistant in surgery. A doorman building, it was recently renovated and outfitted with amenities like a spa, a climbing wall and a basketball court. Norma Jean Nesheim, the building's sales director, said that about a dozen parents had bought apartments there for children in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It still feels too good to be true,'' said Ms. Waldman, who moved into the apartment in February. ''This helps me financially and I get to live in a fabulous apartment I couldn't afford on my own.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment is owned jointly through a family trust, with Ms. Waldman owning one-fifth and the rest belonging to her parents. The Waldmans structured it that way because they have four other daughters and want to give each the option to buy a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't buy this place for Olivia,'' Dr. Waldman said. ''We bought it as a family place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some parents choose to make an official gift of an apartment by putting it in the child's name. Richard Koenigsberg, a certified public accountant, thinks that these gifts can be a good idea. ''We are in a remarkable period of time at the moment,'' he said, because the tax exclusion on gifts and estates has been raised to $5 million from $1 million until the end of 2012. This means that a parent can give a child as much as $5 million tax free; if two parents are involved, make that $10 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a big opportunity for parents who might want to help their children,'' Mr. Koenigsberg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Peter Clagnaz and his wife, Roban, took advantage of the gift exclusion about a year ago when they bought a two-bedroom apartment on East 88th Street for their twins, Evan and Joanna. At the time, the gift exclusion was $1 million and the apartment cost about $800,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a great price,'' Dr. Clagnaz said, ''and it was a way for us financially to give them money without having to die. It's going to come out of their inheritance one way or another; why not let them enjoy it now?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife live in North Carolina, where he is a psychiatrist. In addition to consulting with their accountant, he said, they brought in a lawyer to make sure that a third child, an older brother, would eventually receive an equivalent amount of their estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It got complicated and it was a lot to think about,'' Dr. Clagnaz said. ''But we liked the idea that this apartment was going to be theirs once we had gifted it to them. It was a way of helping them become independent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evan Clagnaz, 26, moved to New York about six years ago to attend Fordham University and is now a manager at the Upper East Side restaurant Vivolo. His sister followed two years later. The recent recipient of a master's degree in education, she plans to teach English as a second language.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their family's broker, Gene Fein, a vice president of Stribling &amp; Associates, said that some co-ops would have required the Clagnazes to own the apartment jointly with their children or asked the parents to be financial guarantors. The Clagnazes' building allowed them to buy in the twins' names, but requested a letter ''saying the parents would stand behind them,'' Ms. Fein said. The building also asked Evan and Joanna to put a year's worth of maintenance in escrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evan Clagnaz said his parents had made it clear that the apartment was his and his sister's responsibility. ''So if anything happens and it needs work,'' he said, it is clear who needs to handle the costs involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But their parents also said that if one of them were to get a job elsewhere or decide to move in with someone else, the remaining sibling could get a roommate, or the parents could buy him or her out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All four Clagnazes attended the co-op board interview, at which Dr. Clagnaz was asked what would happen if he were to die, presumably out of concern that the building would no longer be able to count on him as the twins' financial backup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Clagnaz had a quick response. ''I said, 'Well, then they get all the money and not just the apartment.' ''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANGIE RIBOWSKY and her husband, Ian, love almost everything about their four-bedroom center-hall colonial in Scarsdale. Built in 1927, it has the charm of a prewar house, along with an updated kitchen, lots of nooks and crannies, and ample room for a family of four.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What they do not love is the garage. Typical of houses built in southern and central Westchester County during the 1920s and '30s, the garage is tiny by modern standards -- wide enough to hold Mrs. Ribowsky's late-model Toyota, but so narrow she can't open the door once she maneuvers the car in. As for her husband's S.U.V., it is too broad to make it through the garage door. Consequently, both cars must be parked in the small driveway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ribowskys are on the verge of buying a third car, for their daughters, Alana, 20, and Sasha, 19, but it will have to be something along the lines of a Mini Cooper or a small <span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span>, their mother said, because ''we're simply out of room; at least one car has to fit in that garage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the estates in the northern part of the county have many garages, and large ones at that. ''They're the dream of car collectors,'' said Sally Slater, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Bedford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Slater is marketing a 1973 Pound Ridge contemporary, renovated in 1998, on 7.5 acres. With six bedrooms, five and a half baths and an asking price of $3.995 million, the house also has an eight-car heated and air-conditioned garage, with a central vacuum system and Pirelli black rubber flooring. The listing sheet describes it as ''designed for privileged cars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many people in this neck of the woods collect cars,'' Ms. Slater said, ''and when the weather is nice, it's not uncommon to see the likes of Ralph Lauren tootling around town in one of his favorites.'' (Mr. Lauren, the fashion designer, has a garage with stainless-steel counters, halogen lights and about 60 of the rarest cars in the world.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Cynthia Jaffee, a broker for Houlihan Lawrence in Bedford, most prospective buyers in the Bedford-Pound Ridge area turn up their noses at a two-car or even a three-car garage. ''We see buyers moving here from down-county, where garage space is at a premium, because they don't want to have to rent space for their beloved Lamborghinis,'' she said. Ms. Jaffee is the listing agent for a seven-bedroom house on 4.6 acres in Bedford Hills. On the market for $6.95 million, the property has two garages: one for seven cars and another for four.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are garages that are ''more than just garages,'' said Lynn Harmonay, a broker for Sotheby's North Country International Realty in Chappaqua. Garages with accessory apartments add value to a house because they can be used as caretaker quarters or as rental apartments, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the vast majority of car accommodations fall somewhere in between the Ribowskys' minuscule one in Scarsdale and the 11-car storage capacity of Ms. Jaffee's listing in Bedford Hills. Even in southern Westchester, where large lots are less common, most new houses have room for at least two cars, said Domenic Zagaroli, the owner of Zagaroli Appraisers in Harrison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically the resale value of houses in the $1 million-plus range suffers if they do not have at least a three-car garage, said Mr. Zagaroli, past president of both the Westchester County Society of Real Estate Appraisers and the New York State Society of Real Estate Appraisers. ''If the house only has a two-car garage,'' he said, ''it can detract as much as $15,000 from the price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zagaroli, who has been an appraiser for 34 years, has seen many extremes in his day. He recalled a Purchase property that had a seven-car garage because the owner wanted to drive a different car every day of the week. Now, he said, buying an older house with a seven-foot-wide garage is tantamount to ''having a house with no garage at all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In cases like that -- ''where the garage is so small it's not practical,'' said Ed Ferguson, the senior vice president of Julia B. Fee Sotheby's International Realty in Scarsdale -- owners often convert the garage to living space. The garage doors remain in place, but behind them is an interior wall and a family room, an extra bedroom or a home office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the short run, that's a real gain for the owners,'' Mr. Ferguson said. ''But in the long run, when they go to sell it, it may not be to the next buyer's liking. Often, though, it's a plus, because if the garage isn't usable as a garage, the conversion has already been done and the new owners don't have to worry about that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Very occasionally, real estate agents still come across an older house with neither garage nor driveway. Such was the case a few years ago in Pelham, recalled Sona Davidian, a broker-owner for McClellan Sotheby's International Realty. The house, a 1912 colonial with four bedrooms and three baths, was owned by a woman who had always walked to town to shop and hopped on a train at the nearby <span class="companylink">Metro-North Railroad</span> station when she ventured into Manhattan. When the house was sold, the new owners blasted into rock in the front yard to create a driveway. But there wasn't room for a garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Pelham may be a very walkable town,'' Ms. Davidian said, ''but sometimes you do want to go to Lord &amp; Taylor, and for that you need a car. Maybe not a garage, but at least a driveway.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week and builders broke ground on more homes in May. The latest data offered some hope that the economy may be improving after hitting a recent slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment benefit applications fell to a seasonally adjusted 414,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. It was the second drop in three weeks and a positive sign that layoffs are slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, applications have been above 400,000 for 10 consecutive weeks, evidence that the job market is weak compared with earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction rose last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 560,000 units a year, the Commerce Department said. Economists say the pace of construction is far below the 1.2 million homes a year that must be built to sustain a healthy home building industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment applications had fallen to 375,000 in February, a level that signals sustainable job growth. They stayed below 400,000 for seven of nine weeks. But applications surged in April to 478,000 -- an eight-month high -- and they have declined slowly since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the steady decline in unemployment applications signaled that the job market was improving, but at a very slow pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is not a derailing of the economy,'' said Bricklin Dwyer, an economist at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>. ''This is a period of weak growth, and we're going to see this for some time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The elevated level of applications suggests that companies pulled back on hiring in the face of higher gas and food prices, which have cut into consumer spending. Hiring has slowed sharply since applications rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers added only 54,000 net new jobs in May, much slower than the average gain of 220,000 a month in the previous three months. The unemployment rate rose to 9.1 percent from 9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers probably added more jobs in June than in May, but less than the 220,000 pace from earlier this year, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More hiring is important because it is critical to increasing consumers' incomes, which in turn would fuel more spending. Consumer spending grew at a weak 2.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, down from 4 percent in the previous quarter. That pushed down economic growth to 1.8 percent, from 3.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the job market was improving earlier this year, home building is coming off the two worst years on records dating back five decades. And the May data suggests that will not change anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of single-family homes started in May rose a modest 3.7 percent. But the construction pace of single-family homes, which accounts for about 80 percent of all residential construction, is well below the 2010 rate. Construction of those traditional homes is ''still very much dead in the water,'' said Mark Vitner, senior economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing permits, a gauge of future construction, rose last month to the highest level since December. But apartment and condominium construction accounted for a large portion of that increase. Renting has become a preferred option for many Americans who lost their jobs in the recession and were forced to leave their rapidly depreciating homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though new homes represent a small fraction of the overall housing market, they have an outsize influence on the economy. Each home built generates, on average, three jobs and $90,000 in taxes, according to the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factory output, which has been one of the strongest sectors of the economy since the recession ended two years ago, has also slowed this spring. And it may be getting worse in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said on Thursday that its regional index of manufacturing conditions dropped to minus 7.7 in June, down from 3.9 in May. It was the first negative reading since last September and the lowest reading for the index since July 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index tracks manufacturing conditions in the region covered by the Philadelphia Fed. That includes eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A six-bedroom Victorian town house in the West End of Glasgow</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">875,000 pounds ($1.4 million)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This three-story semidetached town house in the Victorian style is in the fashionable Kelvinside neighborhood in the West End of Glasgow, Scotland's largest city.The West End is known for its Victorian and Edwardian architectural gems originally designed for Scottish merchants. Many of the structures have been converted into apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This stately blond sandstone home, built around 1895, remains a single-family dwelling, with a private screened garden and a gravel driveway for off-street parking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With about 3,000 square feet of space and gas-fueled central heating, the town house has six bedrooms and four bathrooms, as well as two drawing rooms with bay windows; a dining room and a kitchen; and an impressive entrance and reception hall with Corinthian columns, a Romanesque floor mosaic and a mahogany fireplace. A stairway of stone and carved mahogany leads to a half-landing, which has a 10-by-20-foot window of leaded stained glass depicting a maiden surrounded by flowers and birds. Above the staircase, a large Victorian cupola with a glass skylight filters light into the top level of the house, which has four of the bedrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the ornate cornicing, friezes, wainscoting and ceiling roses in every room, the house has sliding windows with interior shutters, which have been refurbished, and 13-foot ceilings. There are also several grand hearths: the ground-floor drawing room has an elaborate carved mahogany fireplace inset with a gas stove, under an original overmantel mirror; the second-floor drawing room, with a banquette lining its bay windows, has a carved mahogany mantelpiece and a cast-iron fireplace with an open fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most floors in the house are original red timber or parquet, though those in the dining area and kitchen, in the rear of the house, are tiled in black slate. The kitchen is simple and contemporary, with high-gloss white cabinets, Formica countertops and an imposing stainless steel oven and stovetop hood by the Italian appliance-maker Smeg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One floor up, the master bath has an original stained-glass window depicting pale fruit, which filters light onto an old-fashioned porcelain tub on a heavy wooden frame. The bathroom is outfitted with <span class="companylink">Duravit</span> fixtures, by the French designer Philippe Starck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tall windows at the back look out onto a companion cottage with its own garden -- a property sold last year, according to the town house's owner, Judith Hardy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quiet Kelvinside neighborhood is less than four miles from the mostly commercial city center. The West End is perhaps Glasgow's most consistently popular neighborhood for residential living, offering trendy bars, restaurants and shops along with gracious period homes. This home is about a 10-minute drive from Glasgow International Airport, Ms. Hardy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKET OVERVIEW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After explosive growth, sometimes by as much as 25 percent a year, between 2001 and 2007, Glasgow's housing prices fell 20 to 25 percent in 2008, said Iain K. Robb, a partner in the Glasgow office of <span class="companylink">Strutt &amp; Parker</span>, one of the larger real estate agencies in the United Kingdom. Mr. Robb said he didn't anticipate a full recovery for perhaps another couple of years. Still, the West End is somewhat anomalous, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The West End of Glasgow is quite quiet right at the moment,'' said Emily Cathcart, a sales manager for the real estate firm Rettie &amp; Co., and the listing agent for this home, ''but it's almost like a niche market that always stays good. There are lots of different types of properties -- conversions, tenement flats, town houses -- and prices have stayed relatively high here compared to other areas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An average price for a West End period property might be in the low to middle $700,000s, but that can vary significantly depending on location, size and historic detail. In recent years, Mr. Robb said, period homes have been priced as high as $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Kelvinside home, which has been on the market about three months, is priced ''just right,'' Ms. Cathcart said. ''The high end of the market is just quieter right now,'' she said, ''so it's not sold yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, there are very few historic West End homes on the market. This is most likely because owners overpaid for them during the boom years, and believe they would not get their money back if those homes were sold now, according to A. Murray Houston, a valuation surveyor with A. &amp; S. Ireland, a law and real estate firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO BUYS IN GLASGOW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Areas like St. Andrews and Edinburgh see many foreign buyers, particularly from the rest of Europe and the United States, but such buyers represent only a fraction of the market in Glasgow, brokers said. Most foreigners come to Glasgow for work purposes; either they rent, or their companies provide them with housing options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those coming from abroad and buying homes in Glasgow often have a connection to the city or are repatriating, Ms. Cathcart said.Otherwise, the great majority of buyers are already residents of the city or suburbs, or are from West Scotland, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYING BASICS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no restrictions on overseas buyers. Historically in Scotland, real estate sales have been handled by lawyers, not brokers, and in many areas that tradition still holds true. Glasgow, however, is not one of those areas. Most of its sales are handled by brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since January 2009, sellers have been legally required to commission a surveyor to produce a ''home report'' for potential buyers and lenders, offering a rundown of amenities, along with condition and value, Mr. Houston said. An initial step in buying is now a request for that report from the agent. The buyer then typically hires a solicitor to draw up the offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most solicitors charge no fees until an offer is accepted. But at that point most buyers can anticipate paying the solicitor a flat rate of about $980 to $1,310, which includes a land registry fee, Ms. Cathcart said. There is also a stamp duty, which is 1 percent of the sales price for homes valued from $205,000 to $409,000; 3 percent for homes valued from $409,000 to $818,000; and 4 percent for homes valued higher than $818,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because lending standards have tightened considerably since the global economic downturn, overseas buyers may have difficulty obtaining financing from Scottish or British banks unless they have proof of residency or an employment contract, Mr. Houston said. While mortgages can vary substantially, a typical 20- or 25-year loan might require 20 to 25 percent down, with an interest rate of about 5 percent, brokers said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA -- A package arrived on a shabby north Philadelphia block in January 2010, wrapped in Tyvek and measuring 55 feet long and 16 feet wide. Inside was a kitchenette, a bathroom and two bedrooms. The only thing missing was the toilet bowl lid. Just six weeks -- and 88 similar packages -- later, the Modules at Templetown, a four-story student-housing complex of 80,000 square feet near Temple University here, had completely risen from its concrete foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technique used to build the Modules, modular construction or prefab, in which major components are assembled off-site, has a long history in the single-family housing market, but its place in the commercial field has been limited. Currently just 1 percent of the commercial building market is prefab, mostly limited to schools, hospitals, dormitories or retail stores, although the largest modular building in the country is a 21-story Hilton hotel in San Antonio that was erected in 1968.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with an emphasis on materials conservation and reuse, and developers looking to squeeze costs any way they can, modular construction is getting a closer look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often the word prefab conjures images of inexpensive and poorly built structures like trailer homes. But proponents of prefab, many of whom shudder at the moniker, say that modular design done well is anything but cheaply built. A modularly constructed building uses the same materials as a traditional one. But because it is made in a factory, workers are not battling the elements and can construct it more soundly and with less waste, proponents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The quality of what you can assemble is infinitely higher on a factory floor,'' said the hotelier Andre Balazs, who considered building a luxury modular hotel atop the High Line in Manhattan, but abandoned the idea when he found it too costly in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Balazs said he was in discussions with manufacturers in Europe to build individual hotel units abroad and ship them to this country to assemble a boutique hotel in Los Angeles, a process that could be replicated in other cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly all contemporary buildings rely on some element of prefabrication, with facades largely constructed off-site and windows and doors standardized. Even ''bathroom pods,'' bathrooms built and assembled off-site, are becoming increasingly common. But the idea of building most of the building in a factory and setting it atop a foundation simply has not taken off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Is the technology there to do it? Yes. Is the desire? Yes,'' said Christopher Sharples, a principal at SHoP Architects, which is designing a possible 34-story prefab tower for the developer Forest City Ratner at Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn. ''In the near future, I think people are going to become more educated about what the potential of this approach could be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market share of commercial modular construction is poised to increase in the next five years, according to the Modular Building Institute, an industry trade group. In addition to the possibility of a tower at Atlantic Yards, an eight-story modular apartment building is scheduled to break ground this summer in the University City section of Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A developer can expect to shave up to 20 percent off construction costs with modular building largely because labor costs are lower. A unionized New York City carpenter makes about $85 an hour, including benefits, when he works at a construction site. At Capsys in Brooklyn, the only modular factory in the city, a comparable worker makes less than $30 an hour plus benefits. Many modular factories are not unionized and pay even less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a disaster for construction workers,'' said Gary Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in western Massachusetts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers also benefit from time savings. Speed aside, builders have the ability to create a production schedule that minimizes downtime. In traditional construction, a contractor is overseeing work by various subcontractors who work for separate entities and on their own schedules. Weather can cause delays and so can any number of unforeseen factors like waits for zoning approvals. But in a factory, all the various tradesmen from the plumbers to the carpenters to the electricians work for the factory, and all the pieces come together simultaneously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It never rains inside our building, it never snows,'' said Tom O'Hara, the director of business development for Capsys, an 80,000-square-foot factory in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. ''We can make very airtight buildings.'' One of their projects, a luxury hotel on the North Fork of Long Island, was able to open in the spring of 2005, before the start of the lucrative summer season, largely because of the modular construction schedule, Mr. O'Hara said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, prefab has its own set of limitations. It is uncharted territory for most architects, developers and contractors, who are hesitant to take any risks in a tenuous market. Every decision, from the color of the bathroom tile to the knobs on kitchen cabinets, must be made before construction begins. And the building must be designed so it can fit in boxes that meet Federal Highway Administration regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looks simpler than it is,'' said Jonathan Weiss, the president of Equinox Management and Construction, the developer of the Modules in Philadelphia. ''There's an awful lot of coordination.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weiss said the $9.5 million building would have cost 25 percent more and would have taken 15 months instead of eight had it been built traditionally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modernist building has boxy orange windows jutting out from a gray stucco facade that masks the boxes behind it. The facade was built on-site along with several other elements like the hallway stairwells and the mechanical elements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You really do need to embrace the modular constraints,'' said the building's architect, Brian Phillips of Interface Studio Architects. ''That's where you save time and money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An untrained eye could never tell the building was built anywhere but on-site. The units have modern kitchenettes; large, airy bedrooms; wood floors and chalkboard apartment doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone's always fascinated when I tell them I live in the Modules,'' said Timothy Archer, a Temple University junior who was sitting on the building's roof deck garden one recent morning sipping a glass of red wine. Rents start at $1,300 a month for an unfurnished two-bedroom unit, according to the building's Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge of making a prefabricated building architecturally innovative is part of what drives architects like James Garrison, the principal of Garrison Architects, who designed a Scandinavian-style modular apartment at an adolescent treatment center in Albion, Mich. With floor-to-ceiling windows looking out over a lake, the steel-framed Koby Cottage was built in a factory; even the furniture was installed off-site. The 1,100-square-foot structure was put together on-site in a single day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summer work is to start on a two-story modular child care center at Lehman College in the Bronx that Mr. Garrison also designed. At $6 million, the building will cost the City University of New York half of what it would have cost and take half the time to build had it been built on-site, said Iris Weinshall, the vice chancellor for facilities, planning and construction at CUNY.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center will be constructed of 20 boxes brought to the campus on a truck from a factory in Ephrata, Pa., and Garrison Architects says it will take a week to assemble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Garrison offset the two stories and added trellises for vines on the building's facade that run alongside thin vertical glass louvers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't want it to look like a set of boxes produced in a factory,'' said Mr. Garrison.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE origins of the current economic crisis can be traced to a particular kind of social epidemic: a speculative bubble that generated pervasive optimism and complacency. That epidemic has run its course. But we are now living with the malaise it caused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News accounts of the economic crisis rarely put it in these terms. They tend to focus on distinct short-term developments or on the roles of prominent people like Federal Reserve governors, members of Congress or Wall Street financiers. These stories grab attention and may be supported by some of the economic statistics that the government and private institutions collect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the economic situation is primarily driven by hard-to-quantify sociological factors that play out over many years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uptick in the unemployment rate, to 9.1 percent from 8.8 percent two months earlier and the drop in stock prices over the last month have attracted notice, yet in a sense they are symptoms of a deeper economic sickness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate prices have been a significant indicator of this ailment. An unprecedented bubble in American home prices started in 1997 and ended five years ago. Home prices rose 131 percent in that time, or 85 percent in real inflation-corrected terms, according to the S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller National Home Price index. (I helped to develop that index, along with Karl Case of Wellesley College.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the same time, there were bubbles in the nation's commercial real estate and farmland. And there were real estate bubbles in many other countries, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider this: Home prices rose nearly 10 percent a year on average in the United States from 1997 to 2006, long enough for many people to become accustomed to the pace and to view it as normal. The conventional 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.8 percent over those years, far below the appreciation rate on housing, so even if you had a substantial mortgage, you were becoming wealthier by the day, at least on paper. People who owned a home over that period had reason to feel pretty well off and proud of their investment acumen. That fed a contagion of optimism and helped to drive the speculative bubble, propelling the economy and the stock market in a feedback loop that repeated year after year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Case and I have conducted annual spring surveys of home-buyer attitudes for many years. We ask about long-term expectations: ''On average over the next 10 years how much do you expect the value of your property to change each year?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey we conducted in spring 2005, near the end of the bubble, included 407 home buyers. In it, the median expectation for home price appreciation over the next decade -- until 2015 -- was 7 percent a year. That is substantially less than the 10 percent a year that Americans had recently experienced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But expected increases of 7 percent a year still implied another doubling of home prices by 2015. And about a quarter of our respondents in 2005 anticipated increases of at least 15 percent a year for the next decade. Something was very wrong with this picture, but few noticed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it turned out, of course, those expected increases didn't happen. Instead, home prices tumbled 34 percent nationally from the peak in the first quarter of 2006 to the first quarter of 2011 -- or 40 percent in real terms -- and they still appear to be falling. The brief ''recovery'' in home prices of 2009 and 2010 was most likely spurred by federal housing stimulus measures like the home buyer tax credit. After that stimulus ended, prices resumed their downward trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the bubble, the sense of rising wealth and high expectations gave people a good reason to spend and a greater willingness to plunge into investment, too. Government policy makers breathed in the same optimism, which no doubt encouraged them to be lax on regulatory restraint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mood is far different now. Our latest survey, covering April and May of this year, included 296 home buyers, and their median expectation for annual home price appreciation over the next decade was down sharply, to just 3 percent. And, in comparison with the 2005 results, few people had extravagant expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 3 percent figure is well below prevailing rates for 30-year mortgages, now hovering between 4.5 and 5 percent. Amid such low expectations, buying a home with a mortgage certainly isn't being viewed as a way to get rich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even for people who have other reasons to buy a house, there may be little urgency to do so. Our 2011 survey found that the median expectation for home price appreciation next year is just 1 percent. So it won't be surprising if new home sales remain abysmally low and few jobs are created in the hard-hit construction industry. And it shouldn't be a shock if the personal savings rate stays at around 5 percent, as it has recently, up from around 1 percent in 2005. This would mean that consumer spending will not drive a strong recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A half-century ago, there was a lively discussion among economists about the dynamics of price expectations. For example, Alain C. Enthoven, then of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford wrote in 1956 that expectations that extrapolate past price increases can produce economic instability. But that thinking was largely cast aside in the 1960s, when my profession embraced the theory that efficient markets formed by people holding rational expectations could explain virtually all economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, economists in recent decades have not developed expectations theory much further. That needs to be corrected in coming years. In the meantime, this failing helps explain why the current crisis was generally unpredicted, and why its future course is so poorly understood.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifteen years ago, New York City's reputation as an international financial center was called into question when the giant Swiss bank <span class="companylink">UBS</span> moved its North American headquarters to the Connecticut suburbs, where it built the largest trading floor in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, though, <span class="companylink">UBS</span> is having buyer's remorse. It turns out that a suburban location has become a liability in recruiting the best and brightest young bankers, who want to live in Manhattan or Brooklyn, not in Stamford, Conn., which is about 35 miles northeast of Midtown. The firm has also discovered that it would be better to be closer to major clients in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, <span class="companylink">UBS</span> is seriously considering a reverse migration that would bring its investment banking division and up to 2,000 bankers and traders back to Wall Street and a new skyscraper at the rebuilt World Trade Center, according to real estate executives and city officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They just can't hire the bankers and traders they need,'' said one landlord who has spoken with <span class="companylink">UBS</span> but requested anonymity so as not to alienate a potential tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank is also looking at several Midtown locations, and Connecticut is sure to wage a fierce battle to keep <span class="companylink">UBS</span> in Stamford, where it is the largest private employer and the biggest taxpayer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A final decision is perhaps months away, and any move would not take place until 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over the last week, <span class="companylink">UBS</span> has engaged in negotiations with the developer Larry Silverstein over the terms of a potential financial deal at 3 World Trade Center, an 80-story office tower that he plans to build at 175 Greenwich Street. The return of <span class="companylink">UBS</span> would be a boon to New York, which in past decades often suffered from corporate defections that were fueled by a sense that computers and telecommunications had made a Manhattan location more of a luxury than a necessity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move would be the latest sign that New York has regained its allure as a caldron for the young and creative. Six months ago, <span class="companylink">Google</span> paid nearly $2 billion for a large building just north of the meatpacking district, in the same Manhattan neighborhood where many of its employees live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A key piece of the mayor's economic strategy has been to make New York City a place people want to be,'' Deputy Mayor Robert K. Steel said, ''and more than ever the city is the ideal location for any company, like <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, that succeeds by attracting a talented, motivated work force.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">UBS</span> trader in his 20s said that like many of his peers at the firm, he would have preferred a job in New York City, where he lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I mean, it's annoying,'' said the trader, who asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak about the possible relocation. ''I take Metro-North. I live pretty close to Grand Central, so it's not a terrible commute. But it's not ideal.'' The trip takes about 45 minutes to an hour, depending on how many stops the train makes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that ''the bank's plan is to move to New York, but it's mostly to be closer to clients.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">UBS</span> has hired the real estate brokerage firm <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> to explore new space. A <span class="companylink">UBS</span> deal would also be a vindication of a multibillion-dollar effort to rebuild the World Trade Center complex. After the terrorist attack on the trade center, there was widespread debate over the future of the city's financial center downtown. Since then, the residential population there has swelled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Conde Nast, publisher of Glamour, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, signed a deal to be the anchor tenant of 1 World Trade Center, the signature skyscraper at the northwest corner of the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein has the right to build three towers along Greenwich Street. The first one is already under construction, and the city has pledged to take space in it. But he has long sought a large financial tenant for what is known as Tower 3, which features five trading floors at the base, and will be built before Tower 2. A possible <span class="companylink">UBS</span> relocation, which was first reported by Bloomberg News last week, would be a major blow to Stamford, where a quarter of the office space is vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Michael Pavia of Stamford said <span class="companylink">UBS</span> executives had been noncommittal, saying they had ''no firm plans, nothing that they can report at this time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pavia said he and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a former Stamford mayor, were ''committed to keeping <span class="companylink">UBS</span> here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut's economic development commissioner, Catherine Smith, said: ''We just want to make sure that Connecticut has a fair shot. We love having them in the state and hope they'll stay. But you don't always win these competitive battles.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pavia said <span class="companylink">UBS</span> had about 3,000 employees in Stamford, down from more than 4,000 a couple of years ago. The bank, which leases but does not own any space in Stamford, is not expected to move all its employees out of town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">UBS</span> issued a statement saying that ''we routinely evaluate our space allocation as these leases expire and/or space becomes available.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In wooing <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, New York City landlords have tried to capitalize on Connecticut's recent decision to raise taxes to help balance the state budget, which has been criticized by some business groups. But it did not appear that <span class="companylink">UBS</span>'s interest in moving stemmed from the tax increases. The firm's review of its real estate needs began many months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">UBS</span> had already considered and rejected two Manhattan locations, 4 Times Square in Midtown and the World Financial Center downtown, before it started talks with Mr. Silverstein about the World Trade Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">UBS</span>, then known as Swiss Bank, touched off cross-border recriminations and municipal hand-wringing in 1994, when it announced plans to move from its two Manhattan locations, one in Midtown and the other in the financial district, to Stamford. City officials and real estate executives feared that New York was about to endure another wave of corporate departures to the suburbs. Some experts suggested that financial firms no longer needed to be in Manhattan and close to Wall Street because of the spectacular growth of computerized trading and telecommunications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut sweetened the pot for <span class="companylink">UBS</span> by dangling what was supposed to be a $120 million package of tax breaks and interest-free loans, although the actual value of the incentives turned out to be substantially less. The bank erected a trading floor the size of two football fields, packed with more than 5,000 computer monitors.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">When the Seller Is the Lender</span>
</div><div class="author">By MARYANN HAGGERTY   </div><div>689 words</div><div>5 June 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MORTGAGE underwriting is tight, and home sellers are anxious to unload properties into a stagnant market -- it sounds as if it could be time to consider seller financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such transactions remain rare, according to market participants, largely because of eroding home equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In seller financing, the owner of a property holds the mortgage for the buyer, usually for about five years, with a balloon payment after that. For individuals who don't need all the cash from a sale up front, the arrangement provides interest income, can delay or reduce capital-gains taxes, and gets a property off their hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the buyer without a bank loan, it makes a purchase possible. Such deals were popular in the 1980s when mortgage rates topped 17 percent. (In New York, there have been recent instances of developers' offering financing, especially in newer condominiums, but that's a different market dynamic.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because a seller who acts as a bank has to be able to clear his own mortgage without the buyer's cash, he needs equity -- that is, he needs to own most or all of the property. Falling home prices in recent years have cut equity dramatically, said Mike Litzner, the owner/broker of Century 21 American Homes, which has 12 offices on Long Island. In this market, ''the average seller lost 25 percent of equity from the peak of the market to today,'' he said. ''That loss of equity makes it harder for the average person to even consider financing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Century 21 recently released a survey of its franchisees and salespeople nationally; it found that 89 percent reported some customers' having difficulty obtaining loans in the last six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seller-financed deals do sometimes pop up, said Neil B. Garfinkel, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. His firm is handling a co-op purchase for a buyer whose mortgage from an institutional lender fell through. There was a quirk in the building's finances that meant it didn't meet underwriting standards. The seller stepped in, and it appears the deal will close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That situation, he said, underlines a question that both buyers and sellers should ask as they consider owner financing: Why won't the bank put up the money?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the buyer, that may mean weighing whether the discovery of an environmental problem cools ardor for a house, or whether a low appraisal signals that an offer merits renegotiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a seller who is in a position to provide financing, the biggest concern is whether the buyer is truly creditworthy. ''Presumably the seller does not want to end up with the property back,'' Mr. Garfinkel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep in mind that although such a transaction might seem less formal than bank financing, it shouldn't be treated that way, said Ilona Bray, a lawyer and the co-author of ''Selling Your House in a Tough Market,'' published by Nolo.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Get ready to really delve in and investigate'' the buyer's finances, she advises would-be sellers. Self-employed people are having a tough time getting mortgages now, even though they might otherwise be good risks. The seller should ask for several years of financial records, plus explanations for any less-than-perfect credit report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make sure deeds and other legal papers are filed according to local laws, Ms. Bray said, and ensure that documents lay out exactly how and when payments are due and what the penalties will be for late payments. ''This is the kind of relationship where people could feel it's casual,'' she said. It's not, and everyone involved must understand that defaults can lead to foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the buyer's perspective, she said, if you're considering such a deal, it's probably because you realize you might have trouble securing a conventional loan. If that's so, get your financial documents in order, and be prepared to ask sellers if they have flexibility. ''Everything's open to negotiation in the real estate world,'' she added.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WAS that Lady Gaga touring a penthouse at the Soho Mews in what looked like a bra and panties? Yes, it was. But, a broker joked, the apartment had too many windows and so she didn't buy there. Instead, it was Justin Timberlake who took the place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did the Bowery really seem more respectable just because John Legend bought a penthouse nearby on East Fourth Street?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Alex Rodriguez to Uma Thurman, celebrity house-hunting is tracked obsessively in this real-estate-obsessed city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there are few New Yorkers whose real estate adventures are as intensely chronicled as Sarah Jessica Parker's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it was rumored that Ms. Parker and her husband, Matthew Broderick, had decided to move to Brooklyn from Manhattan in 2009, it was viewed as a tectonic shifting of the cultural landscape. Although the buzz did not turn out to be true, after that, even the slightest hint of her interest in a property was tracked by dozens of real estate and entertainment Web sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last two years, the rumor mill has taken Ms. Parker from a $21 million penthouse on Central Park West to what is now believed to be her new town house in the East Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public may get hours of fun following the home-buying antics of boldface names, but the goal of many wealthy people, famous or infamous, is to get the deal done in private.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers describe signing confidentiality agreements, taking high-profile clients to tour properties in the middle of the night, and employing code language. And they say clients are increasingly using the cover of trusts or limited liability companies to buy Manhattan property anonymously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, when Jennifer Aniston -- whose search for a home in Manhattan was chronicled with the same intensity as every change in her hairstyle and relationship status -- reportedly settled on a West Village apartment last month, her name appeared nowhere on the paperwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But her dog's did. As was widely reported, the corgi-terrier mix (who has since died) lent his name to the Norman's Nest Trust, which purchased several apartments in a building on West 12th Street; Bruce Lagnese, Ms. Aniston's business manager, signed the documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many others who buy under the cover of investment vehicles are never found out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelly Kennedy Mack, the president of Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, said that of the 600 apartments in new development projects she had worked on last year, about 30 percent had been bought through trusts and LLCs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a number of reasons someone would want to buy an apartment this way,'' she said. ''One reason, obviously, is anonymity. But in other cases, it is for investment purposes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frances Katzen, a top broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, says her clients regularly ask about the possibility of buying a property through an investment vehicle. ''It is really de rigueur for high-end clients to at least explore the possibility,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is it just celebrities who want to keep quiet how much they are plunking down for an apartment. As the financial industry has come under public scorn for the role it played in the economic distress of recent years, Wall Street types are more eager than ever to keep their multimillion-dollar real estate deals away from prying eyes, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond concerns about perception and hopes for anonymity, buyers have personal reasons for choosing to keep their names out of a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most commonly, according to brokers and lawyers, clients are hoping to protect their assets from their spouses in case the marriage hits the rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luigi Rosabianca, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan who has helped set up property-buying vehicles, says that can be a dubious proposition, since divorce courts are like ''the Wild West'' and there is no guarantee that an LLC purchase can keep an apartment from being part of a settlement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, buying through an investment vehicle can help wealthy clients protect their assets in other ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you are Angelina Jolie and there is an accident or something at your apartment,'' he said, ''you are only liable for the value of the LLC,'' which is usually limited to the value of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, some people use investment vehicles to buy property for reasons that are not so aboveboard, like laundering or hiding money -- although lawyers said that had become more difficult since 9/11, when a crackdown made it easier for the authorities to track banking transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trusts, as opposed to LLCs, have other benefits, especially when it comes to estate planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For someone who set up a trust,'' Mr. Rosabianca said, ''there are usually two goals. One is to create a smooth transition to pass the property on to heirs or next of kin. It can also minimize your estate tax liability.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a major drawback that may make all but the wealthiest think twice before buying property through a vehicle: Many buyers who use a trust or an LLC are not eligible for a capital-gains tax exclusion. An individual who creates a trust or is the sole owner of an LLC may be eligible for an exclusion in some cases. (For individuals selling a property they bought under their own names, the cap on the exclusion is $250,000; for couples it is $500,000. That is very real money for most people.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, co-op boards present another obstacle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most credible co-op boards want a name on the deed,'' said Pamela Liebman, the president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the event of a problem, boards want to deal with a person, not an LLC. They also frown on the purchase of apartments for investment purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such resistance from co-op boards is one reason that new condominium developments and town houses are so appealing to high-end buyers, Ms. Mack said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once, co-op boards were seen as the guardians of privacy. They still are in a sense, since they play an active role in deciding who will be allowed to buy into their buildings. But real estate transactions have become more transparent in recent years; with the advent of searchable databases on the Internet, it is difficult to keep deals under the radar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken together with the shift in taste that now has downtown chic rivaling uptown prestige for big-money clients, Ms. Mack said, it has been a very good time for high-end new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, some buyers go to great lengths to conceal identity -- even if they ultimately fail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A high-profile financial service guy was buying an expensive place in a large, well-known building,'' Ms. Mack said, recalling a deal she worked on several years ago. ''We all had to sign confidentiality agreements. A code name was used throughout the process. The purchaser went through all this trouble and then listed his current address as the same address listed on the LLC.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cover blown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when celebrities do manage to keep the initial sale under wraps, it is only a matter of time before neighbors, doormen and others start noticing a famous face coming and going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even educated guesses can be wrong. When it was rumored that Ms. Parker bought the apartment in Brooklyn, the news was plastered on the cover of The New York Post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turned out not to be true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several more false reports surfaced before The New York Observer reported last month that Ms. Parker and Mr. Broderick had at last settled on a new home, paying $18.95 million for a 25-foot-wide Greek Revival town house built 165 years ago in the East Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property was bought under the cover of the Heirloom Trust, but the name of Ms. Parker's business manager, Frank Selvaggi, appeared on the paperwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all celebrities care about hiding their real estate adventures. Courtney Love was so consumed with finding the perfect downtown town house that she corresponded with the editors at Curbed NY, which was already chronicling her every move. After losing out on Milla Jovovich's Greenwich Avenue town house, she checked out three other town houses suggested by Curbed, tweeting dozens of messages.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who do want to remain anonymous often will not discuss the transaction even after it has been completed. When a reporter tried to get more information on the trust that Ms. Aniston reportedly used to buy her apartments, he was rebuffed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm sorry, but I don't see the upside to participating in this,'' said Stephen Huvane, Ms. Aniston's publicist. ''As you said, buying anything through a trust is mostly for privacy reasons, so this request negates that purpose.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to public records, Norman's Nest Trust paid $4.95 million for a West Village penthouse formerly owned by Sally Hershberger, a big-time hairstylist. The trust paid an additional $2 million for a one-bedroom apartment a floor lower.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about celebrities and others who shield their identities behind trusts and LLCs when buying real estate misstated the eligibility of such buyers for an exclusion from capital-gains tax when the property is sold. An individual who creates a trust or is the sole owner of an LLC may be eligible for an exclusion in some cases; it is not prohibited across the board.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How low can the market go?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For real estate, some economists say, an end to the seemingly endless decline in housing values might be in sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not immediately. At the moment, prices are still dropping. In 20 large cities, prices fell 0.8 percent in March from the previous month, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller Home Price Indexreleased Tuesday. That pushed the closely watched index below its level of two years ago to a new post-bubble low, and put it 33.1 percent under its July 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few analysts expect housing prices to rebound anytime soon. But quite a few are predicting that the market is close to the moment when things will stop getting worse, which will be a major improvement all by itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By far the bulk of the downturn of housing prices is beyond us,'' said Paul Dales of Capital Economics. He expects the market to slip 5 percent further, slightly more than he was expecting a few months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are some amazingly favorable signs. Housing is the most undervalued it's been in 35 years,'' Mr. Dales said. ''At some point, it's going to do very well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Muoio, senior principal of Maximus Advisors, says he thinks the market has already bottomed, although he expects it to bounce around in a narrow range for a few years rather than recovering. And James F. Smith, chief economist for the investment firm Parsec Financial and a rare housing bull, is predicting a 25 percent climb from here by mid-decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of pent-up demand for housing and someday it will be unleashed,'' Mr. Smith said, adding: ''Your guess is as good as mine when it will come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Case-Shiller data did not offer much room for short-term optimism. The national housing index, which is reported quarterly, fell 4.2 percent in the first quarter after a drop of 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010. This, too, is a new recession low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twelve of the 20 cities in the index hit a post-bubble low in March. Washington, D.C., was the only city where prices rose both in March and over the last year. In a double-digit drop that echoed the worst era of the crash, Minneapolis fell by 10 percent over the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Home prices continue on their downward spiral with no relief in sight,'' David M. Blitzer, the S.&amp; P. Index Committee chairman, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices are now back to where they were in mid-2002 even before taking inflation into account. Such a decline was unimaginable to the boosters and many of the analysts in the middle of the boom, who were fond of saying that house prices never fell on a national basis. But as credit dried up and the easy refinances disappeared, the foreclosures began. Prices fell sharply in late 2006, 2007 and 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market turned around in 2009, prompting hopes that the worst was over. A government tax credit proved wildly popular, but the declines resumed after its expiration a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists think there are still relatively large drops to come. Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, expects a 6 to 8 percent fall during the rest of the year. ''There are a lot of forces pushing prices downward,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of them is the excess number of houses. Builders built too much during the boom, and the mania for second and third homes has sharply diminished. New household formation will soak up the supply, but that will take years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial blog Calculated Risk estimated the excess housing supply this week using 2010 Census data, which it compared to 1990 and 2000. The blog concluded that the excess in April 2010 was about 1.8 million units, but probably several hundred thousand fewer now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wild card in all of this is consumer sentiment, otherwise known as confidence. The United States Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index unexpectedly fell to 60.8 in May from a revised 66 in April. Analysts had forecast a one-point rise, but the mood turned hesitant. The May level is the lowest since the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People without confidence in the economy and their own prospects tend to put off major purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are still scared,'' Douglas C. Yearley Jr., chief executive of the high-end builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, said in a recent interview. ''If they look in the paper and see that Robert Shiller says prices have another 20 percent to go, it has to keep them at home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shiller, one of the developers of the Case-Shiller index and a housing bear, did not respond to requests for his latest forecast, a development that no doubt made Mr. Yearley's day.</p>
