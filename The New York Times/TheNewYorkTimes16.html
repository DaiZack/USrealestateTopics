<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 11-story black-and-white building looks restrained on a corner between the irregular-grid tower that Jean Nouvel designed at 100 11th Avenue and the rippling facade that Audrey Matlock concocted for Chelsea Modern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed by Jared Della Valle and Andrew Bernheimer of Della Valle Bernheimer, a small but prestigious architecture firm in Dumbo, Brooklyn, the inverted peak building is a case study for architects in selling high design in a turbulent market. It is also the first venture in a new business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Materials, predominantly prefabricated, were chosen to support a construction schedule quick enough to calm a troubled lender and a pricing scheme that would appeal to buyers after the financial markets collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building, near the High Line, with loftlike full-floor apartments, is Mr. Della Valle's first foray as a developer, in partnership with Katherine McConvey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Della Valle and Ms. McConvey, a design client, bought the odd-sized parcel from Michael O'Neill for $5 million in 2006 with the intention of developing it together. By 2007, after a now-defunct lender called <span class="companylink">United Commercial Bank</span> gave the partners a $19 million mortgage for construction, Mr. Della Valle and Ms. McConvey decided to form Alloy Development (complete with duly bend-resistant business cards). Ms. McConvey is the chief executive, and Mr. Della Valle is the president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This site is 100 feet deep on the east side and 50 feet deep on the west,'' Mr. Della Valle said of its appeal as a residential lot in the fast-changing neighborhood. ''Because we have 50 feet in width, we can get 100 feet of glass in each apartment, where most full-floors in TriBeCa sit on a 25-foot lot with impediments to light and air.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Della Valle said that because he was a developer as well as an architect of the project, it was easier to keep construction costs under control. ''Our goal was to deliver a true three-bedroom, and we aimed to cost $50 per square foot less than everybody else on the block,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And because the architect and developer were on the same page, Mr. Della Valle said, they were able to make choices that both saved time and satisfied their aesthetic, like rectangular tubs that have no surrounding skirt. The built-in unity over design decisions helped shave four or five months from the development process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all that cohesion, the financial-market collapse in 2008 troubled the project's path. Two buyers broke their contracts after the financial crisis hit, Mr. Della Valle said, but the deals were resolved in the developer's favor. Today, Mr. Della Valle said, 7 of the building's 10 apartments have sold. Mr. Della Valle said buyers paid $2.48 million to $3.8 million, in line with asking prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've closed enough units that we're comfortable,'' he said. ''Our market position was never picky, because we knew Jean Nouvel was going to be here and we wanted to be less expensive than that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the appraiser Jonathan J. Miller, enterprising sorts like Mr. Della Valle and Ms. McConvey who bought West Chelsea land before the High Line arrived, got it cheaply enough that they should be able to profit from the area's new luster. Mr. Miller also said that buyers west of Eighth Avenue care more about living in a funky new neighborhood than about opulent amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the start, Alloy worked lean. For instance, Mr. Nouvel's outre design required that every window on his tower assume a unique shape. For 459 West 18th Street, a company in China made the windows, which were then fitted into panels by International Exterior Fabricators of Calverton, N.Y., to create the facades. The panels were delivered on a flatbed truck, and the prefabricated exterior went up in less than two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It cleared the Manhattan Bridge by an inch and a half,'' Mr. Della Valle said, laughing. ''They said they would never use panels this big again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alloy hopes to plant other stakes in a nascent far-west neighborhood. The firm controls three parcels from 10th to 11th Avenues and 35th to 36th Street, with an option for 22,500 more square feet fronting a planned park boulevard in the eventual Hudson Yards district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're actively seeking partners,'' Mr. Della Valle said. ''It's out of our bailiwick in terms of scale.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANY blocks in Midwood, with its rows of orderly detached homes and private driveways, give the feeling of a carefully planned suburb -- a serene surprise after turning off a thoroughfare like Coney Island Avenue or Ocean Parkway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But closer inspection reveals that the landscape has, in fact, been altered: on virtually every block, at least one or two homes have been significantly expanded -- built up, built out, even built down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The larger homes blend in as best they can with their smaller neighbors, but their oversized shadows are hard to miss: they are evidence of the wealth and the larger families that a thriving Orthodox Jewish population has brought to Midwood in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Midwood has always been Jewish, but it wasn't always Orthodox,'' said David Maryl, a broker at Jacob Gold Realty. ''Now for every family that's moving out, it's an Orthodox family moving in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn's Community Board 14, which covers the eastern half of Midwood, fields several home expansion requests each month from the area, said Alvin M. Berk, the board's chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the board first noted the steady trickle of requests about eight years ago and now handles about 30 a year. ''This seems to be a fairly high rate of building expansion,'' he said. ''But there's generally no opposition -- maybe just some concerns about a proposed enlargement reducing a neighbor's light and air.'' But applicants often make concessions to ease those concerns, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than building a larger home, Bill and Diana Spiegel bought one. They've moved about a mile east. ''We love the area,'' Mr. Spiegel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They walk more than a mile each way to attend the synagogue in their old area, because ''we have a little separation anxiety,'' he said. But on their way, they probably pass more than a dozen synagogues; they will probably switch to one nearby once the weather turns cold. ''It seems like there's a real sense of community here, and they welcome you,'' Mr. Spiegel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that Orthodox families first moved into Midwood about 25 years ago as they were priced out of Borough Park, a better established Orthodox neighborhood to the west. Nowadays, Midwood is ''very sought after, because people want to be near family and friends, a yeshiva or a synagogue affiliation,'' said Sora David, a broker with Eisberg Lenz Real Estate. Being within walking distance of a synagogue is critical for those who observe Orthodox Jewish laws forbidding driving and other activities on the Sabbath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are dozens of synagogues and many yeshivas scattered throughout Midwood. Some Hasidic synagogues, known as shtibls, are in single-family homes where the rabbi might live upstairs and the congregation might meet on the first floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Berk says synagogues are allowed as of right in any residential zone. But many of them have growing congregations that eventually require more space. He said that the community board had fielded and helped approve many applications for variances to turn houses into larger synagogues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midwood lies south of Flatbush and Brooklyn College, and north of Marine Park. Its eastern and western borders have expanded in recent years, pushing out to McDonald Avenue on the west and Flatbush Avenue on the east. ''As people have moved in, they've expanded the boundaries,'' said Raizy Brisman, the owner of Brisman Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between Nostrand and Flatbush Avenues, younger Orthodox families first moved into the East 30s about five years ago; prices were lower there than in the East 20s and East 10s, she said. That area used to be considered part of Flatbush or East Flatbush, she said, ''but it's all semantics. It's called Midwood now, because if you called it East Flatbush, the value for it would be less.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most homes sit on 40-by-100-foot lots and were built in the early part of the 20th century. The vast majority are detached single-family homes, but there are some two-families, as well as some semiattached and attached houses. There are also some rental and co-op buildings along parts of Avenue K and Ocean Parkway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers refer to an exclusive pocket between East Seventh and East Ninth Streets, running from Avenue I to Avenue K, as Midwood Manor. Many of its homes are on larger lots, and ''it's more manicured and very sought after,'' said Abraham Steinmetz, the owner of Steinmetz Real Estate. ''But there's very little available there. You're lucky to see one or two houses available in a year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhoods known as Midwood Park, West Midwood and South Midwood are all actually north of Midwood proper and were developed as parts of Victorian Flatbush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the recent building boom, developers tore down some single-family homes along Ocean Avenue and off Ocean Parkway and replaced them with six-unit condominiums. But brokers say that because the condos are primarily made up of one- and two-bedroom apartments, they do not appeal to large Orthodox families and have not sold well, although some units have sold to Russian immigrants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area is mostly residential, with a few commercial streets. Yeshivas and synagogues often blend right in -- in unassuming converted office buildings or on strictly residential streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that prices in Midwood have dropped 10 to 15 percent in the last year. Homes tend to sell by word of mouth, and at any given time, there are only about 40 homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An attached home on a busy street can sell for $400,000 to $500,000, but detached homes start at $600,000 and run over $2 million, depending on its size. Most houses in the East 20s, considered the oldest part of Midwood, are detached, with three to five bedrooms and private driveways, and sell for over $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The larger homes in Midwood Manor start at about $2 million and run above $5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along Ocean Parkway, one-bedroom co-ops sell for less then $200,000, two-bedrooms for about $250,000. On Ocean Avenue, one-bedroom condos sell for about $275,000, two-bedrooms $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Orthodox children attend local yeshivas. The Yeshiva of Flatbush is perhaps the best known, with classes from preschool through high school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Public School 193, on Avenue L, known as the Gil Hodges School, 86 percent of fifth-graders met state English standards in 2007-8, and 93 percent met math standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Intermediate School 240, on Nostrand Avenue, 58 percent of eighth graders met English standards, 71 percent met math standards, and 79 percent met science standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward R. Murrow High School, on Avenue L, emphasizes a college preparatory curriculum and has selective music, art and theater programs for which students must audition. SAT averages there last year were 476 in reading, 507 in math and 481 in writing, versus 435, 459 and 432 citywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midwood High School is north of Midwood, opposite Brooklyn College.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midwood's appeal is its quiet residential quality. On school days, yellow buses fill the streets, ferrying children to and from their different yeshivas. Traffic along the shopping strips on Avenues J and M can be downright dangerous, as drivers double-park to get their shopping done. But the streets grow quiet at sundown on Friday, with the start of the Sabbath, and most stores stay shuttered until Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avenue J's commercial strip, between Coney Island Avenue and East 16th Street, is filled with kosher restaurants, delis and bakeries. Di Fara Pizza, at East 15th Street, harks back to Midwood's more Italian past. It's known for its $5 slice, handmade with imported ingredients by the pizzeria's septuagenarian founder, Domenico DeMarco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avenue M's shops run from Ocean Avenue to Ocean Parkway. In addition to kosher pizzerias and kosher and Russian supermarkets, the street has discount stores and chains like Godiva.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coney Island Avenue, a much wider thoroughfare, has a range from auto repair shops and carwashes to ladies' wig shops, Judaica stores and kosher restaurants. Among these are Schnitzi, a schnitzel bar; and Carlos and Gabby's, a Mexican grill. Food bloggers compare Pomegranate, a gleaming new kosher supermarket, to Whole Foods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Q and B lines, both of them express, bisect Midwood along East 16th Street, providing a relatively easy 40-minute commute to Midtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F train, which makes many more stops, runs along the western edge of Midwood on McDonald Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Settled in the mid-1600s, the area was forested and got its name from the Dutch for ''middle woods.'' Subways arrived in the early 1900s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Famous residents include Woody Allen, who graduated from Midwood High School; Marisa Tomei, a Murrow High graduate; and Gil Hodges, a first baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1950s and a manager of the Mets.</p>

</div><div class="author">By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD   </div><div>1613 words</div><div>5 December 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So you're looking to buy a new home, and you think a foreclosed house may be the best deal. You've probably noticed, then, that many of the big banks' Web sites are beginning to look a bit like real estate brokerages, showcasing the many properties that they've repossessed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These houses often sell for about 15 to 20 percent less than comparable homes in the same neighborhood, according to the National Association of Realtors. And while the banks have been careful not to flood the market with all their properties at once, there are hundreds of thousands of listings now, and half a million more expected in the coming year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the seemingly high inventory, though, anyone considering buying a distressed property should heed the classic warning: Caveat emptor, or let the buyer beware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closing a deal in a desirable neighborhood can be hard to do. Many aspiring homeowners have lost out to all-cash bidders. Buyers also need to search more aggressively than usual, which means figuring out which brokers have the best foreclosure listings, religiously checking for new ones and visiting the properties shortly thereafter. Buyers also need to ensure that the home is truly a good deal and not a money pit -- most of these homes are sold as is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, as Rick Sharga, senior vice president of RealtyTrac, a foreclosure listing service, put it, ''The best discounts have been on bank-owned property.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are still interested in buying a distressed property, you have several options. You can buy it through a preforeclosure sale, at a public auction or through a bank or other entity that has taken ownership of the home -- these properties are known as real estate owned, or R.E.O.'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Below is a more detailed description of the potential risks and benefits of buying R.E.O.'s and preforeclosure transactions known as short sales, where the bank agrees to sell a home for less than is owed on the mortgage. Through October, foreclosures and short sales accounted for nearly 37 percent of all home sales, on average, according to the Realtors' association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">R.E.O.'s</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditional homebuyers are generally discouraged from buying homes at auction because there are too many risks -- you can't tour the inside of the home, which increases your chances of buying a house that will drain your bank account. Equally important, the home won't necessarily have a clear title, which means there may be tax liens or other debts against the property. And when you buy the home, you buy those issues, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the benefits of R.E.O.'s is that the bank typically clears any title issues before it puts the house on the market. ''It's easiest because there is a price already, there is access, you can do your estimate for repairs, and you can write your offer and go,'' said Alexis McGee, president of Foreclosures.com, which lists foreclosures and offers classes for foreclosure investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But you need to do your share of preparatory work. Start by getting acquainted with the listings in your target area. All R.E.O.'s are sold through an agent. You can find their listings directly on the big banks' Web sites, like <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, as well as regional banks like SunTrust. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> offers its listings through the HomePath Web site and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> through HomeSteps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can also find free listings through independent brokerages like Redfin.com, which has a forum where you can compare notes with other buyers. If you pay a monthly fee, you can access sites that track distressed homes from the moment of default through foreclosure. These sites include RealtyTrac ($49.95 a month), Foreclosures.com ($49.95), and Foreclosure.com ($39.80), all of which provide a free weeklong trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of your first steps would be getting preapproved by a mortgage lender so that once you find a property you are interested in, you can move quickly. Call the listing agent, or hire a buyer's agent to do it for you. (You should hire a buyer's agent with experience in these types of sales anyway. In some states, the listing agents may refer you to someone else in their office to represent your interests, said Frank Verna, an R.E.O. broker in Jupiter, Fla.). Arrange to see the home as soon as possible. The bank selling the property may want you to be preapproved with their own lending arm, though you can always use another lender in the end, experts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most R.E.O.'s are sold as is, so buyers should make their offers contingent on a home inspection. It's best to find inspectors who are also licensed contractors (with references), so they can estimate repair costs. Putting too many contingencies in your offer, however, is likely to derail your bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers also need to be prepared to lose to buyers with all cash. That's what happened to Jason and Elise Hope, who have been searching for a small starter home in San Diego County for six months. The couple has made more than two dozen offers on bank-owned properties, and a couple of short sales, priced from $300,000 to $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the most part, we never heard back from the listing agent,'' said Mr. Hope, 28, who works as an equity research associate for a forensic accounting firm. ''When we did hear back, we often heard the same story -- that the listing had 10 to 20 offers on it, along with ours, within the first weekend of it being available for showing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Verna, the broker, explained: ''In the R.E.O. world, cash is still king because there is no appraisal, last-minute quality checks or potential problems to kill the deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may be able to increase your chances by making your best offer from the start. But to ensure you don't overpay, research comparable sales on sites like Zillow.com or have your agent prepare a ''comparative market analysis'' for you. ''You are negotiating with a calculator, and if the numbers don't work for the seller, they just say no and move on,'' Mr. Verna said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> does give prospective homebuyers a leg up. Last month, it introduced a program that shuts out investor buyers for the first 15 days a home is on the market. Moreover, Fannie also has a financing program, which allows buyers to put down as little as 3 percent and doesn't require them to carry mortgage insurance. It also provides loans that allow borrowers to wrap in costs for home renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie is testing a program that also initially shuts out investor buyers, and it is currently offering consumers who buy one of its properties up to 3.5 percent of a home's purchase price, which can be used for closing costs, moving or even furnishings. The program was recently extended to buyers who submit a purchase offer by Jan. 31 and close by March 26. Primary homebuyers are also eligible for a two-year warranty on certain home repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short Sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales tend to be more problematic than R.E.O.'s. If you make an offer on an R.E.O., you can expect to get a response within a few days. With a short sale, experts say, it can take months. You also can't necessarily trust the listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It may easily be a teaser price just to get offers in,'' said Carolyn Warren, author of a new book ''Homebuyers Beware: Who's Ripping You Off Now?'' (FT Press). ''It's kind of like posting something on <span class="companylink">eBay</span>. They are going to list it at a dollar, but they might only sell it for $1,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other potential problems as well. While the seller may be motivated, the bank has to be convinced of two things: ''One is that the homeowner in question deserves a hardship exception,'' Mr. Sharga of RealtyTrac said. ''The second thing is that you have to convince it that it is market value, even though it is below the mortgage amount.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complicating matters further, the homeowner may have more than one loan on the property, adding to the number of parties involved in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this lengthens the time to close a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can get lucky, too. Michelle and Mark Gordon are happily living in a three-bedroom ranch that they bought through a short sale in San Juan Capistrano, Calif., in February. It took only three months to close -- record time in the world of short sales. But Mrs. Gordon, a librarian who now stays home with her young daughter, did her homework and was aggressive in her search. She checked the listings religiously on Redfin.com, and saw the property the day after she found it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gordons paid $500,000 for the home, and the bank paid the $12,000 in closing costs. The property was recently valued at $537,500 on Zillow.com. ''We painted two rooms,'' Mrs. Gordon said. ''That was it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHICAGO -- It took nearly two decades to get to this day, but on Nov. 20, Block 37, a five-level mall in the heart of this city's downtown, got the green light to open its public areas. However, the developer, Joseph Freed &amp; Associates, was not celebrating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That afternoon -- in what real estate specialists say was an extraordinary event for a mall on the verge of welcoming its first shoppers -- a judge named a receiver from <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, the real estate services giant, to take control of this 285,000-square-foot project away from Freed, which is based here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The request for a receiver came from <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, the lead lender in the $205 million construction loan. In October, the bank sued to foreclose, saying the developer lacked the funds to complete the mall. Situated on State Street, between Randolph and Washington Streets, the glassy new mall stands opposite the former Marshall Field flagship store, now a <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developing Block 37, named for the site's designation as one of Chicago's original blocks, has long been a priority for Mayor Richard M. Daley, whose office faces the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning in 1989, several older buildings were demolished to make room for a mixed-use development with an underground walkway linking two subway lines. Successive developers failed to make their projects work, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, the owner at the time, the struggling Mills Corporation, sold the retail portion of the site to Freed and the office portion to <span class="companylink">Golub &amp; Company</span>, a local firm, and its financial partner, BlackRock, an investment firm in New York. Last year, Golub completed a 16-story office building overlooking Daley Plaza. It is anchored by CBS and Morningstar, the financial services company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other developers trying to complete projects in the worst recession in decades, Freed has experienced defections by retailers. Yet by the time the foreclosure lawsuit was filed, more than 70 percent of the space was spoken for -- either through signed leases or commitments, said Laurance H. Freed, the president of the family-owned business. A Steve Madden shoe store opened the Saturday before Thanksgiving. A few other stores, including the athletic apparel retailer Puma, followed on the Friday after Thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Freed said he had been working with the bank to modify the loan when he was surprised with the suit. ''To us it seems suspicious that a month before you're opening for the bank to do this,'' Mr. Freed said in an interview in the former Carson Pirie Scott department store on State Street, which he is redeveloping. ''We felt very good about what we were doing, but they lost confidence in us.'' The company said it had invested $20 million in the project and assigned 20 professionals to work on it full time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Shirley Norton, a bank spokeswoman, said Freed had been in default since ''at least'' March 2008. ''We have been in negotiations with the developer since March 2009, but cost overruns have continued to rise,'' she said in an e-mail message. ''The banks believe that the appointment of a receiver is the right step to ensure that construction and management continue uninterrupted.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank's foreclosure suit also caught city officials off guard, said Steven J. Holler, a deputy corporation counsel. Based on ''competence and capacity,'' Mr. Holler told Judge Margaret Ann Brennan of Cook County Circuit Court, ''Freed is better positioned to finish this project than CBRE.'' <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> said it could not comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a telephone interview, Mr. Holler said: ''Our view is that Freed has done about as good a job as you can do in this economy, but that ultimately the project is dependent on funding from <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, so we took a neutral position on the receivership.'' Mr. Holler said $71.9 million was needed to complete the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In court papers, Freed said that it had not actually missed any loan payments. The developer did acknowledge two defaults but characterized them as insignificant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One default took place when Freed failed to invest more equity to correct what the bank says is now a $41.6 million loan imbalance, resulting from cost overruns. A second default occurred when Freed did not maintain the required $5 million in unencumbered funds. Before filing its suit, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> unsuccessfully tried to persuade Freed to repay the $135 million it has received so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Freed attributed the cost overruns and delays to the state of the economy; enhancements to Mills's design, including expanded elevators and a larger sky-lighted atrium; and inconsistent actions by the bank. Muvico, a movie theater chain, had agreed to open a theater on the fourth floor, but when it ran into financial trouble and sought to modify the terms, the bank did not go along, according to court papers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the city has imposed a number of conditions, including a requirement for a mix of local and national tenants, Mr. Freed said these had no bearing on the delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Nov. 20 hearing, John H. Anderson, a lawyer for the bank, told the judge that the settlement talks had failed. Freed ''simply doesn't have the cash to make this project a go,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Lynch, one of Freed's lawyers, said his client was seeking additional sources of equity. ''He's been a couple of hundreds of thousand dollars short at various times,'' Mr. Lynch acknowledged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For technical reasons, the receiver is not yet in charge of the mall but is expected to take over soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change will inevitably cause more delays, said David Stone, president of Stone Real Estate, a Chicago company that specializes in urban retail real estate. ''It's going to take any leasing agent time to get up to speed,'' he said. ''If there's something retailers like, it's consistency and predictability.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than money is at stake in this dispute, said Mr. Freed, who plans to appeal the receivership order. ''We've had a group dedicated to this project, with a lot of rightful pride,'' he said. ''It's been 20 years in the making. There's a lot of emotion invested in this site.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SETTING: This corner unit is one of 13 apartments in a former church converted to residences around three years ago. The building is in Ukrainian Village, originally named for the influx of East European and German immigrants who arrived, in part, from other Chicago neighborhoods after the Great Fire in 1871.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past decade, the area -- and neighboring ones like Wicker Park and Bucktown -- have started to gentrify, with small restaurants, coffee shops and boutiques moving into the low-lying brick buildings along thoroughfares like Division Street, about a 10-minute walk north. Chicago Avenue, a few blocks south, is still home to businesses like the Ukrainian Cultural Center and Sak's Ukrainian Village Restaurant &amp; Lounge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CTA, the city's elevated train line, is a little over a mile away, but there's a bus stop nearby on Western Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INSIDE: The great room is divided into living and dining areas, and has original hardwood floors and brick walls. Off the great room is a kitchen, and off the kitchen is a small balcony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downstairs are the apartment's three bedrooms, each with closet space. One is currently used as a dressing room.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Dec. 2 about Shaya Boymelgreen, a star of the New York real estate boom who has fallen on hard times, misstated part of the address of one of his apartment projects, in Brooklyn's Dumbo neighborhood. It is at 42 Main Street, not 402. A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail message this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Jan 08 2010 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the real estate boom, few new developers filled the city with luxury condominiums as fast as Shaya Boymelgreen. He turned Wall Street corner offices into minimalist bachelor lairs, built TriBeCa apartments snapped up by celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and crowded the edges of Park Slope, Brooklyn, with condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Boymelgreen, 58, has since retreated mightily from the limelight as his fortune has reversed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is battling a bankruptcy filing against one of his companies, eviction from his Brooklyn headquarters -- a judge ruled Tuesday morning that the proceedings could move forward early next year -- and the seizure of a Queens theater in what the buyer calls a ''friendly foreclosure.'' Condo owners are filing lawsuits over his construction. He has cut his staff to 15 from 200, his spokeswoman says, and several former co-workers report that the five of his eight children who are in the family business are looking for other employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boymelgreen arrived in New York City from Israel in 1969 and worked in asbestos removal before getting involved in small development projects. His break came in 2001, when he met the diamond magnate Lev Leviev on a cruise, and the two became business partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boymelgreen went on to build more than 2,400 apartments in New York City and expanded his real estate empire into more than a dozen countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As his star rose in the real estate world, so did his public profile. Mr. Boymelgreen regularly appeared at construction sites with his hulking driver, entertained employees at his lakefront compound upstate and hosted real estate executives at a martini-infused private concert by John Legend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This guy was headed to be the next Robert Moses,'' said Howard L. Zimmerman, an architect whose firm was hired by residents of three of Mr. Boymelgreen's Brooklyn buildings to address construction problems. ''He just flamed out. I don't think he had the infrastructure to sustain the growth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his part, Mr. Boymelgreen has said little and has kept his message upbeat. ''We're dealing with the problems we have as serious and worthy of our full attention,'' he said in a statement. ''Setbacks are difficult and regrettable, but when you lose your confidence you've lost all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sara Mirski, managing director of development for Mr. Boymelgreen, maintains that he will develop the Queens theater site along with properties on West 23rd Street, upstate and in Texas. He is just waiting for ''when financing is available,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the developer Sam Suzuki said that his lawyers were drafting a contract to buy the theater property's mortgage from the bank, that he was doing due diligence on the property and that he planned to close early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a recent condo project at 20 Pine Street, in the financial district, remains entangled in a dispute with Mr. Leviev's company, Africa Israel USA, over construction responsibilities, said Richard A. Marin, the company's chief executive. Relations between Mr. Boymelgreen and Mr. Leviev have been sour since a split in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LibertyPointe Bank, which Mr. Boymelgreen founded in 2005, received a cease and desist notice from the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> in July, ordering it to halt some of its business, like commercial real estate loans. The bank's president, Merton Corn, said it was working to collect on the troubled loans and had not been making any new ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the F.D.I.C. gave the bank 30 days to raise cash. Mr. Corn said that he hoped to raise the necessary capital and that he had ''a couple of prospects.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boymelgreen is also facing criticism from residents of earlier projects. Gus Sheha of 402 Main Street, a 20-unit Boymelgreen building in Brooklyn's Dumbo neighborhood, said residents have spent $250,000 on repairs since 2003 -- including work to connect the building's waste line to the city's so that sewage would stop flowing into the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sheha said that in 2005 Mr. Boymelgreen offered the building's residents a $250,000 settlement if they agreed to sign a waiver releasing him from liability for any new problems; they turned him down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mirski, the spokeswoman for Mr. Boymelgreen, would not comment on any settlement at 402 Main Street, but said that lately many condo boards had been seeking settlements, which she attributed to ''a reduction in common charge income resulting from foreclosures or delayed or nonpayment by residents.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents of the 173-unit Newswalk building, a former Daily News printing plant in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, that Mr. Boymelgreen finished converting into condos in 2002, have spent $5 million in repairs and legal fees to address structural problems, said Michael Rogers, a member of Newswalk's condo board. He said the building had so many leaks that some of its original concrete beams had started to fall apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This was a really solid building,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''The construction is so poor. It's construction that could have hurt people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boymelgreen's handling of criticism did not help, residents and lawyers said. While many developers have had similar problems in new buildings, Mr. Zimmerman said, Mr. Boymelgreen stood out because he fought accepting responsibility for repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Zimmerman met with Mr. Boymelgreen and his staff about the problems in three Brooklyn buildings, he said, the developer repeatedly argued, ''What do they expect -- a Manhattan building?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mirski disputed that account and said, ''Codes and professional standards of workmanship are the same in any borough or locale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the convoluted eviction battle: Henry Weinstein, who owns a Prospect Heights building that Mr. Boymelgreen leases, and where he has his office, sued Mr. Boymelgreen in 2003 for selling the lease on the building to Forest City Ratner, the developer of the Atlantic Yards project. The office is located within the Atlantic Yards site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But hours before Mr. Weinstein was to evict Mr. Boymelgreen, Henry Herbst -- whose company installed telecommunication systems in Mr. Boymelgreen's projects and who also had his offices in the building -- filed bankruptcy proceedings against Mr. Boymelgreen, according to public records and interviews with Mr. Herbst and Mr. Weinstein's lawyer, David Brody. Mr. Herbst said he feared losing his office and the offices he sublet to others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He refused to go into bankruptcy,'' Mr. Herbst said. ''So we put him into bankruptcy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boymelgreen's defenders pointed out that most people in the real estate industry are struggling. Eric Kogan, a contractor on several projects, said that he ''feels so bad'' that his former boss is in trouble. ''Look at me,'' he said, working the cash register at a Subway sandwich franchise he bought on West 41st Street. ''I used to do sky rises. Now look at what I'm doing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former co-workers say Mr. Boymelgreen should be judged by his achievements. Edan Shiboleth, who was his director of finance and investment, said his former boss has not forgotten his roots. During the boom, he remained in the semidetached brick home in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where he raised his family, he said. He expects Mr. Boymelgreen will be fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Like a Trump, like a Macklowe, they continue to keep growing,'' Mr. Shiboleth said. ''They don't stop, ever.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ    </div><div>627 words</div><div>2 December 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.    </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes with sales pending reached its highest level in three years in October, as Americans took advantage of a government-financed credit for first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that its pending home sales index rose 3.7 percent in October, the ninth month of gains and a 32 percent increase over the previous year, when the economy was reeling from the financial crisis. Analysts had predicted a 1 percent decline in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said manufacturing expanded at a slower rate than expected in November, reinforcing the notion that a pickup in United States factory activity would be tentative as the economy recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a third report from the Commerce Department said construction spending was flat in October at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $910.77 billion. Analysts had predicted a decrease, but a rise in residential spending helped offset losses in commercial spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relatively sunny reports brought optimism to investors and suggested that the economy in three crucial sectors -- housing, manufacturing and construction -- was on track to a steady, albeit slow, recovery. But economists warned that those sectors could suffer further setbacks as governments gradually reduced stimulus efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, economists said, the housing market still faced significant challenges. They attributed the large gains in October to consumers rushing to take advantage of a government credit of up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers before it expired at the end of November. Now that the credit has been extended through April, analysts expect next month's data on home sales will not register nearly as much growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight, played down the relevance of the gains in pending home sales, which took the index to its highest level since March 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What the credit did was distort the data by shifting sales from one period to another,'' he said. ''Fundamentally, the housing market still has a lot of problems, and I don't think we'll see sales start picking up on a sustained basis until late next year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity in November fell to 53.6 from 55.7 in October, short of the forecast of 55. A reading above 50 signals expansion. The report showed signs of future growth, as new orders increased in November. Inventories continued to decrease, but production was less robust than in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revival of manufacturing is considered crucial to pulling the economy out of a steep downturn. Cliff Waldman, an economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, said the report suggested factory output would grow at a slower rate after increasing rapidly in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The clear turn in the U.S. and global economies has pulled manufacturing out of a deep slump,'' he said. ''But a deleveraging U.S. consumer and an uneven global economic recovery will make it difficult for U.S. factory output to grow at the rate that is needed to absorb historic excess capacity anytime soon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts had expected construction spending to fall slightly in October. It held steady in part because the government had revised its September data and recorded a 1.6 percent decrease in spending rather than a 0.8 percent increase. Excluding residential improvements, which are difficult to estimate, spending fell 1.1 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARY COLE lives in an old wood-frame house, all yellow paint and green trim. It has a peaked roof with a tall chimney. Set back from the street on a small hill, her home feels private and peaceful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It resonates of the past -- books you've read, movies you've seen,'' Ms. Cole said. ''This house looks like a children's drawing of a house. It's a very classic house like that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A classic, to be sure. Except that Ms. Cole does not live in the hills of Massachusetts. She lives in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, just a few short blocks from the G train.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Yorkers are used to the strange and unexpected. (A cowboy in skivvies singing in Times Square? BOR-ring!) But that which is predictable elsewhere (Lawns! Driveways!) can be a shock here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are neighborhoods in the boroughs outside of Manhattan that seem downright suburban, and in those places, a pitched roof is nothing special. But in Midtown Manhattan or brownstone Brooklyn, a house that looks as if it fell out of the Connecticut sky is a bit of a surprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They feel like country houses,'' said Sherida Paulsen, the president of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects. ''They're wonderful reminders of what was here before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the city has changed quite a bit since these houses were built, they do not just look different from the outside, but to the people who live in them, they feel different on the inside as well. If the original owners enjoyed an unexceptional house with proximity to a cow, the current occupants are pleased by an exceptional house with easy access to 2 percent milk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Delgado lives in a clapboard house in Clinton Hill that first appeared on a map in 1855. ''Living in a house like this, it gives me the best of both worlds,'' he said. ''It allows me to have a family not in an apartment but a house, and still have all the conveniences that I can walk to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This house -- close to public transportation and a block from the Brooklyn Queens Expressway -- has a wide wooden porch shaded by tall, delicate trees. From the look of it, it might be on a postcard of old New Orleans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Delgado, his wife, Justine Fasciano, and their year-old son, Quentin, live on the top floor in a two-bedroom apartment with ancient floor beams and a pitched ceiling, seemingly a world away from the crush of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Delgado says that the people who are the most surprised by his home -- as well as the large carriage house and yard out back -- are longtime city dwellers who are accustomed to thinking in terms of brick and brownstone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They say, 'Wow, I didn't know this was back here!' '' Mr. Delgado said, standing in the backyard. ''You don't feel like you're in Brooklyn when you come back here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 1938 and 1943, the city took hundreds of thousands of photographs of houses and buildings throughout the five boroughs for tax purposes. The picture of Mr. Delgado's house shows another wood-frame house that has since become kindling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time was, of course, when wood was the norm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Andrew S. Dolkart, the director of Columbia University's historic preservation program, many wooden houses were put up by developers to create suburbs. In Fort Greene, for example, developers built houses in groups in the 1840s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was never a developer-driven thing in Manhattan,'' Mr. Dolkart said. The few wooden houses still standing there, he explained are ''from a semirural period. They just survived serendipitously.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In tightly packed Manhattan, he said, shingles and wooden porches gave way to the need to reduce the risk of fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Laws would be passed to ban wooden construction up to a certain street in Manhattan, and then it would be pushed farther north,'' Mr. Dolkart said. ''By the time development moved into most neighborhoods, wooden construction had been banned.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, building a house of wood is illegal in many parts of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the few wooden houses remaining in Manhattan is on the market. It is one of a pair built side by side in 1866, the same year the wood-frame ban was extended to the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of these houses, on 53rd Street between First and Second Avenues, has a little brick at the base and then clapboard siding rising to a mansard roof. The small curved windows on the top floor look as if they belonged on a dollhouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report written by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2000 for one of the houses, 314 East 53rd Street, describes the buildings as a good example of what once could be found throughout Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, that house is listed for $3.54 million. It's a friendly yellow building in the middle of urban roar and buzz. Approximately 2,500 square feet, it has four stories, three bedrooms and a 900-square-foot backyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looks like it could be in Connecticut, doesn't it?'' said Karin Posvar-Picket, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> and the listing agent on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it is distinct from its brownstone and high-rise neighbors, Ms. Posvar-Picket doesn't think it will be the clapboard style or the country kitchen that sells the place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the person who's going to buy this is a person who wants a backyard and doesn't want to have to deal with a condo or co-op board,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roslyn B. Huebener, a principal broker at the Aguayo &amp; Huebener Realty Group in Brooklyn, says that while the pool of people interested in living in a clapboard house is small, its members are a passionate bunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wood frames are not for everyone,'' Ms. Huebener said. ''But most people who want wood frame will do whatever they can to get them. There's that cult of wood-frame buyers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Ms. Huebener, while brownstones often sell for higher prices than wooden houses, brownstones also tend to be much larger. Wood frames can command more per square foot, she said, because they are in such short supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these old houses are often in need of repair, so there are deals to be found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Huebener just sold a wooden house on the corner of Adelphi Street and Lafayette Avenue in Fort Greene. Built around 1840, it is in rough shape and needs work inside and out, but was priced to sell by an extremely motivated seller -- an estate. The three-story house was listed at $795,000. Ms. Huebener said that she had 11 offers in about 10 days, and that five were above the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone who came through lost their hearts,'' Ms. Huebener said. ''It is an oasis from the hard surfaces of the city. Brownstones are gorgeous, elegant. However, there is something soft and restorative about a wood-frame house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer, Maeve Bace, can't wait to move in. And she doesn't ever want to leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I really imagine living there until the end of my life,'' said Ms. Bace, a first-time homeowner. ''It's a home where you can have a family -- a big family even.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the wood-frame houses left in brownstone Brooklyn, a few have space available for rent. Often, those ''country'' rentals command a higher monthly price than their row house neighbors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because of their uniqueness, even if it's a smaller floor-through, you'll get it rented faster,'' Ms. Huebener said. ''In brownstones, you'll see a floor-through and another floor-through and then another.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For DK Holland, the open spaces inside her house in Fort Greene, which she believes was once used to store tack for horses, are the most important thing. But visitors, she said, generally direct their compliments at the facade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her tiny house is a two-story white-painted brick structure with a finished basement that she uses as an office. The front door opens onto a narrow wooden porch. There is also has a side garden, ringed by a tall wooden fence, with a gate that leads directly to the sidewalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people might not like that,'' Ms. Holland said, ''but I really want openness.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the house is brick, it lacks the high fortresslike facade of many a brownstone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People can look in my windows,'' she said. ''And sometimes they do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out that country living in the city can be a very public affair: if passers-by are curious, they're not shy. And the first-floor windows in these houses are often at eye level from the sidewalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In New York, people just put themselves right in front and have absolutely no qualms about it,'' said Alain Goldrach, whose gray mid-19th-century wooden house on the Upper East Side of Manhattan is a magnet for Nosy Parkers. ''You don't have the same kind of privacy as if you lived in the country surrounded by a large garden and some woods.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goldrach and his wife, Anne, enjoy the history of their home, they say, and relish the garden out back, complete with a little pond and brightly colored fish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But from their living room, near Lexington Avenue, one does not hear bird song. One hears construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When people visit them for the first time, however, the shock of the country house in the city drowns out the neighborhood's honking taxis and pounding jackhammers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I feel like I'm in the country!'' Ms. Goldrach exclaimed, channeling their guests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're not,'' her husband said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So close,'' she added. ''Yet so far.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW do you sell sumptuous condominiums on a ho-hum block in a skittish residential market? For Michael Namer, a veteran downtown developer, the answer at 311 East 11th Street is one word: calm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Air filters whisper. Heat for bathrooms comes from panels in the floor. Windows block noise and repel heat. And massages will be available on the ground floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Namer said he already held signed contracts for 12 of 36 units at the midblock condominium, near Second Avenue, scheduled to finish construction in March. Prices range from $871,000, for a one-bedroom, to $2 million for a penthouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Namer and his brother Izak bought the site, a garage, for $16 million in 2007. Mr. Namer said they were determined to erect an ''eco-indulgent'' building from the start. Called by the somewhat unwieldy name of 311 E 11: Village Green, its eco-features include a green roof. The architect is Stephen B. Jacobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the economy cratered, though, the green roof took a back seat, and the tranquillity and energy efficiency that had also informed Mr. Namer's concept became the stronger selling points. ''It's about being clean,'' he said. ''It's not only about the environment, but about how we want to live.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, heat pumps in each apartment substitute for a boiler, exchanging hot air for cold to counter the air outside. They also run more quietly than standard radiators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Windowpanes sit in enclosures called gaskets, Mr. Namer said, ''so that the outside metal never touches the inside metal.'' This enables the windows to retain heat more effectively in winter and keeps out sunlight in summer, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emphasizing the building's overall balm, Mr. Namer said, meant investing special attention in the ground-floor common area. The three-faceted ''wellness center'' has a nearly 700-square-foot gym with a soothing ''water wall,'' a lounge that could host yoga classes and massages, and a coffee bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Namer said membership in the center should cost residents less than $50 a month. He envisions a ''wellness concierge'' to schedule fitness training and de-stressing sessions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers of the first-floor duplexes will have access to a back garden designed in keeping with Mr. Namer's ecological and psychological aims. Like the building's green roof, which is planted with succulents, the garden should shelter the building from excessive sun and heat. Mr. Namer said the garden would take longer to complete than the units because he insisted on walls made of wood certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside the units, he takes a similar approach to appliances. Mr. Namer described a 30-inch refrigerator from Liebherr as ''fully recyclable'' at the end of its life, and a Washlet toilet with a 1.2-gallon tank as a source of water savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices average around $700 a square foot, except for the penthouse triplex, which has roughly 2,000 square feet of outdoor space and is listed for about $900 a square foot. Mr. Namer described prospective buyers as young couples and people whose parents are helping them buy a first apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This makes sense,'' he said, ''because people who are not new to the market are trying to sell their own apartments, or they are not moving.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This market may also appreciate Mr. Namer's promise to give away free compact fluorescent light bulbs to all occupants, indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Namer calls 311 E 11: Village Green a case for ecologically smart buildings that appeal to first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It cost roughly $15 million to develop, around 5 percent over budget, he said, but he has no regrets about pressing ahead in an uncertain market. ''I'm building a template,'' he said. ''I'm not building a monument.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIRST-RATE paintings, photos and films offer plenty of reasons to duck inside the nine cultural institutions lining Museum Mile, a narrow slice of Upper Manhattan fronting Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on a warm Sunday afternoon, judging from the crowd near the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it seemed as if most residents of and visitors to the area, which cuts through Carnegie Hill and East Harlem, were outside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Couples hauled shopping bags, two to a hand, past dozens of tables heaped with art-themed bric-a-brac, like Van Gogh self-portraits modified as magnets. Wide strollers stood wheel to wheel in a playground; their passengers were now busy scrambling up flat-top Mayan-style pyramids. And hundreds sat rapt on the museum's steps while a five-piece doo-wop group crooned Sam Cooke's ''Wonderful World,'' as if bidding a last hurrah to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On weekdays, a more subdued mood prevails along the well-scrubbed blocks, which have a reputation as beautiful and pricey. Passers-by are more accustomed to keeping company with the stone creatures crouching on the area's castlelike buildings -- the owls on the Ukrainian Institute of America on East 79th Street, say, or the cherubs at a converted condominium at 1200 Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contrasts like these are a distinguishing feature of Museum Mile, said Ron Berger, an advertising executive, who in 2008 moved from a four-bedroom house in Passaic County, N.J., to a two-bedroom co-op.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The windows of his corner unit, which cost $2.995 million, at once reveal the natural tableau of Central Park, and the architecture of the former Vanderbilt mansion that is home to the Neue Galerie New York, a museum of German and Austrian art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have this incredible building,'' Mr. Berger said, ''and when the leaves are down, you can also see lights coming through from cars on the park drive. It's one of those great New York views.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that the changes in scenery are always harmonious. The renovation of the Guggenheim Museum, at 88th Street, for example, drew complaints about its three-year duration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other museums have closed for extended periods while refurbishing, like El Museo del Barrio, on Fifth and 104th, which until October had been shut down for 17 months. Classroom trailers hog the yard of the Cooper-Hewitt museum, at 91st, while it expands, and Goethe-Institut New York, on Fifth at 83rd, will relocate to SoHo next month to allow for the installation of sprinklers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mount Sinai Medical Center has generated controversy with its plan for a 258-unit rental tower at 4 102nd Street, because at 45 stories it will be the highest structure around, even surpassing the black hulk of the Annenberg Building at Fifth and 99th.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new high-rise, being developed by Durst Fetner Residential, helps Mount Sinai finance a new wing. As part of the deal, the hospital, which did not return calls seeking comment, also sold Durst Fetner a prewar former rental at 1212 Fifth Avenue, which will house 63 condos, said Hal Fetner, the chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The address of 102nd and Fifth ''doesn't roll off people's tongue now,'' Mr. Fetner said, ''but we're trying to change that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is lingering ill will over the deal, said Matthew Washington, the chairman-elect of Manhattan Community Board 11, which opposed it. Height isn't the only objection, he said. There is also the fact that the building won't include housing more affordable to middle- or lower-income residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may not be an issue for the part of Museum Mile that runs through well-heeled Carnegie Hill, but in East Harlem, where the average annual income is $24,000, it's a serious shortcoming, he added, underscoring perhaps Museum Mile's most striking disparity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As buildings are converted, ''a lot of people are being displaced,'' Mr. Washington said, ''and we're fighting to keep them here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually measuring about a mile and a half in length, the rectangular neighborhood, bound thematically by museums, is bound geographically by Fifth and Madison Avenues, and East 79th and East 110th Streets, with much of it protected by two landmark districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the northern point sits the unfinished shell of the first museum to be built since the Guggenheim in 1959. (The Whitney opened in 1966 but is just south of Museum Mile.) Called the Museum for African Art, it will feature a three-level space topped by 116 condos. Its developer is Brickman; Robert A.M. Stern is the architect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though initially scheduled for a 2009 completion, the building is now to be finished in June, with the condos following next winter, said Roderick O'Connor, a Brickman principal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Facing it is Arthur A. Schomburg Plaza, a twin-towered complex recently removed from the Mitchell-Lama affordable housing program and rebranded as the ''Heritage at Schomburg Plaza.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Side streets nearby, like East 105th, contain worn apartments laced with fire escapes; better-aged row houses, whose earth-toned stone facades recall battlements, stand on East 94th.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Squeezed amid taller buildings to the south are Beaux-Arts town houses with lanterns, balconies and verdigris roofs, like the one owned by Mayor Bloomberg on East 79th. Condos are part of the mix, too: The soaring 30 East 85th was completed in 1987.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Museum Mile is probably best known for elegant brick co-ops, including a dozen designed by J. E. R. Carpenter, who can count Dr. Marianne Legato, an internist and cardiologist, among his fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Dr. Legato left her rental in the Manhattan House at East 66th Street, where she had lived for 40 years, and paid $2.1 million for a six-room unit at 1150 Fifth. Though it required a ''significant'' redo, she said, the building's architecture is worth it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I came into my beautiful lobby, with its lovely proportions,'' she said, ''I thought, 'This is the place for me.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales activity has dropped significantly along Museum Mile, though prices remain strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From January to mid-November of 2007, near the market's peak, there were 252 sales of co-ops, condos and town houses, for an average price of $4.2 million, according to sales data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices ranged from $399,000, for a 400-square-foot co-op at 1361 Madison Avenue, to $46 million for a seven-bedroom co-op at 1060 Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year has seen 94 deals, a 63 percent decrease, largely in line with Manhattan as a whole. Prices have barely budged; the average is $4.01 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you did not have to sell your apartment,'' said Liz Fishman, a Stribling broker, ''you didn't put it on the market, because you would get a reduced price.'' Many sellers ''figure, let's wait till the market comes up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public schools are mixed. At Central Park East 2, which teaches kindergarten through fifth grade, 63 percent of fourth-graders met state standards last year in math while 44 percent did so in English. Citywide, those percentages were 85 and 69.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Public School 171, which teaches kindergarten through eighth grade, 100 percent of fourth-graders met standards in math and 98 percent in English. In eighth grade, percentages were 90 and 57, versus 71 and 57 citywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Park East High School last year SAT averages were 407 in math, 391 in reading and 390 in writing, versus 515, 502 and 494 statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such are the area's contrasts that it is hard to throw a squash ball and not hit a private school. St. David's, St. Bernard's, Dalton, Spence and Nightingale-Bamford are all here or close by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's the park, of course. But save for sidewalk vendors, Fifth Avenue here doesn't offer much shopping. For that, residents head to Madison, which is chockablock with boutiques, including hip clothing stores for kids, between 86th and 90th Streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the window of Greenstones, Too, recently, there was a child-size three-quarter-sleeve T-shirt emblazoned with a motorcycle, while Bonpoint displayed designer denim. Parents might savor the Corner Bookstore, which casts a warm glow on an evening sidewalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nos. 4, 5 and 6 subway lines stop at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue. Local 6 service is available at 77th, 96th and 103rd Streets. But to avoid the eastward walk, some residents opt for the bus, including the M1, M2, M3 and M4, which offer limited-stop service along Fifth Avenue to Midtown in 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frawley Circle, the Columbus-Circle-like roundabout with skinny trees at Central Park's northeastern corner, was named for James J. Frawley, a state senator who also ran the construction company that built the Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges. The statue that anchors the circle, however, is of Duke Ellington, the jazz musician, immortalized here because of his Harlem connection, alongside a grand piano.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DURING the two years that their two-bedroom Glen Cove colonial was on the market, Jenna Caggiano and Rich Peck would often return home after yet another real estate open house to find dinner ready. Their brokers -- Natalie C. McCray and Eileen B. Heimer of Daniel Gale <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> -- had cooked it during the event, between visits from potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Heimer ''would have a pot roast going,'' recalled Ms. Caggiano, a teacher. Or she might have taken sausage out of the freezer and made pasta with sauce. ''We would come home and have a whole meal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At other times, Ms. Heimer baked cookies and was a baby sitter for the two young Peck children. Ms. McCray took care of the family dog, Reese, moved furniture and packed up clutter. She helped Mr. Peck take the dining-room doors off their hinges, carry them outside and paint them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With houses sitting on the market longer, Ms. McCray said, ''the whole process is more intense and stressful on the sellers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To reduce that stress and temper the disappointment of lower sale prices -- and also to keep clients from dropping them for another agent partway through a seemingly endless sales process -- some brokers are significantly expanding their job descriptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond rearranging furniture and decluttering, they take on jobs like plant watering, bed making and floor scrubbing; they check on homes when the owners are out of town; and sometimes even apply a coat of sealer to the driveway or do real estate-related paperwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extra duties performed by Ms. Heimer and Ms. McCray were definitely a factor in the sale of the family's home in August for about $290,000, Ms. Caggiano said. The young couple who bought it remarked that they had been drawn to the house partly by ''the homey feeling'' of dinner cooking on the stove.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a little Norman Rockwell scene, and we were selling the house at the same time,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McCray, extolling the therapeutic benefits of her friendly approach, put it this way: ''We are not just selling a house. We are helping people go through this tough process. How do you help make this better for them, or more comfortable? We can't just sell real estate like we used to sell real estate. We have to go a little further.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the interest of keeping his clients happy, after a ranch house he listed was inspected, Ed Schmid, an agent with Winkler Real Estate in West Islip, climbed a tree and cut off a limb that was hanging over the house. He put a fresh seal coat on the driveway, after asking the homeowner to buy the supplies. He often shovels snow for his clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Instead of telling somebody to hire someone,'' Mr. Schmid said, ''I take care of it for them. It keeps them loyal to me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that even if the house sits on the market awhile, ''with all the things I have done for them, they stay with me. They will re-sign.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with potential clients, he volunteers to help with basement cleanouts, though he does charge a fee unless he gets the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a free ''concierge service'' for some clients, Jamie Winkler, the owner of Winkler Real Estate, plans to submit an application in Babylon for a variance for a rear deck built 20 years ago without the proper permit. Ms. Winkler said the homeowners were leaving the paperwork to her ''because they get uncomfortable about not knowing how to do it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says she regularly orders new property surveys and obtains certificates of occupancy and compliance. She attends variance hearings for the sellers and buyers she represents, without charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't get a mortgage unless everything is up to date and legal,'' she said, expressing eagerness to ''facilitate getting the house in order'' and make the process and eventual closing ''as comfortable as possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other day, Faith Kanen, an associate broker in the East Norwich office of Shawn Elliott Luxury Homes and Estates, washed the front-door transom of a $2 million home in Brookville she was trying to sell. ''The glass panels on either side of the door were dirty,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the huge diamond engagement ring that she wears, Ms. Kanen isn't shy about getting down on her hands and knees to clean stains out of carpets or, as she did on a $1.8 million house in Laurel Hollow, to stain old kitchen cabinets. ''The cabinets were walnut and showed a lot of wear,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has patched up loose wallpaper, put away dishes left in a dishwasher, cleaned kitchen counters and peeled very resistant Scotch tape from refrigerators or walls that used to bear children's artwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Describing herself as an expert at cleaning, she also routinely provides clients with a four-page-long list of housework tips, like what products and method to use in cleaning a marble or granite floor. (To a large pail of water, add a capful of white vinegar and another of Spic and Span. Dip a small towel in the mixture, wring it out and use a shoelace to wrap it around a sponge mop. Then apply elbow grease.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just have to do what it takes to make it look most desirable,'' she said. ''The competition is keen, and there are so many houses for sale and less customers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Adams, a managing partner at Century 21 American Homes in Babylon Village, said her agents had been doing garage sales at no cost to clients; getting furnaces fixed; mowing lawns; or picking up the cost of a lawn-care service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While parents shop for real estate, one agent serves as a baby sitter and another shows homes. Once a home sells, agents take elderly homeowners shopping for boxes and moving supplies and help them pack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is the psychological end of all of this, pretty much holding their hand through everything,'' Ms. Adams said. ''Years ago, it was more about the real estate, about, 'Here are the homes, choose one.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTO: THAT'S SERVICE!: Eileen B. Heimer, far left, and Natalie C.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AL ANDREWS, who lives on Tennessee Street in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, said he didn't mind the tour buses coming through his neighborhood, but he wished the visitors ''would give some of what they pay to the community.'' Mr. Andrews lives in one of the brightly colored, modernist houses rising on a small patch of the Lower Ninth, four years after it was devastated by Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, frustrated by the slow pace of rebuilding in the Lower Ninth, Brad Pitt set up a foundation called Make It Right; the foundation then commissioned 13 architecture firms to design affordable, green houses. The organization plans to build 150 homes, all for returning Lower Ninth residents. So far, just 15 of them are occupied, but those 15 make a big impression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, from the main route into the Lower Ninth, the Claiborne Avenue Bridge, it's impossible to miss the Brad Pitt Houses, as everyone here calls them. They are sprawling, angular buildings in bold hues not usually seen outside a gelateria. Monuments to the city's resilience, and to Hollywood's big heart, they are also New Orleans's newest tourist attraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tour buses, including those of Cajun Encounters (504-834-1770; www.cajunencounters.com[http://www.cajunencounters.com]) and Gray Line (504-587-0709; www.graylineneworleans.com[http://www.graylineneworleans.com]), pass by the houses but don't stop to let passengers walk around. You can also take a taxi the five miles or so from the city's center to the Lower Ninth; the round-trip fare is under $30. (Virginia Miller, a spokeswoman for Make It Right, said the organization may eventually offer tours, but ''right now the priority is getting residents settled.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I drove a rental car, following MapQuest directions, to the intersection of Tennessee and North Galvez Streets, near the heart of the new enclave. I found that residents like Mr. Andrews and his neighbor, Gertrude LeBlanc, were happy to converse. ''If we don't talk,'' Ms. LeBlanc, a cheerful septuagenarian, said, ''how will people know what happened to us?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During my previous trip to the Lower Ninth four years ago, I mainly saw devastation. Wrecked houses were everywhere. Now much of the debris has been cleared, and acre after acre has gone back to nature, with grass almost as high as the reconstructed levees. The main effect in much of the district is an eerie stillness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ''Brad Pitt's neighborhood'' is a beehive of activity, with builders and landscapers vastly outnumbering residents. A sign in front of each of the houses gives the name and city of its architect. One, called the Float House, was designed by the Pritzker Prize-winner Thom Mayne of Los Angeles. The main part of the house is built to rise with surging flood waters, on pylons that keep it from coming loose. It's difficult to see the innovative foundation, but unusual external features are easy to spot, such as a kind of trellis cut into intricate patterns and painted turquoise, set against the raspberry-hued building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby, an angular house by GRAFT, a multinational architecture firm, features a porch enclosure that looks as though it had been cracked open by a storm, an unfortunate visual resonance. A house by the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban has a private courtyard space between the living room and bedrooms, but none of the detailing that would make it feel like a part of New Orleans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the houses seem better suited to an exhibition of avant-garde architecture than to a neighborhood struggling to recover. A number of designers I talked to, some of whom had visited the neighborhood, lamented the absence of familiar forms that would have comforted returning residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Dart, a Manhattan-based architect who was born and raised in New Orleans, described the houses as ''alien, sometimes even insulting,'' adding, ''the biggest problem is that they are not grounded in the history of New Orleans architecture.'' But, like other architects I spoke to, he expressed admiration for Mr. Pitt. ''He deserves a great deal of credit,'' Mr. Dart said, adding that Mr. Pitt had ''done more for New Orleans'' than any government agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Pearl, a broker who has several houses for sale in the Lower Ninth, has a practical view. ''Brad has the very best intentions,'' she said. ''However, had he come here with houses that looked like what had been here before, he probably could have had four times, five times as many houses up by now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another issue with the houses (except for Mr. Mayne's) is their elevation: to protect them from future floods, they have been built on stilts that turn their front porches into catwalks. The goal of porches is to create a sense of community, and that's hard to do when neighbors and passersby are literally overshadowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like New York -- you know, the skyscrapers,'' said Ms. LeBlanc, who lives in a single-story house next to one of the much larger Make It Right creations, like a Mini Cooper boxed in by SUVs. ''And there are going to be more,'' she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To most residents, the construction is simply good news. ''It's hard living here now, but it's going to be worth it,'' said Melba Leggett-Barnes, a cafeteria worker, who is concerned about crime in the neighborhood. The lack of commercial activity is also disappointing. ''We used to be able to go to the corner store,'' she said. ''Now we don't have a grocery; we don't have a laundry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Leggett-Barnes, whose house was designed by the Philadelphia firm KieranTimberlake, is -- literally -- the poster child for Make It Right; her image, plastered on bus-shelter signs around the city, urges former residents to return to the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There may be people who want to move back,'' she said, ''but don't know that it's possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some visitors also make a stop at the other end of the Lower Ninth, on Andry Street, where three houses built by Global Green (another Brad Pitt-supported charity) stand bright and inviting -- and unoccupied. The houses, by Andrew Kotchen and Matthew Berman of Workshop/APD in New York, are listed for $175,000. (One of them is open to visitors; Monday and Friday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.; or call 504-525-2121 for an appointment.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the Make It Right houses, which are reserved for returning residents of the Lower Ninth, the Global Greens are available to anyone. ''We'd love it if you'd buy one,'' Ms. Pearl said, a hopeful lilt in her voice.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All roads into and out of the recession run through the housing market. During the summer, that road seemed to be heading toward recovery. These days, it seems to be headed back toward hard times. A reversal would have big implications for the economy and, by extension, the policies now being pursued by the administration, Congress and the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported this month that new-home construction fell sharply in October. That led many economists to reduce their estimates for economic growth in the current quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even this month's other seemingly good news had a dark lining. Reports from industry and government showed that sales of both new and existing homes rose in October. But much of that was driven by buyers who rushed to claim the first-time home buyer's tax credit before it expires on Nov. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the credit has since been extended, it is not expected to spur many more sales anytime soon, in part because many buyers who would have been in the market in 2010 bought in advance of the first expiration date. The mini-frenzy of buying also did not prop up prices much, as a glut of homes on the market has depressed home prices over all. By conservative estimates, prices are now expected to fall by another 10 percent next year, bringing the average decline nationwide to 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A weakening housing market in a fragile economy is a recipe for pain. Already, nearly a third of homeowners with a mortgage -- 15.7 million people -- owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. Negative equity combined with high unemployment greatly increases the risk of delinquencies and foreclosures, which, not surprisingly, continue to hit new highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A question for policy makers is, if real estate is not going to lead the way out of recession, what will? A related issue is where best to aim government resources as the hard times endure. The extension of the home buyer's tax credit, which failed in its first go-round to spark lasting improvements, was a giveaway to the real estate industry. Relief and recovery efforts that are focused on job creation more directly, rather than on favored industries, are needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration must also be prepared to alter its anti-foreclosure effort if, as expected, foreclosures surge again in 2010. And the Federal Reserve, whose interventions have sustained the housing market over the past year, must show flexibility. The Fed has made it clear that it would prefer to begin withdrawing support for the market in the months ahead. But without other strong and successful fiscal measures in place, that could do more harm than good.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last season, the veteran fullback Tony Richardson came to the Jets as a free agent, but he remained tethered to Minnesota by real estate. As the house Richardson bought during his two seasons with the Vikings languished on the market, he began paying rent in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brett Favre also joined the Jets that season, coming in a trade from the Packers and soon he and Richardson were bonding over the headaches of trying to sell in a difficult real estate market. So when Favre became a Viking this season, he knew exactly where to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now all of a sudden he comes out of retirement, he calls me and asks me, could he rent my place?'' Richardson said. ''And of course it's worked out. I think he's playing well enough now, hopefully he'll rent it out again next year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professional athletes have always been a transient band -- whether relocated through free agency or traded on a moment's notice to a new team in a new city. But now, given the decline in home values resulting from the recession and the high rates of unemployment, moving on has become that much more complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The economic conditions affect us just like they affect everyone else and it's really tough, particularly when you have property that you're trying to sell,'' said defensive lineman Chris Canty, who came to the Giants this spring and still has a home in Dallas that he is trying to sell. Players who were often advised that real estate was a solid investment are now trying to figure out how to protect their investments and weather this market -- be it selling at a loss or renting to other players. The experience has changed the way some players view home ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'll never buy again,'' said the veteran Nets guard Keyon Dooling, who rents the downtown Orlando condominium he bought in 2005 to a Magic player. ''That was a learning experience. I'll never buy again as far as where I'm playing. It's not a good idea because you can never predict how long you're going to be in a situation. You could be stuck with a piece of property that you never go to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dooling's teammate Courtney Lee, a rookie with the Magic last season, considered buying in the same condominium building before Dooling advised him against it. Good thing, since Lee is now with the Nets, where he rents on a month-to-month basis from the former Net Bostjan Nachbar, who is playing in Turkey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A word-of-mouth network has developed among players, and often an N.F.L. or an N.B.A. team representative will pass along news of possible rentals to incoming players. The N.H.L. players' association has a Web site that lists homes the league's players are trying to sell or rent. It adds a sense of confidence to rent to someone within the sports community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giants linebacker Danny Clark has rented his unsold mansion in Berkeley, Calif., where he played for the Raiders in 2004 and 2005, to other Raiders, and recently dropped the $4 million asking price by a million dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You know where he works,'' Clark said of renting to other players. ''You can't say you know he's going to have a job, but you know where he works. It's a fraternity. Word travels fast if you get messed over by somebody in your business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some players wind up back in the city they left, in the house they were trying to sell. It happened with the new Devils left wing Dean McAmmond, who left and later returned to Calgary. Jets kicker Jay Feely bought his Upper Saddle River, N.J., home as a Giant in 2005 then returned last season as a Jet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feely had previously purchased in Tampa, Fla., and Atlanta and said he sold for a profit each time. But his home in Upper Saddle River sat on the market while he played -- and bought again -- in Miami. After one season, Feely found himself back with the Jets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Walked in, took the For Sale sign down and moved right back in,'' Feely said with a laugh. ''Although last year I had no furniture. I didn't even have a kitchen table. I didn't know if I'd be back, so I didn't want to buy any furniture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feely rents his Miami home to a Dolphin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jets linebacker Bart Scott is not interested in renting the Baltimore-area home he just put on the market for $650,000. Scott, who purchased the house for $850,000 in 2005 and put in about $300,000 worth of upgrades, including a home theater, said athletes had other concerns when it came to selling, such as a parade of curiosity-seekers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to guard against that because some people just want to see what's in your house,'' Scott said. ''A lot of people have no intention of buying.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott said his long-term contract allowed him to buy a similar home in New Jersey despite having another house. The highest-paid athletes can do that, but mid-tier players may have a greater percentage of their equity tied up in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Rolston, a veteran left wing who came to the Devils in 2008 from Minnesota, said that financially he ''got killed'' in order to sell his house quickly when he left the Wild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're obviously paid well but when you're hanging onto two mortgages, $600-$700,000, that's not an easy thing to keep up with,'' he said. ''We took a big hit on it, but we thought it was better to get out of it than hold onto it. There were guys on this team that got traded the year before and they were holding onto their house for three years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jets player development coordinator Dave Szott said he told incoming players that unless they had a long-term contract they should rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The last thing you want to worry about is mortgages and loans and cutting the grass,'' Szott said. ''Why create more stress?''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- -- As fires raged downtown after the 1906 earthquake, residents of this city fled to two nearby districts to the south, Bernal Heights and Glen Park. Though part of San Francisco, both areas looked more like countryside then, with open ranchland, vineyards and orchards, dirt roads and wetlands, and a few houses. The windswept peaks above Glen Park were called Little Switzerland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the earthquake refugees wound up settling there, and both neighborhoods also attracted waves of new immigrants. Today, Glen Park and Bernal Heights, two distinctive communities little more than a mile apart and accessible on foot from the Glen Park BART train station, retain a self-contained village atmosphere as well as some of their wild, open vistas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visitors to San Francisco can linger two or three days off the tourist track in this hilly and little-known tangle of streets, hiking, picnicking on fresh California fare and working up an appetite for the dozens of international restaurants and cafes they'll find.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a jog to trendy Noe Valley to the north and a side trip to the nearby Mission Dolores, the itinerary includes both the hip and the historical. It's a San Francisco even some natives don't know. Hotels are scarce, but house and apartment rentals are even better, since they make it possible to shop at local specialty food shops and cook at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernal Heights Natural Area, a 24-acre knob of red Franciscan chert that rises from a sea of colorful row houses like the prow of a ship, has a 360-degree view of San Francisco in its pastel glory. The city ripples into the distance in all directions: from the downtown skyscrapers and Golden Gate mist to Candlestick Park and the industrial East Bay, and to San Bruno Mountain to the south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As one of the city's largest off-leash dog parks, this park, elevation 433 feet, attracts mostly locals who come to get a daily dose of fresh air for themselves or their pets. Wildflowers around the margin shelter small birds and mammals and butterflies. Hawks hunt overhead (and owls at night), and the whole area lies in the Pacific Flyway for migratory birds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many approaches to the Bernal Heights park, notably from the south and west on the many side streets off Cortland Avenue -- the neighborhood's commercial artery -- or off Mission Street, its western boundary (except for Mitchell's Ice Cream parlor a block farther west, at 688 San Jose Avenue). An easy approach is Bernal Heights Boulevard which circles the park. The 24th Street Mission BART stop is actually closer to Bernal Heights than is the Glen Park station, but the walk from there has little scenic appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights of Cortland Avenue include Good Life Grocery, which stocks sourdough bread, cheese, chocolate, fruit, wine and other picnic supplies; Moonlight Cafe and Crepe House for a hearty brunch; and the sunny Red Hill Books for an upbeat selection of new and used titles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More so than Bernal Heights, Glen Park feels like a real town, with a dry cleaner, a hardware store, a library branch, liquor stores and a first-rate greasy-spoon diner. But there are also superb restaurants, specialty groceries large and small, and a landmark bookstore and performance space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood's main attraction, however, is Glen Canyon Park, a 70-acre swath of city-owned wilderness nestled in a sweeping ravine and just out of sight of several major roads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning about six blocks up from the Glen Park BART station, at the end of Bosworth Street, a trail just under a mile long ascends steadily through dense creekside forest, then over a meadow dotted with trees and boulders -- a place for sunbathing or bird-watching -- and finally to a nearly hidden shopping center with yet more good eating and million-dollar views of downtown San Francisco far below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good day's outing from Glen Park starts with breakfast at Tyger's, a coffee shop at the corner of Diamond and Chenery Streets, north of the BART station, or at the fragrant and light-washed Destination Baking Company, a block east. Then, shop for picnic provisions at Canyon Market, on Diamond, followed by a leisurely hike up Glen Canyon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next, descend steep walkways around Diamond Heights Boulevard and Gold Mine Drive, through the rainbow-hued residential streets of Noe Valley for a coffee break on 24th Street or lower Castro, then back to Glen Park for dinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 24th Street and adjacent Church Street commercial districts in Noe Valley are home to specialty groceries like Drewes Brothers Meats, 24th Street Cheese Company and Church Produce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a very different Glen Park tour, walk downhill (east) on Bosworth Street from the BART station, then left on Mission Street to St. Mary's Avenue. There, the impressive Old World profile of St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church towers over quiet streets where thousands of recent immigrants have made their homes alongside generations of longtime San Franciscans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nearby Manila Oriental Market on Mission Street offers a supermarket-size assortment of Asian groceries for this new population, including a selection of exotic seafood, both in tanks and on ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's another example that away from San Francisco's worthwhile but overcrowded tourist stops, the city remains fresh and unpredictable in these two ever-changing and compact communities.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, as the real estate markets for offices, residences and stores in New Jersey have gone through peaks and valleys, the market for industrial real estate has been like the buildings themselves -- not flashy, but big, solid and reliable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No longer. The tenor of third-quarter market reports about the warehouse sector has ranged from unhappy to abysmal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One big commercial real estate services concern, <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, reported, for instance, that 11.7 percent of the state's industrial property was available for either purchase or lease as of Sept. 30. That was the highest rate it has recorded since 1992 and a 32 percent rise in 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another company, Cushman &amp; Wakefield, uses somewhat different parameters in its calculations, but said it agreed with the ''thrust and reasoning'' of CBRE's report. Its measure of the vacancy rate for warehouses and distribution centers was 8.8 percent as of Sept. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, industrial specialists said that asking rents were plummeting statewide, and that in many submarkets, effective rents were the lowest in a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two large industrial areas off the New Jersey Turnpike that have traditionally had robust real estate trade -- the Exit 8A and 7A submarkets, as they are known -- the property availability rate is 24 and 29 percent, respectively, said David Knee, an industrial specialist and managing director with <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, another commercial real estate company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Staggering,'' Mr. Knee said. ''I haven't seen it in all my 21 years in the business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The iPort 12 International Trade and Logistics Center, a huge ''intermodal'' facility only four miles from the Port of Newark, finally found its first tenant in August, almost two years after construction was finished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Graybar Electric Company</span> took 136,250 square feet at the 1.2-million-square-foot facility, which is off Turnpike Exit 12 in Carteret. The warehouse has 36-foot ceilings and can handle shipments arriving by rail, road or water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Graybar, a Fortune 500 company that distributes electrical and communications products, had planned to buy a building in New York. Instead, it secured a 10-year lease with multiple ''incentives,'' including a period of free rent, according to its broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The iPort building is one of several behemoths that were started on speculation a few years ago, during a period when demand seemed insistent for more big-box distribution centers at strategic locations in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then the national economy swooned. Retail business shriveled, the tonnage of goods being delivered at New Jersey ports slipped and the ''monster'' industrial buildings -- as Cushman's industrial specialist, Stanley B. Danzig, terms anything over 750,000 square feet -- became functionally obsolete, in some cases before they were finished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When spec building is going on, the idea among developers is: Let's make it as big as the municipality will allow, with minimum 36-foot ceilings -- clear height'' for trucks, ''superflat floors, everything perfect -- and see what rent we can get,'' said Mr. Danzig, a broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Landlords who had been hoping to lease these full-building monsters are now acquiescing to partial-building deals,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even smaller buildings are breaking up space for multiple users. Mr. Danzig mentioned a recent deal that his company had brokered for about half the space in a new 340,000-square-foot building in the port service area of Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Huge blocks of space are apparently no longer in demand. ''The only sweet spot for deals,'' said William Waxman, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, ''is for those under 250,000 square feet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers said the only activity is in ''blends and extends,'' their term for deals in which a company consolidates its space from more than one building to a single site, or extends a current lease while taking less space -- ordinarily, in these times, at a reduced rental rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average asking rent for industrial property as of Sept. 30 was $5.66 a square foot a year, down from $6.14 last year at that point, according to CBRE's numbers. In central New Jersey, south of Trenton, the price drops have been particularly sharp, according to CBRE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actual rents being paid after concessions and discounts are taken into account are consistently below asking rates, the company said. In central New Jersey, average paid rates were reported to have fallen 19 cents, to $5.04 a square foot, in the third quarter alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Knee of Jones LaSalle said he knew of a recent deal in the 7A submarket in which the effective rent worked out to less than $3 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fundamental reason for all this is that retail demand is way off,'' said David T. Houston Jr. of <span class="companylink">Colliers Houston &amp; Company</span>, who said he has been in the business for more than 30 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the bleak numbers, however, Mr. Houston claims the sector is not moribund. ''I still get a call every day from somebody looking to buy industrial property in New Jersey,'' he said. ''And we still have the tenth-lowest vacancy rate of any market in the country.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just sold a building in Edison to the AriZona Beverage Company,'' the producer of AriZona Tea, he added. The company purchased a 500,000-square-foot building owned by the industrial development and management company <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> to use for bottle distribution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The food and beverage industries are holding steady better than the retail sector, Mr. Houston noted. But ''the users of the 'big boxes' are typically retailers,'' said Mindy Lissner, an industrial specialist with CBRE. ''They are pretty much out of the market for a while.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consistently ranked as the third- or fourth-largest market in the country, New Jersey's industrial sector ''is in no danger of dying or disappearing as a regional hub'' because of its location in a densely populated region, Mr. Danzig said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The big companies still need to distribute consumer goods from Washington to Boston,'' he said. ''That's not going to change. But people's appetite for goods is down at the moment, and it's going to take time -- who knows how long -- until it revives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Various analysts also noted that new construction had come to a virtual halt, which meant existing available space would be absorbed sooner. Cushman &amp; Wakefield says that while some two million square feet of development was under way last year at this time, only 200,000 square feet was under construction in the third quarter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are enduring an early winter chill, raising the odds that the economy may suffer another jolt while it is still weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two price indexes released Tuesday indicated that the momentum the housing market showed over the late spring and summer is faltering, even as the government said the economy grew at a slower pace in the third quarter than previously reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price index, a closely watched measure of the housing markets in 20 metropolitan areas, barely rose in September, rising 0.3 percent from August on a seasonally adjusted basis. Prices fell for the month in nine cities in the index, including Boston, New York, Seattle and Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report from the Federal Housing Financing Agency showed that prices were flat in September from August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate, which has traditionally brought the economy out of recession, seems increasingly likely this time to hold it back. The housing market's epic boom early this decade has turned into an epic bust whose effects may take years to shake off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is confronting an abundance of inventory, high unemployment, fearful consumers and devastated family balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no clear, easy way out for housing,'' said John Silvia, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>. ''Contrary to my hopes, housing prices and the housing market in general will weaken again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He forecast a new decline in prices of as much as 10 percent, which he expected to shave a half-point off the nation's economic output just as it emerges from the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said the economy grew at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter, down from the 3.5 percent rate reported last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revised number, based on more complete data, was in line with analyst expectations. It was larger than the typical adjustment, underscoring the erratic nature of the recovery. But although growth was slower, the third quarter ended the longest economic contraction since World War II, with the economy expanding for the first time in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little of this recovery is reflected in housing prices, which are limping despite improved sales volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index, which covers about 45 percent of the United States housing market, is a three-month moving average. Since July and August were relatively strong, the weak September report could indicate a plunge in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> uses data from the government mortgage agencies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which until recently were limited to loans below $417,000. Its index tends to swing less widely than Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two housing price reports lag, by a month, the figures on the volume of home resales, which were issued Monday for October. Home resales jumped 10.1 percent to the highest level in two years, better than analysts had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the increase was attributed to the $8,000 first-time buyer's tax credit, which had been set to expire Nov. 30 but has been renewed through spring. Buyers who have already owned a home are now eligible for a $6,500 credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While brisk sales volume should, in theory, push up prices, Maureen Maitland, the vice president for index services at S.&amp; P., said the oversupply of inventory was acting as a brake. ''You can look down the street and have 10 houses to choose from,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 3.57 million used homes are for sale, a number that has been declining but is still higher than the historic average. It represents seven months of inventory at the current sales rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Maitland speculated that the housing market might follow a ''W'' pattern, as the price lows plumbed last spring are tested again this winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is going to be more moderation and downturn in the coming months,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While that might be good for prospective buyers, it would put more stress on would-be sellers and everyone who looks to his or her house to measure net worth and ability to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers are much poorer than they were, and are acting accordingly. Consumer spending in the third quarter increased 2.9 percent, less than the 3.4 percent originally reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That number worried some economists, who said it was below healthy margins and even lower than growth levels in 1983, when joblessness was as high. Consumer spending makes up about 70 percent of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julia Coronado, senior United States economist at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>, said the revised figures suggested economic renewal would be mild indeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to be a very gradual pace of recovering instead of a roaring return to business as usual,'' she said. ''The G.D.P. number highlights this recovery is different from prior recoveries.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also released Tuesday was the S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. That index covers a broader segment of the market, about 75 percent, but is released quarterly, rather than monthly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national index showed an 8.9 percent decline in the third quarter of 2009 from the third quarter of 2008, a substantial improvement over the 14.7 percent decline in the annual rate of return in the second quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite such improvements, it will be a long time under the most favorable circumstances before housing recovers what it lost. The 20-city composite index is off nearly 10 percent in the last year and 29.1 percent since its 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Las Vegas have declined for 37 months and are down more than half from their peak. At the other extreme is Dallas, which did not have much of a boom and thus did not have so far to fall. Prices there are only down about 5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida has been ravaged almost as much as Las Vegas. About a quarter of its homeowners with mortgages are late with payments. But even there, some people are still buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're not buying as investors, they're buying as homeowners,'' said Grant Stern of Morningside Mortgage Corporation in Bay Harbor Islands, Fla., near Miami Beach. ''Nobody expects a 50 percent gain. Flat is the new up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Mr. Stern's clients is Howard Roth, who recently moved to Florida from Oakland, Calif., where he lived in an apartment. He closed on a house in Boca Raton on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wanted a dog, and a yard for a dog,'' Mr. Roth, a 61-year-old retiree, said. The turmoil in the market did not faze him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''America always bounces back,'' he said. ''Somebody's got to make a move.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home Sales in October Rose to a 2-Year High</span>
</div><div class="author">By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ   </div><div>575 words</div><div>24 November 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in October rose to the highest level in more than two years, according to a report released Monday, driven by the popularity of a credit for first-time home buyers. The surge far outpaced expectations and nurtured hope that the stubbornly frail housing market might be on the upswing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes were up 10.1 percent in October to an annual rate of 6.1 million, the National Association of Realtors said in a report Monday. That was a level last seen in February 2007, before the collapse of the housing sector. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News had predicted a 2.3 percent increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group attributed the gain to the popularity of a government-financed credit of up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers. The credit was originally set to expire at the end of November, and economists said the looming deadline probably provoked a buying frenzy in October. (Earlier this month, lawmakers voted to extend the credit through April.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories continued to shrink, the report said, and prices, while still lower, fell by the smallest amount in more than a year. Sales of lower-cost homes fueled the gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total sales were up 23.5 percent from the October 2008 rate of 4.94 million. In addition, sales for the 12-month period from October 2008 to October 2009 reached 4.4 million, up slightly from the October 2007 to October 2008 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains, which were most robust in the Midwest and weakest in the West, surprised even Lawrence Yun, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. Mr. Yun cautioned that future results might be more modest. ''With such a sale spike, a measurable decline should be anticipated in December and early next year before another surge in spring and early summer,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists closely monitor trends in home sales because their effects ripple through the economy. Consumers, in effect, are not just buying houses: they are also furnishing them with items like washers, tables and mattresses, and they must take out loans to finance them. Once Americans begin to spend again, analysts expect businesses will resume hiring and the economy will be on firmer ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report examined sales of single-family homes, as well as condos and co-ops. The group revised its September figures, saying home sales rose by 8.8 percent rather than the 9.4 percent it originally reported, to an annual rate of 5.54 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even amid inklings of a turnaround for the housing market, there are still reminders that the sector remains very weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celia Chen, senior director at Moody'sEconomy.com, noted that sales of existing homes -- especially those that have been foreclosed and tend to be cheaper -- might be slowing the pace of home construction, as builders grapple with low demand for expensive new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing sector needs help,'' she said. ''It's important to shore up the market because that is a large part of the economy and will be helpful in stabilizing the broader economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while home sales may be picking up, consumers are still struggling to keep up with bills. The Mortgage Bankers Association said last week that nearly one in 10 homeowners with mortgages -- about five million households -- was at least one payment behind in the third quarter.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ESTERO, Fla. -- Norman J. Radow brings out the worst in some people. They scream at him. They sue him. He has even been punched in the face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has he done to deserve this? In a word: workouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As founder of Radco Development Solutions, Mr. Radow is on the firing line in the continuing battle over failed residential real estate deals. Banks hire him to resurrect developments gone awry, particularly those half-empty condominium towers and gated communities that sprang up like weeds during the boom and are now in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Radow, a lawyer turned developer, has been plying his trade for 15 years. Day in, day out, he has to negotiate with unpaid contractors and architects, face enraged homeowners deprived of heat and hot water, and field calls from bankers anxious for solutions. Ride-alongs with him, then, essentially amount to tours through the still-tangled detritus of the real estate crisis -- with all accompanying venom, tantrums and raw emotions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last year, he says, has been utterly different from all the rest. It's not just that foreclosures and distressed properties are more numerous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People used to fight over the value of these projects,'' Mr. Radow says. ''It was almost like someone was throwing a $20 bill in the fire. Everybody jumped for it. Now nobody knows what they are worth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite being constantly slagged, Mr. Radow -- encased, it would seem, in an invisible sheet of Teflon -- is thriving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He is the guy who will take a bullet for the lenders without blinking an eye,'' says Dennis J. Powers, a lawyer in the Chicago office of <span class="companylink">DLA Piper</span> who has defended Mr. Radow in numerous lawsuits. ''It doesn't affect him the way it would you or me. It's just another day in the distressed real estate business for Norm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Radow estimates that his privately held company is trying to salvage $2 billion worth of distressed property around the country. One of his biggest clients is <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, which is liquidating its huge real estate portfolio to satisfy creditors after declaring bankruptcy last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radco manages two residential communities for the Lehman estate. One is the Mark, a 244-unit high-rise in San Diego, where 30 percent of the units are unsold. The other is the West Bay Beach and Golf Club here, an exclusive tropical haven with lavish amenities -- four restaurants, an 18-hole course, clay tennis courts and a Zen garden -- conceived for the thousands of people originally expected to buy homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, the West Bay Club has sold only 617 of the 1,054 dwellings originally planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Radow has been working for Lehman for a decade. Now he is branching out to hedge funds and private equity firms. Most of them praise him in private but are reluctant to do so publicly, as it would mean acknowledging they've made some grave errors that he's trying to fix for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An exception to this rule is TriLyn, a real estate investment firm in Greenwich, Conn. Mark Antoncic, its founding partner, says it recently persuaded a judge to hire Radco to manage Balsam Mountain Preserve, a residential community in western North Carolina, while TriLyn tries to remove the original developer. This private community offers owners of its $2 million ''homesteads'' activities including golf and horseback riding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's one problem: only 280 of the 400 lots in this rustic Shangri-La have been sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of hedge funds who bought high interest notes on properties like these never thinking that they'd wind up with the keys,'' says Mr. Antoncic. ''What are they going to do with these assets now? That's where Norm's business is going to grow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It certainly looks that way. Lenders are desperate to avoid the fate of Corus Bankshares, an aggressive condominium lender that federal regulators shut down in September after the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> concluded that the bank's $4 billion in assets were worth less than 60 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there is more distress to come. Foresights Analytics, a real estate consulting firm, estimates that 42 percent of the $25 billion in outstanding condo construction loans were delinquent in the third quarter this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Single-family homes are the largest piece of the overall problem,'' says Matthew Anderson, a partner at Foresight Analytics. ''But the severity of the condo sector is much worse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of would-be real estate titans are now rebranding themselves as workout specialists, but Mr. Radow's competitors may lack his tolerance for abuse. A divorced 52-year-old father of two, he grew up in the projects in East New York before moving to Atlanta in 1987. He is a gossipy, backslapping guy who mixes Yiddishisms with folksy Southern euphemisms. ''That dog don't hunt'' is one of his catchphrases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the tattered housing market, it may take years for him to generate enough sales for clients to get their investments back. So he advises patience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the last few years, developers would put out for-sale signs and they would sell these buildings out in three days,'' he sighs. ''Then they would put together a litigation budget in case they got sued and move on to the next deal. They didn't try to create a sense of community in these places. That's what we do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This, of course, is Mr. Radow's sales pitch to prospective clients. Yes, it is self-serving. But we have seen what happens when real estate developers and their financial enablers take short cuts. Maybe the time has arrived for a dose of his medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHERYL DEERING, the sales director at the West Bay Club, is behind the wheel of one of her club's silver Ford Explorers. She's a little uneasy. Mr. Radow, her relatively new boss, is riding along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The signs of yesteryear's real estate boom surround her. Almost every shopping center, every office building and every church appears to have risen from this flat, swampy terrain in the last decade -- making the evidence of the bust even more surreal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no coincidence that President Obama chose Fort Myers, north of Estero, to pitch his $787 billion economic stimulus proposal in February. The unemployment rate here in Lee County is 15 percent. Across the street from a new Super <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>, a nicely dressed young woman holds a cardboard sign up for passersby. It says: ''Out of work. Homeless.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before heading to the West Bay Club, Mr. Radow decides to take a detour through a competing luxury community where nervous residents are squaring off against a developer that had been hammed by the recession: the TwinEagles development of the Bonita Bay Group. It has a Jack Nicklaus golf course and a clubhouse fashioned after a Scottish manor. There are hiking paths and gardens where homeowners can see deer and wild turkey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the landscaping in TwinEagles is reverting to its natural state. The links are turning brown, and tiny spruce trees are sprouting in the sand traps. The Bonita Bay Group is trying to sell the golf course to its residents to raise money. Owners in TwinEagles have stopped paying their dues in protest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to take a couple of million dollars to bring this back,'' says Mr. Radow. ''Sheryl, could you sell anything in here today?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Deering shakes her head. She knows this all too well. She owns two overgrown TwinEagles lots and the sight of them makes her forlorn. For Mr. Radow, Twin Eagles reminds him of exactly what he wanted to avoid when he took over the troubled West Bay Club for <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> a year ago. (In November, Brian Lucas, vice chairman of the Bonita Bay Group, acknowledged the strife at TwinEagles, but said the golf club had reopened.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West Bay was started by <span class="companylink">Atlantic Gulf Communities</span>, a highflying Miami company that began construction with a $22.5 million loan from Lehman a decade ago and then defaulted, leaving the mess in its lender's hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman put West Bay in the hands of Carmine Visone, one of Lehman's managing directors, and he set out to turn it into a pleasure dome with five condominium towers. The club unveiled its plans for the first two towers in 2005, holding a lush party for brokers. It presold 90 percent of the first one in two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by the time those towers were finished in 2007, the market had turned. ''People started walking away from their deposits,'' says Ms. Deering. ''We'd never seen that before in the high-end market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Visone, who declined to be interviewed for this article, didn't seem particularly worried. He bought a $1.4 million condo and boasted last year to Executive Golfer about how much he enjoyed it. ''I'm an early riser,'' he told the magazine. ''I can't imagine a better way to start the day than to sit back with my wife on our 20th-floor terrace and enjoy a morning cup of coffee and watch the sunrise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything changed when Lehman imploded on Sept. 15, 2008. Mr. Visone lost his job and the bankrupt firm summoned Mr. Radow, who says he is still flabbergasted by Mr. Visone's work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Radow tours the towers with Paul A. Benson, the chief operating officer of the West Bay Club, a disagreement erupts. Mr. Benson oversaw construction of the two towers -- the other three were never built -- and he's proud of his work. Mr. Radow, on the other hand, keeps pointing out what he considers overly extravagant touches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No expense was spared in this place,'' he sighs, shaking his head and tapping the granite countertop in one of the bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Paul, what is this stuff?'' Mr. Radow asks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's Bahia granite,'' Mr. Benson says. ''It's imported from Brazil.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It must have cost a fortune,'' says Mr. Radow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't blame Carmine for this,'' Mr. Benson protests. ''This is nothing compared to what everybody else was doing. We had to be competitive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yeah, right,'' says Mr. Radow, under his breath. ''We all had to be stupid together. That's no defense.'' Mr. Benson steps into another room and begins yelling into his mobile phone at an underling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have to get rid of this guy,'' Kevin Price, Radco's vice president of condo operations, whispers to Mr. Radow. ''He's too emotional.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Radow acts as if he doesn't hear him. A few weeks later, Mr. Radow says Mr. Benson is leaving West Bay to start his own company, and both he and Mr. Benson say the departure is amicable. Mr. Radow praises Mr. Benson in an e-mail message for doing ''an amazing job'' but adds that he thinks he ''doesn't see the bigger picture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Benson, however, argues that the project will ultimately succeed because he didn't cut corners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE residents of West Bay were understandably skeptical when Mr. Radow first arrived. Some feared that he had come to Estero to break up the club and sell it off in pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At the first meeting, there was a lot of tension,'' recalls David Nevins, president of the West Bay Club Property Owner Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Radow tried to dispel the hostility and tackle the club's $2.5 million annual operating deficit. He opened the books to members, showing them that red ink flowed almost entirely from the unprofitable golf course and four money-losing restaurants. The property owners reluctantly conceded that some perks had to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radco closed the restaurants in the main clubhouse and the golf club and opened the course to guests from hotels like the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> in Naples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West Bay is now expected to end the year with a deficit of only $31,000. That pleases Mr. Nevins, 62, who has been Mr. Radow's fiercest critic at West Bay. Mr. Nevins is quick to point out that he knows something about the real estate business himself. He rents apartments in State College, Pa., to Penn State students and, as an avid golfer, he regularly e-mails Radco executives with complaints at 5 a.m., before he hits the links.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nevins calls Mr. Radow a ''schmoozer.'' Mr. Radow describes his sparring partner as a ''nudge.'' But these days, they are getting along better. ''I want to give Norm credit,'' says Mr. Nevins. ''He has done some major things in his first year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nevins, however, says ''the jury is still out'' on Radco. The firm is in delicate negotiations with PB Capital, West Bay's condo construction lender. The club's $17 million loan came due in March. Mr. Radow is confident that he can get an extension but concedes that the bank isn't making it easy for him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PB Capital, which did not respond to interview requests, might feel more comfortable if Radco was selling more condos at West Bay. But though it has discounted prices 35 percent and offered ''developer paid'' golf club memberships, it sold only five homes in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''West Bay may be a good community with a beautiful golf course,'' says Timothy S. Becker, director of the Kelley A. Bergstrom Center for Real Estate Studies at the University of Florida. ''They are doing O.K. But they are selling condos, and condos sales in Florida are not doing O.K.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Radow is undaunted. He says he expects sales to increase in the next few months as more snowbirds arrive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEW people set out to spend their days being harangued by condo owners. Mr. Radow certainly didn't. He found his true calling as a workout guy relatively late in life. He put himself through law school by fixing up and selling an apartment building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It never occurred to him that he might have a talent for turnarounds until he worked similar wonders with a down-on-its-luck hotel in Atlanta in 1994. His lender was <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>. The bank started parachuting Mr. Radow into its floundering residential real estate projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Norman has the ability to work with general contractors and ornery homeowners who are filing frivolous lawsuits,'' says David Broderick, a former managing director in Lehman's Global Real Estate Group and now a lawyer at <span class="companylink">Allen &amp; Overy</span>. ''He can handle all the dirty work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of Mr. Radow's assignments might as well have been combat duty. He mopped up a botched Chicago condo project after the developer defaulted on the mortgage and Lehman accused her in court records of taking buyers' deposits. A bankruptcy court judge later ruled in the investment bank's favor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, Lehman sent him to Boston to rescue a failed condo tower. There had been a fire after the bank foreclosed on the mortgage. Radco repaired the damage and quelled labor unrest. At one point, Mr. Radow says, a union elevator operator punched him in the face when he absent-mindedly pushed the button for his floor. ''He said, 'This is a union job!' '' Mr. Radow remembers, massaging his jaw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were some things his company couldn't fix. Ceilings in the tower were seven and a half feet high, about a foot and a half less than typically found in luxury condos. ''He tried to squeeze an extra floor into the building,'' Mr. Radow says of the project's developer, William Matt. Mr. Matt declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help solve the height problem, Mr. Radow hired only sales people who weren't much taller than 5 feet. He sold all the units, and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> was thrilled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We ended up making some money,'' says Chris Westfahl, a former Lehman managing director who oversaw the deal, sounding as if he still couldn't believe that it had happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Radow's long association with Lehman has its downside. He says he may be deposed by SunCal, a major land acquisition company in Irvine, Calif., in Lehman's bankruptcy proceeding. SunCal accuses Lehman, which lent it more than $2 billion, of trying to ''usurp'' its property in a ''self-serving scheme.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does Radco have to do with any of this? Lehman, which disputes the accusations, brought it in to settle up with some SunCal creditors as part of a workout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Welcome to my world,'' Mr. Radow shrugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, he says, he found himself in a room full of angry homeowners at the Met Warner Center a condominium project in Woodland Hills, Calif., which he has been managing for a <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> private equity fund. Mr. Radow said there was one guy who wouldn't stop badgering him about, well, something. It might have been the rule forbidding residents from installing their own air-conditioners. Or he might have been protesting the Met's outdoor smoking ban.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was one of those three-hour meetings that tested your bladder,'' says Marty Golden, a board member of the condominium owners association there. ''This guy just wouldn't let up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, Mr. Radow grabbed a chair and pushed it into the center of the room. ''The answer is no,'' he remembers telling his adversary. ''It's not going to change. But it seems as though you've got a lot more to say.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Radow said he then sat down and loosened his tie. ''I've got all night,'' he warned.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MUCH has been said about buyers at glassy new condominiums who signed contracts when the sun was shining on the market but demanded their deposits back when the weather turned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many filed applications with the state attorney general's office to get their refunds back, or filed lawsuits. Now a developer of a new condominium in SoHo is declaring victory over reluctant buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo project, on West Broadway near Canal Street, went on the market in 2007. It was named SoHo Mews to evoke its fashionable neighborhood, and Charles Gwathmey was commissioned to design its two buildings, with large windows, connected by a landscaped interior courtyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were even raised 5 percent soon after the building went on the market, with a top listed price of $11.6 million, or $3,300 per square foot, for a four-bedroom penthouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak, 31 of the 68 apartments were in contract. But some buyers were hit hard in the financial crisis. Some lost their jobs, while others got cold feet and changed their minds. Seven filed complaints with the attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, asking for their money back. Now that the building is finished, property records show only 15 apartments have closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after a series of rulings handed down by the attorney general's office in the last few weeks, the developer, Albert Laboz, a principal of United American Land, said his company had prevailed in all claims decided to date. One of the seven claims was dropped by a buyer, who decided to settle, and another was not decided because it raised a question about federal law. Others went in favor of United American Land, and the escrow agent holding the deposits turned them over to the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In heavily redacted copies of the decision Mr. Laboz provided, the buyers and their lawyers raised questions about the accuracy of the condominium documents, including an error in a description of the property, and allegations of misrepresentations by the sponsor about the closing dates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rulings found that the error in the land description was insignificant. Any promises that may or may not have been made about closing dates were also deemed insignificant, unless they were made in the offering plan or in the contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attorney general's office did not respond to a request for copies of the rulings by late last week, though it did not challenge Mr. Laboz's contention that his company had prevailed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several lawyers for buyers who are suing to get out of condo contracts in New York City, but not in the SoHo Mews, said they did not believe the rulings set a precedent for other claims still pending before the attorney general's office. They said many of those other claims involved serious errors in offering plans, including ones that should have forced developers to offer all buyers a chance to rescind their contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But John D'Agostino, a lawyer who represents SoHo Mews, called the decisions a turning point. ''The attorney general is starting to realize that some of the arguments being made have no merit,'' he said. ''They were getting bogged down in something they never should have been involved in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Laboz, he said that sales began to pick up after prices were cut 15 percent in September. So far, two of the buyers who complained to the attorney general have agreed to close, he said, and settlement talks with others are under way.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PITY the long-suffering brokers of luxury Manhattan real estate. They endured a lonely spell, waiting for the phone to ring. Few properties sold and few buyers were even looking. Now with the Wall Street bonus season about to begin, they are suffering again, they say, but this time because of a drought in inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a bump-up in sales over the last few months, brokers say, more wealthy buyers have come back to the table, looking for fabulous apartments at a bargain. But there are precious few listings. ''I have clients who feel this is the time to buy,'' said Felise Gross, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens, ''but there is very little prime property to show them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing drought, they say, is most pronounced in large condominiums in the most celebrated new buildings, but also significant in the town house market. And even in the luxury co-op market, where there are more listings, only a fraction have been priced competitively enough to attract buyers, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Thomas P. DiNapoli, the New York State comptroller, gave brokers cheer in a report suggesting that Wall Street had begun to rebound faster than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report said total compensation at the six largest banks could exceed the $163.9 billion that was paid in 2007, before the financial crisis. But some Wall Street segments like hedge funds are still weaker than before, and the securities industry is down 28,300 jobs in the city (though the number of jobs rose slightly in September). State budget officials are predicting a 22 percent decline in total cash bonuses across New York State, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, with employment down, a smaller number of Wall Streeters could be dividing up a larger bonus pool, though some of it will be in deferred earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These buyers are joining a market already crowded with wealthy foreigners looking to take advantage of the weak dollar, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robby Browne, a Corcoran broker, said he had several wealthy clients seeking trophy properties but had nothing to show them that was ''good to buy.'' He noted that a town house at 92 Charles Street, owned by Armon Bar-Tur, a founder of SafeHarbor Capital Partners, a real estate investment firm, went into contract less than two weeks after it was listed late last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When sales first began to pick up over the summer, brokers say, some of the best-priced listings were sold; they have not been replaced by a new supply of similar listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who might have been self-conscious about buying luxury apartments in the midst of the recession are now back in the market, said Kirk Henckels, the director of Stribling Private Brokerage. ''Now when you can say you bought it at a third off of its previous value, it is not quite so embarrassing,'' he said. ''You look smart.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere is the luxury drought more apparent than at 15 Central Park West, the new condo at West 62nd Street, which not long ago had a listing for $80 million. That unit, a 5,200-square-foot four-bedroom, finally sold in September for $37 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A three-bedroom owned by Beny Alagem, the founder of Packard Bell Electronics, was listed for $24 million and sold at the end of September for $19.9 million. An apartment listed for $15.5 million is now in contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now only 11 smaller apartments are on the market, with asking prices ranging from $3.2 million to $13.9 million. At the recent sales rate, that would amount to a three or four months' supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer of Mr. Alagem's unit, Stuart Peterson, an investor in <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> before it was sold to <span class="companylink">Google</span>, also wanted a staff apartment. So, property records show, he paid $1.625 million for a 463-square-foot studio in the building, which works out to $3,510 a square foot. That comes close to matching the original sale prices for some smaller one-bedrooms facing Broadway rather than Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arthur Zeckendorf, who developed the property with his brother, William Lie Zeckendorf, said they had decided to sell one of their own two staff apartments because ''they approached us.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS   </div><div>2661 words</div><div>22 November 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORKERS get to feel smug about a lot of things. We have great food, arts and culture, the Yankees. We can also feel good about our relatively low use of energy, thanks to public transportation and our small living spaces. But sometimes -- sometimes -- we fail to notice where there's room for improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty-nine percent of New York City's greenhouse gases come from residential buildings. And there are New Yorkers who have looked hard at their homes, in buildings of all ages and sizes, and found ways to make them more energy efficient. Others are watching their operating costs rise (along with global temperatures), and want to know what to do about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With new developments, it's easy,'' says Marc Zuluaga, a senior engineer at Steven Winter Associates, a consulting firm that works on energy issues. ''But in almost any building, there are low-hanging opportunities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every building is different, and predicting the return on an investment in efficiency can be tricky. Older buildings are not necessarily bigger energy hogs than their newer neighbors, and some buildings that went up in the last 10 years should be ashamed. But the size and age of a structure can tell an expert where to start looking for savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to start with conservation,'' Mr. Zuluaga said. ''Once you squeeze every last ounce of efficiency out of a building -- until you can't make it more efficient without knocking it down and building a new one -- then it makes sense to add solar.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find out where energy savings might be found in your building, an energy audit is in order. These are available from private consultants or utility companies like <span class="companylink">Con Edison</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good place to begin is to make sure that all systems are working as efficiently as they can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you have the right thermostat in place but the temperature sensor is in the wrong place, that can have a huge impact on energy performance,'' said Jeffrey Perlman, the president of Bright Power, an energy consulting group. ''But it doesn't cost a lot to fix.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From there, you can get more ambitious: you can try to balance the temperature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Generally, buildings are heated to the tenant who's complaining the most because they're cold,'' Mr. Perlman said. ''To be more energy-efficient, you want the whole building to get to be roughly the same temperature at roughly the same time. A well-balanced system can work wonders. And it can save money as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Mr. Perlman worked with Carl Wallman, who owns a 19-unit rental building on East 70th Street in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For years,'' Mr. Wallman said, ''it really got me to see windows open in the building and the heat blasting away. Surely, I'm interested in the savings, but really having the building run more energy efficiently was important.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Perlman's team made some small fixes, like adjusting the controls on the boiler and installing a new thermostat for the ground floor, which had its own heating system and was always cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 2007-8 heating season, the building used 11 percent less energy than it had the previous year, before the changes. Mr. Wallman spent almost $19,000 on energy bills for all of 2007; if the tweaks had been in place then, he would have saved about $2,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are small buildings,'' Mr. Wallman said, ''so the savings are not going to be in the tens of thousands.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he pointed out, New York is home to thousands of small buildings. ''These little buildings are going to make a big difference.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Perlman charged about $1,500 for the initial energy audit, $1,200 for boiler upgrades and $500 annually for continuing monitoring and maintenance. And with savings of just over $2,000 a year, the project should pay for itself in less than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An enormous amount of energy is spent heating buildings, and an enormous amount is wasted when someone throws open a window to cool off a boiling apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another way to bring building temperatures under control is to regulate the heat in individual rooms. A gadget called a thermostatic radiator valve attaches to some steam and hot-water radiators and automatically senses the temperature of the room. If it gets too toasty, the valve clamps down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These valves were installed in a 102-unit co-op building on Fourth Street in the East Village about 10 years ago with the help of Henry Gifford, an energy consultant in New York City. The co-op's yearly consumption of oil has decreased by 15 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think it was so much an energy conservation thing at that time,'' said Tom Ostrowski, the president of the co-op board. ''It wasn't quite in vogue at that point. But it was just a more efficient way to do it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the years since, however, Mr. Ostrowski's co-op has looked into a solar hot water system and batted around the idea of replacing all the windows and insulating the building. All of these options were deemed too expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, for now, the co-op is replacing windows with more efficient models one by one, and it has a plan in place to install motion-sensing lights in interior stairwells and trash rooms. But at the moment, No. 1 on the agenda is to finish repair work on the building facade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I was an individual homeowner, I could say, 'I don't care if I make my money back on solar panels,' '' Mr. Ostrowski said. ''But I can't. I can't say, 'Hey, one hundred other people! Follow my dream!' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other buildings have had more success getting larger projects under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Winston Churchill, a large postwar co-op at 2500 Johnson Avenue in Riverdale in the Bronx, is making 12 upgrades, including adjustments to the air-conditioning system, ventilation improvements and new lighting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To cover the cost, the building secured a $1.695 million loan, and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority brought down the interest rate from 6.5 percent to zero percent with a payment of $336,122 to the lender. This program, the Multifamily Performance Program, is not currently accepting new applications while it re-examines the criterion used to evaluate projects. The authority says it will resume the program but does not have a target date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had been working under the assumption that the energy savings would be such that the loan could be paid back by those savings,'' said Steven M. Hochberg, the board president. ''It looks like that is, in fact, going to be the case.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the building has completed 5 of the 12 planned upgrades. It has, for example, switched to natural gas from No. 6 oil, an extraordinarily dirty fuel. ''It's like the garbage of oil,'' said Mark Singh, the building superintendent at the Winston Churchill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The co-op has also installed a new mechanism for making hot water, separating that system from the one that generates energy to heat the air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mark would have to run his large boilers all summer long to make hot water for the building,'' said Michael Scorrano, the managing director of the En-Power Group, which is overseeing the project for the co-op. ''It's just way oversized for what you need.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These new systems were installed this summer, so the building has yet to go through a full heating season. But Mr. Scorrano estimates that in the summer the building will experience a 50 percent reduction in fuel use, which had cost about $700,000 per year. In the winter, he expects that reduction will be closer to 15 percent. The cost of the new hot water system for the 333-unit building was $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You read a lot of articles on saving the environment,'' Mr. Hochberg said. ''But most people are only going to save the environment if they can save some money in the process. And it seems to have come together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some people, however, making their homes as green as can be is a goal in itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Vernon is the president of a 112-unit co-op in Inwood called Nagle Apartments that has tried hard to become more environmentally responsible. The residents of the three-building complex started simply about five years ago by upgrading the lighting with motion sensors and more efficient bulbs. Then they moved on to larger projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our goal,'' Mr. Vernon said, ''was to do green projects that made fiscal sense.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost all of the windows were replaced and new radiator valves were installed, at a cost of about $860,000. To cover the costs of these and other upgrades, the building took out a two-part loan and the development authority brought down the interest, leaving the residents with an average rate of 4.31 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through a combination of selling apartments that the co-op owned, interest on investments (it owns some Treasury bonds), and energy savings, the improvements were made without an assessment or maintenance increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, the building's boiler spends a great deal of time resting comfortably on the lowest setting, and gas consumption has decreased by around 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the building is looking into putting in a green roof -- layers of plantings and soil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green roofs keep the top of a building cool and provide a layer of insulation. They also retain rainwater, which can help keep the city's sewer system from being overwhelmed in a heavy rain. But some consultants say that you'll get more bang for your buck keeping the roof cool with white or silver paint and that a building will be better insulated with traditional materials like fiberglass. Green roofs are, however, much nicer to look at -- and hang out on -- than the alternative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another initiative that the co-op is undertaking is environmentally friendly renovations. As rental apartments become vacant, the co-op makes them over for sale. It uses recycled materials where possible, installs energy-efficient appliances and decorates with low- or nontoxic paints and finishes. One of these apartments, a 900-square-foot two-bedroom, is on the market for $359,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales agent, Matthew Bizzarro of Stein-Perry Real Estate, who also lives in the building, says that he has priced it a bit higher than comparable apartments in the area. Traffic has been good, he says, and has included people who say the green factor appealed to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some energy consultants are skeptical of renovations that focus on using recycled materials rather than the best materials for long-term energy savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's always good to use paints that are low in volatile organic compounds,'' Mr. Zuluaga of Steven Winter Associates said. ''Where I do sort of take issue with those types of projects is when the focus is on recycling rather than using materials to make a better building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point, it's hard to say whether people will pay a premium for a home that's been retrofitted to be green.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think over time there will be a modest premium associated with this because of the lower operating costs,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal group Miller Samuel. ''But right now the reason it's hard to discern whether there's a premium is because it's usually one component of an extensive renovation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisa Detwiler, a broker at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, has a listing for a property that matches that description: a town house in Brooklyn Heights. The owner, Doug Mcdonald, gutted it and then put it back together with energy-efficiency in mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house is on the market for $5.95 million, a lot of money for a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights. But Mr. Mcdonald says that he is confident his home will command a premium, in part because he has been able to charge $4,000 a month for its two-bedroom garden apartment, more than comparable places in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he got that price because tenants liked the idea of living in a place that is well insulated and low in volatile organic compounds, chemicals commonly found in paints and finishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout the brownstone, the lights, windows and electrical system are all designed to conserve as much energy as possible. The materials used in construction were recycled wherever possible, and the roof is painted white to keep it cool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house is also wired for solar power, but Mr. Mcdonald said that while he expected the price of solar panels to come down soon, the economics did not yet make sense to him. And before you worry about making your own energy, he added, you have to be sure you're wasting as little as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the biggest energy savers in the town house involve temperature. Each floor of the five-story house has its own heating and cooling system, so only the areas that need adjustment get a blast of warm or cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The insulation is also an energy-saver. Mr. Mcdonald used a spray-on foam called <span class="companylink">Icynene</span> and a fluffy blue material made from recycled denim called Bonded Logic, and says he usually heats just the bottom floor and lets the warm air rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The electric bill for four stories of the five-story brownstone averages $183 per month -- the rental unit is metered separately. And the gas bill, which includes heat and hot water, averages out to $83 per month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Waste reduction should be part of the purpose of good design,'' Mr. Mcdonald said. ''It's like in golf: you don't want to waste any energy at all. It's a long sport, and anything you waste ends up coming back and working against you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because You Can't Knit the Building a Sweater</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making an old building more efficient can be a daunting prospect. Here are a few tips:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One place to find energy savings is to avoid venting out more air than necessary -- the boiler will just have to work extra hard to replace the temperate air. A leaky elevator shaft, for example, can act as a chimney, sucking warm air up and out of the building. And in many postwar buildings, ventilation and exhaust fans suck more air out of the building than necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An important part of long-term conservation is using equipment properly. The Thomas Shortman Training Fund, the arm of a building workers' union that provides classes to its members, offers a 40-hour class for superintendents on energy-efficient building management (www.1000supers.com[http://www.1000supers.com]).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simple, inexpensive adjustments to consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low-flow shower heads and faucet aerators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Motion-sensor light switches and efficient bulbs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GUILFORD -- THE ''big house'' phenomenon that has for at least a decade roiled neighborhoods the length of the Fairfield County shoreline is now stirring up towns to the east, including this coastal community near New Haven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shoehorning of supersize houses into neighborhoods conceived as summer cottage communities has been a source of controversy for several years. Lately, however, a proposal to rein in the trend has proved even more contentious. Perplexed officials say they're coming to the conclusion that while property owners typically like the idea of restricting the size of neighbors' houses, they often balk when it comes down to adopting zoning changes that might limit their own options as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighborhood associations along the Guilford shoreline have reacted with alarm to proposed zoning changes intended to forestall the building of out-of-scale houses among modest Capes and colonials. In the Mulberry Point neighborhood, for example, a letter recently distributed to residents warned that, with the new zoning in place, ''the attractiveness of our area, our property values, and tax basis may change to our detriment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reaction has town officials and volunteers who worked on the proposal scratching their heads. ''We thought people were saying they were concerned with buildings being out of scale with the rest of the neighborhood,'' said George Kral, the town planner. ''However, it seems that within these communities, there's no uniformity of mind on this subject.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation is familiar to planners in Fairfield County. ''We ran a number of proposals up the flagpole,'' said James Wendt, the assistant planning director in Fairfield, where big houses rapidly began replacing ranches and Capes in beach neighborhoods about seven years ago. All were rejected except a reduction in maximum height, from 40 feet to 32 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, Westport's planning commission has twice considered tighter size standards, only to back away from the proposals after heated debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Guilford, talk of size restrictions began two years ago after a commission working to update the town's coastal management plan met with representatives of shore neighborhoods to hear their concerns. Not all participants described oversize houses as a problem, said John Henningson, the commission's chairman, ''but certainly there was a consensus.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of tear-down-and-build-up activity in Guilford has been slower than in Fairfield County. But because plots along Long Island Sound tend to be small -- about 10,000 square feet -- even a few massive houses can have a significant impact on a neighborhood, Mr. Kral said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One prominent example is a 9,000-square-foot stone-and-shingle house that replaced several smaller buildings on property fronting the Sound at Andrews Point. The house sold last year for $11.9 million, according to Karen Stephens, the owner of Page Taft GMAC Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald Knapp, who owns two homes in Mulberry Point, one of which he rents to academics, said he had spoken out in the past when he felt new houses going up in the neighborhood were ''inordinate in size.'' Nevertheless, he is dead set against using zoning as a tool for further restricting size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are undue restrictions on what I could do or what my neighbors could do that weren't there before and don't apply to the rest of the town,'' Mr. Knapp said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They do apply in one place: The exclusive shore community of Sachem's Head, which has its own taxing and zoning authority, adopted restrictions seven years ago on lot coverage and floor area much like those proposed. Contrary to the suggestions in the Mulberry Point letter, the standards have not harmed property values, which rose an average 60 percent from 2002 to 2007, said Mr. Henningson, who lives there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What many residents don't understand, said Elizabeth Kozarec, an architect who consulted on the proposed changes, is that the new standards would still allow for large houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kozarec offered as an example a 19,600-square-foot lot that now has a 2,276-square-foot house on it. Current zoning would allow for a maximum house size of 5,888 square feet, she said. The new regulations would scale back the maximum to 4,038.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not drastic,'' she said. ''It's a subtle stepping down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, she added, owners of less than 10,000 square feet of property would actually benefit from the new regulations, which grant more leeway for smaller lots than current rules do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town will hold its third public hearing on the matter on Monday. The outcome will no doubt be of interest in neighboring Madison, to the east. A subcommittee there, working on new size standards for shore neighborhoods, plans to present its own proposal next month, according to Marilyn Ozols, Madison's planning and zoning administrator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenn Chalder, the president of Planimetrics, a consulting firm in Avon, said it is important for communities to revise their zoning if they are to maintain some control over how their towns look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers, he pointed out, have other priorities. ''I've never met a developer who isn't trying to get the most floor area out of his house,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, Mr. Chalder added, it's possible that the big-house trend has run its course. Having taken rise in the 1980s, ''living large may go the way of big hair -- we just don't know.''</p>

</p><div>LIVING IN ASTORIA, QUEENS</div>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF one wanted to encapsulate everything that defines Queens into a single neighborhood -- and who wouldn't, really -- the result might very well be Astoria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ensconced in the northwest corner of the borough and bigger than some small towns, it used to be dominated by immigrants from southern Europe but has morphed into a broader mix. The message to every newcomer couldn't be clearer: the united nations of Astoria welcomes you, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having something for everyone is admittedly a cliche, but even if used sparingly it should apply to Astoria. The neighborhood has rentals galore, row houses and co-ops, new condominiums and a few Victorian houses; its waterfront is part beautiful parkland, part industry; there are subway stations both elevated and subterranean, along with a bridge to Manhattan; and, of course, there's close to every kind of food that civilization has put forth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even taking into account Astoria's proximity to Midtown Manhattan and its growing popularity, it is less expensive to live there than you might think. Several new condos have entered the market, with many recently opening their doors and offering tax abatements. (A few other buildings have become ''luxury rentals.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combined with the already large housing stock in the area, they add up to lots of choice and a mix of prices that will be refreshing to many.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astoria's appeal has become clear to George Hrisikopoulos, 32, a real estate lawyer and a resident for two years. His friends in Manhattan ''are asking me if I know of any apartments,'' he said. ''That never happened before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing up in Whitestone, Mr. Hrisikopoulos recalled, he typically did his hanging out in Astoria, so when he made his move in April 2007, he was prepared. He spent $790,000 on a two-family house on 42nd Street; it is also home to his law office and a rental tenant. He marvels at the ever-growing diversity of the neighborhood, combined with the steady march of Manhattanites onto its lively avenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Astoria is on the map now, like all of a sudden,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astoria borders Long Island City at 36th Avenue and stretches from the East River to 49th Street, which marks the start, as the community board points out, of the Woodside Houses, a public development. (The debate over borders may never be settled, but the area is roughly 3.5 square miles.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly every east-west avenue in Astoria has managed to sprout a commercial strip of some kind, like the still-vibrant Greek presence on 31st Street and the growing Brazilian district on 34th Avenue. The diversity is such that outsiders will often encounter storefronts seen in few other places, like the Pan-Lemnian Philanthropic Association on 30th Avenue or the Fraternal Society of Castrofilippo on Ditmars Boulevard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest shopping, eating and lounging opportunities are on Steinway Street and Ditmars Boulevard, where each block seems to host a family business from a different country. National chains, with the exception of ubiquitous Dunkin' Donuts franchises, are mostly crowded out by local ones, like Bakeway cafe and Trade Fair supermarkets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around many an Astoria corner, one can usually find a typical stock of Queens town houses and semidetached row houses in red or brown brick. But the oldest section of the neighborhood, around 12th Street and 27th Avenue, still has a few mid-19th-century houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the north-south streets and on some avenues, the city's condo boom is in full swing, spurred by a recently ended program that offered tax abatements to new properties. The lack of historic districts or restrictive zoning in Astoria, population around 145,000, has permitted numerous teardowns of two-family homes in exchange for taller condo buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More projects are on the way, like the Lincoln Equities Group's planned Halletts Pointdevelopment, which could bring seven apartment towers and 2,400 residential units to Astoria's waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there may be fewer new condo towers after that. By the end of 2009, said Lucille Hartman, the district manager of Community Board 1, rezoning is expected to be approved, limiting the scale permitted in new local developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the talk of condos, Astoria is still a house-dominated neighborhood, and prices are down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Odysseas Odysseos, a broker at Century 21 Tri-Boro Terrace Realty who has worked in the neighborhood for 17 years, prices peaked in 2007, ''and after that everything started going downward.'' Now, he said, ''we are seeing about a 10 to 15 percent reduction in prices, in that ballpark.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of the market, Mr. Odysseos sold a house for $1.25 million, though homes now rarely sell for more than $1 million, with prices typically starting around $650,000 for those in need of renovation. Another factor, for houses near the water, is distance from the subway; the walk to the N and W trains can take 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With abatements offered at some new condos, property tax bills can provide reverse sticker shock, said Steve Figueroa, an agent at Bond New York. For a one-bedroom, Mr. Figueroa said, taxes can be as low as $7 a month, $100 or more for nonabated properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market is actually doing pretty well,'' Mr. Figueroa said. ''There are a lot of buyers wanting to buy the properties and flip them as rental properties. We've been getting cash offers on a lot of units, 20 to 30 percent down. We're getting a lot more people from the city.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average new building runs $550 to $650 per square foot, said Robson Lemos, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. That's down about 20 percent from 2007, Mr. Lemos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Ria Lofts, a new property on 31st Avenue listed on aptsandlofts.com, one-bedroom condominiums range from $375,000 to $530,000. On Vernon Boulevard, the Sohmer Piano factory has been converted into 69 loft condos, with remaining units listed by Prudential Douglas Elliman ranging from $635,000 for a two-bedroom two-bath unit to $955,000 for a three-bedroom three-bath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With condo developments continuing to enter the market, the overall effect has been something of a slowdown, said Charles Sciberras, an agent at Realty Executives Today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I started doing condo projects in Astoria in 2006,'' Mr. Sciberras said, ''they would be gone within 90 days, everything. In 2008, it would take maybe five months.'' Now, it's slower, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rentals remain abundant. In new construction, Mr. Figueroa of Bond said, one-bedrooms begin at $1,600 a month, two-bedrooms at $2,200. Older units start around $1,100 for one-bedrooms, and $1,500 for two-bedrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among neighborhoods outside Manhattan, Astorians enjoy one of the quicker commutes, with multiple stops on the N and W trains along the elevated tracks above 31st Street, and a few more on the R and V lines on Broadway at Steinway and 46th Streets. With luck and the good graces of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the trip from the southern part of the neighborhood can take 15 minutes or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astoria's allotment of parkland includes both the eclectic Socrates Sculpture Park on Vernon Boulevard and the wide waterfront expanse of Astoria Park, which has a giant Robert Moses-era pool and two big bridges looming overhead. Heading inland, Astorians catch films at the Kaufman Astoria Studios movie theater on 36th Street and learn their entertainment history at the Museum of the Moving Image on 35th Avenue. Sated with recreation and entertainment, locals need only spin a globe to pick a cuisine for dinner; Astoria most likely has it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Students don't have to walk far to get to class, as the number of public schools is in the double digits. At the Baccalaureate School for Global Education, a selective public middle and high school that prepares students for the International Baccalaureate exam, SAT averages last year were 532 in reading, 567 in math and 541 in writing, versus 435, 459 and 432 citywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Public School 84 on 41st Street, known as the Steinway School, 92.3 percent of students met standards last year in math and 77.4 percent in English. At Intermediate School 141 on 21st Avenue, 80.1 percent of students met state standards in English, 91.3 percent in math.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1830s, Stephen Halsey, a fur trader, named his new neighborhood across the East River after a friend and fellow trader, John Jacob Astor. Because of the ferry service that Mr. Halsey started, the village slowly grew; mansions went up around 12th Street, some of which remain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Steinway family opened a piano factory and, starting in the 1870s, it had a bustling community of workers. The plant inspired the name of a busy local street (and, later, a subway station). A housing boom in the early 20th century brought in the broad ethnic mix for which Astoria is known.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONDOMINIUM buyers in the New York area often paid little mind to Federal Housing Administration mortgages, either because these government-backed loans had relatively low dollar limits or because federal rules put them beyond the reach of most condo associations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last year, the federal government raised the maximum F.H.A. loan amount to $729,750 from $362,790 for high-cost areas like Manhattan and northern New Jersey. It recently extended that ceiling through 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, earlier this month, the agency said that through next January it would relax some rules under which condo owners can qualify for the loans. (The F.H.A. still does not make loans on co-ops, and mortgage executives say they don't expect that policy to change anytime soon.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry executives say the F.H.A.'s new rules will open an important lending option to condo buyers, especially those with weak credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This will absolutely be a big help for condo buyers,'' said Melissa Cohn, the president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company. ''The loans are still more costly for people, but it will at least allow them to gain entry into condos, and they can always refinance into more traditional, better-priced loans.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">F.H.A. loans have grown in popularity since the collapse of the mortgage market in 2007, because borrowers need not maintain stellar credit scores or save up for large down payments to qualify. Borrowers with credit scores as low as 600 can often qualify, and they can secure a mortgage with a down payment of less than 5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downside, though, is that borrowers must pay an F.H.A. insurance premium, similar to private mortgage insurance. On a $300,000 mortgage, that could add nearly $150 to the monthly payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the old F.H.A. rules, a borrower couldn't qualify for a loan unless the condominium development had been approved by the housing administration, a process that could take months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cohn said many condominium associations in New York City declined even to try, because the agency barred ''right of first refusal'' clauses, which many associations include in their ownership agreements. Such language grants the association the right to buy a unit at the price listed by the unit's owner. That restriction has now been dropped by the housing administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has also streamlined the process for lenders that want to qualify a condominium for the F.H.A. program. Lenders can now approve condos without applying to the government, if they believe the condominium complies with F.H.A. lending policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.H.A. will permit these ''spot approvals'' until Jan. 31, 2010, but lenders say they are hopeful the government will extend the policy beyond that date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian J. Chappelle, a partner with Potomac Partners, a mortgage industry consultant in Washington, says some lenders are uncomfortable with determining whether a condominium project meets F.H.A. eligibility requirements. ''If they make a mistake, they're responsible,'' and could face F.H.A. sanctions, he said. ''So I'm not sure how many will take advantage of this at the start.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government also relaxed rules that had limited the number of condominiums that would qualify for F.H.A. loans. Under the old rules, if more than 50 percent of a new development was unsold, the F.H.A. would deny a loan. Now, just 30 percent of a development must be sold before an F.H.A. borrower can qualify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the old rules capped, at 30 percent, the share of condos that could have F.H.A. loans in a given development. Now the figure is 50 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard L. Tracy Jr., the chief executive of Campbell Mortgage in West Haven, Conn., and an F.H.A.-approved lender, said the various changes could increase his loan volume by 10 percent or more. ''F.H.A. realizes this is one thing they can do to keep the real estate market going,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- In January, Mike Rowland was so broke that he had to raid his retirement savings to move here from Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week ago, he and a couple of buddies bought a two-unit apartment building for nearly a million dollars. They had only a little cash to bring to the table but, with the federal government insuring the transaction, a large down payment was not necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was kind of crazy we could get this big a loan,'' said Mr. Rowland, 27. ''If a government official came out here, I would slap him a high-five.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its efforts to prop up a shattered housing market, the government is greatly extending its traditional support of real estate, including guaranteeing the mortgages of middle-class and even upper-class buyers against default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, the government did not insure a single mortgage in this city, one of the most expensive in the country. Buyers here, as well as in Manhattan, Santa Monica and every other wealthy area, were presumed to be able to handle the steep prices and correspondingly hefty down payments on their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the government is guaranteeing an average of six mortgages a week here. Real estate agents say the insurance is such a good deal that there will soon be many more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy changes like the shift in insurance, while often introduced on a temporary basis, are becoming so popular that they could prove difficult to undo. With government finances already under great strain, the policy expansions are creating new risks for American taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Internal Revenue Service is giving tax rebates to first-time buyers, and soon to move-up buyers, in a program beset by accusations of fraud. And the government agency that issues mortgage insurance, the Federal Housing Administration, is underwriting loans at quadruple the rate of three years ago even as its reserves to cover defaults are dwindling. On Thursday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said more than one in six F.H.A. borrowers was behind on payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">F.H.A. insurance was created for minority and low-income families who could not come up with the traditional down payment of 20 percent required by private lenders. Buyers receive loans from government-approved lenders and are required to document their income and assets. They must pay a substantial insurance premium of 1.75 percent of the loan. But in return, their down payment can be as low as 3.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, most F.H.A. loans were in low-cost states like Texas and Michigan. Under the agency's loan limits, houses along the coasts were usually too expensive to qualify. In 2007, fewer than 4,400 F.H.A. loans were made in California, according to the research firm MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, and none were in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 helped change that by temporarily doubling the maximum loan the F.H.A. insured, to $729,750. A two-unit property like the one bought by Mr. Rowland and his friends can be insured for up to $934,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''F.H.A. financing was a lost language in San Francisco, the real estate equivalent of Aramaic,'' said Michael Ackerman, the agent who represented Mr. Rowland and his friends. ''Once the limits were raised, smart buyers started calling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.H.A. has insured more than 107,000 loans so far this year in the state, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, about 270 of them in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominium buildings approved for F.H.A. financing -- a relative handful -- trumpet the news on their Web sites. The Soma Grand, a new 246-unit building downtown where one-bedrooms cost in excess of $500,000, received F.H.A. certification early in the summer. A half-dozen buyers since then used F.H.A. insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Guarantee Mortgage Corporation, which has 150 mortgage brokers in the Bay Area, Seattle and Portland, Ore., F.H.A. loans have grown to about 15 percent of its business, from less than 3 percent a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It sure has helped us put a lot of deals together,'' said Guarantee's chief sales officer, Bob Siefert. He predicts that a quarter of Guarantee's deals will soon be guaranteed by the F.H.A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some F.H.A. borrowers here say they have the cash for a full down payment but would rather invest it in the stock market or use it for remodeling. Others, like Mr. Rowland and his friends, simply do not have the money required by private lenders -- which would have been nearly $200,000, in their case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were resigned to waiting another year,'' said a second partner, Michael Bedar, 31. ''Then we read about the F.H.A. I had never heard of it before, and couldn't quite believe it. But it was the answer to our problems.'' They put down about $33,000, split among the three of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the F.H.A. is certainly strengthening the high-end market in the Bay Area by prompting more sales, there are growing concerns that it might become a destabilizing force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth Donohue, inspector general for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the parent agency of the F.H.A., said the higher loan limits were increasing the potential risk to the F.H.A. Last week, the agency said its cash reserves had fallen below their Congressionally mandated minimum because of the large volume of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If one of these higher-limit loans fail, that's equivalent to two or three cheaper loans,'' Mr. Donohue said. ''You have to ask yourself, was the F.H.A. ever intended to address these markets?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sees another risk: larger loans will be a greater draw for those who want to commit fraud. That would exacerbate a problem already besetting the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some San Francisco agents who are doing F.H.A. deals worry about the long-term consequences. Real estate commissions are 6 percent. If the value of a property were to hold steady, a seller who put down the F.H.A. minimum would suffer a loss after fees. And while the Bay Area has traditionally been an excellent investment, the last few years have proved a big exception.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Is this going to be the next wave of the housing downturn?'' asked Eileen Bermingham, an agent with Pacific Union. ''With such a minimal down payment, how do we make sure people don't get in over their heads?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.H.A. commissioner, David H. Stevens, said recently that its loans were relatively safe because the buyer was required to live in the property. They ''are for shelter. They aren't speculative-type investments,'' Mr. Stevens said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the idea of a house as an investment dies hard. Mr. Bedar, Mr. Rowland and the third partner in their property, Jordan Kurland, are all in the technology field, but their dreams of wealth do not feature stock options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're banking on real estate,'' said Mr. Kurland, 24. ''Everyone expects prices to keep going up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kurland and Mr. Bedar, who are employed full time, are the buyers of record. Mr. Rowland, a freelancer, will have his interests protected by a legal agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their building, for which they paid $963,000, is on a quiet street in the up-and-coming Hayes Valley neighborhood, close to fashionable restaurants they have already been trying out. The friends plan to live in the bottom unit and rent out the top. Thanks to rock-bottom interest rates, none of them will pay much more than a thousand dollars a month. ''Everyone should have the chance to do this,'' Mr. Kurland said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone may get a chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks ago, Congress extended the higher lending limits for another year. Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in an interview that he planned to introduce legislation next year raising the maximum F.H.A. loan by $100,000, to $839,750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His bill would make the new limits permanent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For at least two years before a fire killed three men in an illegally divided house next door, Diane Ross and her family lived in an illegal apartment at 42-38 65th Street in Woodside, Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their life there -- in a basement divided into one apartment and four single-room units, with six others upstairs, all crammed into a two-family house -- seemed to them to be business as usual, and attracted no special notice. Neither the tenants nor their landlord, who said he charged $107 a month for each room, tried to hide it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Con Edison</span> workers entered the house in 2007 to make repairs. The city taxed the house as a three-family home, even though it was built for two. And the Ross family and their landlord say that city agencies visited their apartment and helped pay their rent for about two years -- until Nov. 7, when the fatal blaze swept through the basement next door, killing the three men.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, building inspectors declared Ms. Ross's apartment a hazard and ordered her out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Administration for Children's Services and the Human Resources Administration, which provide rent assistance in various situations, said they could not reveal whether they had supported Ms. Ross's family, citing confidentiality rules. They said that they checked documents and sometimes visited clients' homes, but that they did not function as building inspectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the story of 65th Street illustrates a problem often cited by housing advocates: Dangerous, illegal apartments often exist in plain sight, under the noses of overworked building inspectors whose job is to discover and fine violators, and of neighbors and workers who are not responsible for combating illegal apartments but may see or learn of unsafe situations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing advocates estimate that New York has 100,000 illegal apartments, most of them in Queens. Illegal apartments are so interwoven with the fabric of life in Queens that blatant signs go ignored, according to a 2008 report by the Chhaya Community Development Corporation, a nonprofit immigrant advocacy group. The group looked at 446 houses in two Queens neighborhoods, Briarwood and Jackson Heights, and found that 35 percent appeared to have illegal apartments. Of those, 82 percent had indicators outside, like multiple mailboxes, trash cans and utility wires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent editorial, The Queens Courier called on postal workers to report multiple mail recipients and asked utilities to flag large jumps in water, gas and electricity use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the fire at 42-40 65th Street, the Department of Buildings found that the basement where the men had been trapped had been illegally split into four one-room dwellings, with only one exit, in violation of building codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next door at 42-38, where Ms. Ross lived, inspectors found the five illegal basement units, also with only one exit, and six illegal single-unit dwellings upstairs, said a department spokesman, Tony Sclafani. The department evacuated the basement, leaving Ms. Ross, her son, Donald, and her fiance, Jeffrey Folk, to move into a hotel room subsidized by the Red Cross.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ross, 51, and Mr. Folk, 50, harried as they moved out, said they had thought the apartment was legitimate because an agency they called ''welfare'' was helping to pay the rent. And the man who identified himself as their landlord -- who spoke on the condition that his name not be used, but who said he was related to Claudia Aleman, the owner listed on city property records -- said he had long thought the city had ''approved'' the apartment, because, he said, city agencies knew how it was being used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landlord, to be sure, has an interest in shifting responsibility for the violation. He said multiple city agencies had sent him rent checks for Ms. Ross's family. He read a reporter a letter over the phone from the Administration for Children's Services saying it had supplemented rent for Ms. Ross's son, then 16, from May to August 2007, and that the city had sent a tutor to the apartment twice a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the children's agency assists with rent -- which it does for needy families, sometimes in cases of child abuse or neglect, sometimes to help get a child out of foster care -- caseworkers visit the home to check safety issues, like exposed wires, smoke detectors and window guards, said a spokeswoman, Sharman Stein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Human Resources Administration -- colloquially known as the ''welfare department'' -- sometimes visits sites where it provides rent assistance, primarily to verify that a client lives there, said Barbara Brancaccio, a spokeswoman, adding, ''Just because someone has a relationship with social services at some point doesn't exonerate the landlord from his responsibilities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How obvious the illegal apartments were to visitors is hard to determine. But Mary O'Shaughnessy, who works for an organization that provides emergency services, saw the basement while helping Ms. Ross's family after the fire. She said that any ''prudent New Yorker'' would question its safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just as a reasonable human being going into that space, I would have had questions about it,'' said Ms. O'Shaughnessy, who asked that her agency not be named because it was not responsible for inspecting buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Department of Finance taxed both 42-40 and 42-38 65th Street as three-family homes, an assessment that it said was based on how the properties were used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman, Owen Stone, said that such information is usually gleaned from the owner, the Buildings Department and observers, like neighbors. Being designated a three-family house raises a tax bill only slightly, he said, and tax authorities share their information with the Buildings Department. But a Buildings Department spokesman said tax assessments did not determine whether a house is in compliance with building codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When some wires caught fire in July 2007 outside 42-38, <span class="companylink">Con Edison</span> workers entered to fix a device that delivers electricity to nearby houses; they referred a second call, about wires burning inside the house the next month to the Fire Department. Con Ed is not responsible for enforcing building codes or for repairs inside houses, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 14 houses on the block, nine prompted complaints of suspected illegal apartments over the past two decades, Buildings Department records show. Only two were cited for violations before the fire this month. At the other seven addresses, inspectors either were refused access to the property or entered only after multiple attempts and found no violations, according to records. At 42-40, the house that burned, inspectors investigated complaints in 1990 and 2004 but found no violations, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a July audit by the city comptroller, building inspectors failed 67 percent of the 23,410 times they tried to enter and inspect Queens properties during the year ended June 2008. Inspectors were unable to enter 39 percent of the 8,345 Queens properties they had received complaints about that year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To enter over an owner's objections, inspectors need warrants, which they requested for fewer than 1 percent of the properties that they could not enter, the audit found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few blocks down 65th Street a week after the fire, two houses -- both with a history of illegal-conversion violations and complaints, according to building records -- had signs in the windows advertising rooms for rent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A High &amp; Low listing in the Escapes pages on Friday misstated the number of bedrooms in a house for sale on Mulberry Street in St. Augustine, Fla. It is two, not one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Wed Nov 25 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE'S ''old Florida'' -- and then there's really old Florida. St. Augustine, the oldest permanent European settlement in the continental United States and a city of about 12,500 residents, was settled by the Spanish in 1565.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Matanzas Bay in St. Johns County, south of Jacksonville and north of Daytona Beach, this waterfront city with its 300-year-old homes and Spanish Renaissance Revival architecture attracts tourists and snowbirds. Horse-drawn buggies clop along brick streets. Attractions include the Castillo de San Marcos, a 17th-century fort now a national monument, and St. Augustine Alligator Farm, which is more than 100 years old. The oil tycoon Henry Flagler built a number of grand hotels here, including the Ponce de Leon, built in 1888 and now the centerpiece of Flagler College.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're a city of restorers,'' said Cathy DuPont, the city's public information coordinator. ''Restoration is at the heart of almost everything we do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For second-home buyers, that can mean an opportunity to own a quaint home in a city with 35-foot height restrictions. Housing stock in the center of town includes Mediterranean styles that suggest the Spanish roots of the city, historic buildings that have been converted to condominiums, antique cottages and period Victorians, though there are newer custom homes and stucco midcentury homes as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city draws second-home buyers nationwide, but Virginia, Washington, Atlanta, and central and southern Florida are well represented, and there are increasing numbers of retirees making the city home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in a weaker real estate market, there are over 185 waterfront single-family houses listed for sale at $1 million to $5 million. Most of these are new construction and many of them are large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turn-key, entry-level homes just off the water can be found for about $300,000. And small historic houses, though less commonly on the market, can be had for $250,000 to $500,000. For condominiums with water views and about five minutes' drive from the historic district, prices are about $400,000 to $600,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction slowed unexpectedly in October to the lowest level in six months, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, resurrecting fears that the housing market may be slow to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed that consumer prices inched upward in October, but not enough to make inflation a concern even with the dollar weakening and interest rates at record lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data on home construction showed a decline in the rate of single- and multiple-family home building, contributing to an overall decrease of 10.6 percent in housing starts from September. In total, construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 529,000 housing units in October, falling short of the 600,000 predicted by analysts. Building permits, an indicator of future construction, declined as well, to an annual rate of 552,000, from 575,000, also falling short of forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment construction slowed to a record low, dipping to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 53,000 in October. Analysts attributed the decrease to the reluctance of banks to finance large construction projects and lackluster demand for rentals as vacancies remained abundant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the overall decline in housing construction might be explained by the uncertainty in October over whether Congress would extend a tax credit for first-time home buyers. This month, lawmakers voted to extend the credit through April, but builders might have been reluctant to begin construction in October without assurance that homes would be bought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revival of the housing market is considered crucial to reviving the economy. Construction adds jobs to the economy, and once a home is sold, consumers typically go on spending sprees as they fill it with appliances and furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These figures can be pretty volatile from month to month, so it may just be a blip,'' Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note on Wednesday. ''Nevertheless, taken at face value it suggests home builders are still uncertain about the sustainability of the rebound in home sales.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celia Chen, senior director at Moody'sEconomy.com, said demand for homes would probably remain weak into 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing market is still very fragile,'' she said. ''It seems that the market has bottomed in terms of sales and starts, but that stability can be easily broken, even if affordability is very high.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department's report on consumer prices showed that the Consumer Price Index climbed 0.3 percent, above analysts' estimates of 0.2 percent. The index measures the changes in the cost of a bundle of goods for consumers -- things like cooking oil, airplane tickets and medical care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increases came because of rising energy and motor vehicle costs, the report said. When the government excluded the cost of food and energy, which can be volatile, prices rose 0.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices of cars and trucks showed steep increases. Analysts said that could be a side effect of the government's popular cash-for-clunkers program, which depleted the supply of both cheaper 2009 models and used vehicles, driving up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small increase in consumer prices signaled that inflationary pressures, by and large, appear to be in check, restrained by the nation's high unemployment rate and significant unused factory capacity. On Tuesday, a report on wholesale prices showed similar results, though there were signs that higher prices might be on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Effectively, this gives the Federal Reserve a checkered flag to keep rates exceptionally low for an extended period of time,'' said Brian Bethune, chief United States financial economist for IHS Global Insight.</p>

</div><div class="author">By PETER S. GOODMAN   </div><div>2333 words</div><div>18 November 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA -- Christopher Hall stepped tentatively through the entranceway of City Hall Courtroom 676 and took his place among dozens of others confronting foreclosure purgatory. His hopes all but extinguished, he fully expected the morning to end with a final indignity: He would sign over the deed to his house -- his grandfather's two-story row house; the only house in which he had ever lived; the house where he had raised three children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is devastating,'' he said last month as he sat in the gallery awaiting his hearing. ''This is my childhood home. I grew up there. My mother passed away there. My grandfather passed away there. All of my memories are there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A union roofer, Mr. Hall, 42, had not worked since August 2008, when the contractor that employed him as a foreman went broke and laid off more than 40 people. He had not made a mortgage payment in more than a year, and his lender, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, was threatening to auction off his house through the sheriff's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most American cities, that probably would have been the end of the story: another home turned into distressed bank inventory by the national foreclosure crisis. But in Philadelphia, under a program begun last year to try to keep people in their homes, Mr. Hall entered the courtroom with a reasonable chance of hanging on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the rules adopted by Philadelphia's primary civil court, no owner-occupied house may be foreclosed on and sold by the sheriff's office before a ''conciliation conference,'' a face-to-face meeting between the homeowner and the lender aimed at striking a workable compromise. Every homeowner facing a default filing is furnished with counseling, and sometimes legal representation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, as Mr. Hall stepped into the ornate courtroom just after 9 o'clock, he was swiftly provided with a volunteer lawyer, Kristine A. Phillips. She huddled briefly with a lawyer for <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and returned with a useful promise. The bank would leave him alone for six more weeks while his housing counselor pursued further negotiations in an attempt to lower his payments permanently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You've got more time,'' Ms. Phillips told him. ''We'll get this all worked out,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Thank you so much,'' Mr. Hall said softly, his body shaking with pent-up anxiety now tinged with relief. ''It's a lot of weight off of my shoulders.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a nation confronting a still-gathering crisis of foreclosure, Philadelphia's program has emerged as a model that has enabled hundreds of troubled borrowers to retain their homes. Other cities, from Pittsburgh to Chicago to Louisville, have examined the program and adopted similar efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It brings the mortgage holder and the lender to the table,'' said City Councilor John M. Tobin Jr. of Boston, who is planning to introduce legislation to enact a program in his city modeled on Philadelphia's. ''When people are face to face, it can be pretty disarming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When homeowners in Philadelphia receive legal default notices from their mortgage companies, the court system schedules a conciliation hearing. Canvassers working for local nonprofit agencies visit foreclosed homeowners, distributing fliers that inform them of their rights to a conference, and urging them to call a hot line that can direct them to free housing counselors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can feel a certain sense of relief from their just being able to speak to someone about the program,'' said Anna Hargrove, who works as a canvasser in West Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every Thursday morning, the courtroom on the sixth floor of the regal City Hall here is given over to the conciliation conferences. It fills up with volunteer lawyers in jogging shoes, who are representing homeowners; gray-suited corporate lawyers working for mortgage companies; and all variety of delinquent borrowers -- elderly citizens leaning on canes, construction workers in coveralls, parents with bored children in tow. The lawyers exchange preliminary settlement terms, while the homeowners fill out papers and wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, deals are struck that lower monthly payments for borrowers and allow them to retain their homes. When a homeowner cannot afford the home even at modified terms, the program helps to create a graceful exit, in which the borrower accepts cash for vacating the property or signs over the deed in lieu of further payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those outcomes are similar to the ones produced by the Obama administration's $75 billion program aimed at stemming foreclosures, which gives cash subsidies to mortgage companies as an inducement to accept lower payments. But in Philadelphia there is one crucial difference: the mortgage companies have no choice but to participate. They have to attend the conferences and negotiate in good faith or they cannot proceed with a sheriff's sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the administration's program was begun in March, it has been plagued by complaints of bureaucratic confusion and the indifference of mortgage companies. Many homeowners who have applied for loan modifications complain that their documents have been lost repeatedly or that they have been rejected without explanation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right to Mediation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Philadelphia program forces an outcome by bringing together all the principals in one room. If the mortgage company proves intractable, the homeowner has the right to request mediation in front of a volunteer lawyer serving as a provisional judge, who relays recommendations to the program's supervising judge. If the judge finds that the mortgage company is not acting in good faith, she can hold the house in limbo by denying permission for a sheriff's sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While data is scant, a legal aid group, Philadelphia Volunteers for the Indigent Program, has complete information on 61 of the 309 cases it has resolved since October 2008 through the anti-foreclosure program. Only five resulted in sheriff's sales, while 35 ended with loan modifications that lowered payments, the group says. The remaining 21 cases were divided among bankruptcies, loan forbearance and repayment arrangements, graceful exits and straightforward sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some suggest the city's program is plagued by the same basic defect as the Obama rescue plan: Nearly all the loans that have been modified have been altered on a trial basis, requiring homeowners to reapply for an extension of the terms after only a few months -- a process that appears rife with obstacles, according to participants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no teeth to the conciliation program,'' said Matthew B. Weisberg, a Philadelphia lawyer who represents homeowners in cases involving alleged mortgage fraud. ''It's a largely ineffective stopgap prolonging what appears to be the inevitable, which is the loss of homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Weisberg grudgingly praised the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's arbitrary and unpredictable,'' he said, ''but it's better than what anybody else is doing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheriff Delays Auction</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philadelphia's Residential Mortgage Foreclosure Diversion Pilot Program began with a resolution passed by the City Council in March 2008, calling on Sheriff John D. Green to scrap the sheriff's sale scheduled for April. Low-income neighborhoods were already experiencing a surge of foreclosures involving subprime loans given to people with tainted credit. With unemployment growing, lost paychecks were now pushing people into delinquency, reaching into middle-class and even wealthy neighborhoods. In early 2008, nearly 200 homes a month were being auctioned by the sheriff's office, about one-third more than in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In West Philadelphia, Councilman Curtis Jones Jr., one of the sponsors of the resolution, watched his childhood neighborhood consumed by foreclosure, as the homes of working families -- their porches once lined with flower pots -- were boarded up with plywood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It becomes a blight on your entire community,'' Mr. Jones said. ''It creates an environment that fosters everything bad, from prostitution to drug dealing to wildlife, like raccoons taking over whole houses. One house becomes 10, and 10 becomes the whole block.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to the resolution, Sheriff Green canceled the April sale. Meanwhile, Judge Annette M. Rizzo, who oversaw a local task force on stemming foreclosures, joined with the president judge of Philadelphia's Court of Common Pleas to develop the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Judge Rizzo, a high-energy woman who has long taken an interest in housing policy, the moratorium presented both a crisis and an opportunity. The sheriff was effectively refusing to fulfill his mandated responsibilities, leaving his office vulnerable to legal challenge. But if the mortgage companies could be persuaded to participate in an alternative way of addressing foreclosures, more people could stay in their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I realized we're either going to go down in flames or we're going to be a national model,'' Judge Rizzo said. ''We're going to look at these cases and see what we can work out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hall knew none of this. What he knew was that his life seemed to be unraveling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home to Four Generations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since he was a teenager, he had earned a middle-class living with his hands. He had been raised by his grandfather in his three-bedroom house on Akron Street, in a predominantly Irish Catholic working-class neighborhood in Northeast Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had attended St. Martin's, the Catholic school around the corner, married his childhood sweetheart and still remained in his grandfather's house, sending his own children -- two boys (now in their 20s) and a 12-year-old girl -- to the same school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hall, a soft-spoken yet intense man with a silver-tinged goatee, had worked seven days a week for much of this decade, bringing home weekly pay of about $1,000 -- enough to build a deck in his backyard; enough to obtain a fixed-rate mortgage and buy the house for $44,000 when his grandfather succumbed to Alzheimer's disease in the mid-1990s; enough for a motorcycle and a boat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But three years ago, Mr. Hall committed the sort of mistake that has upended millions of households. At the recommendation of a for-profit credit counselor, he took out a new mortgage -- a variable-rate loan from <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span>, which is now owned by <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>. He paid off some credit card debt, and he borrowed an extra $15,000 to renovate his home, expanding his mortgage balance to $63,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan began with manageable payments of about $500 a month. But Mr. Hall's interest rate soon soared -- something he says was never explained to him -- lifting his payments to $950 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I got the mortgage, I didn't really understand it,'' he said. ''They told me this would improve my credit and that was it. It was just, 'sign here,' and 'initial here.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No More Construction Work</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He might still have managed had construction not come to a halt. By 2007, Mr. Hall's employer was cutting work hours. In August 2008, it shut down, turning his $1,000 weekly paycheck into an $800 monthly unemployment check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every day, he set the alarm clock and headed to the union hall at 5 a.m., waiting and hoping for work. Every day, he went home, still jobless and discouraged, now confronting the displeasure of his wife, who worked as a nurse, and who he said never came to terms with their diminished spending power. After months of bickering, she left him last December, taking their daughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She was saying, 'How are we going to have Christmas? How are we going to go on vacation?' '' he recalled. ''She just seen it getting worse instead of better, and she got depressed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, his truck was repossessed, leaving him to walk through the winter dawn to the union hall for his daily ritual of defeat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He watched the For Sale signs proliferating on his block, as mostly elderly neighbors found themselves unable to make their mortgage payments. He saw their belongings piled up on their front lawns as they abandoned their homes to foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, the envelope finally landed with his default notice. A canvasser knocked on his door, proffering a flier urging him to call the city hot line. When he called, a housing counselor helped him assemble the paperwork for a loan modification and prepare for his conciliation conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he arrived inside courtroom 676 in October, Mr. Hall carried a sheaf of wrinkled papers in a white plastic grocery bag. He occupied a solid wooden chair as an announcer called off cases for hearing. ''Number 27, <span class="companylink">Wachovia Mortgage</span> versus ... .'' A girl no older than 6, with flower-shaped plastic barrettes in her hair, fidgeted as her mother applied for legal representation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hall was struggling to come to terms with what he assumed was the end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I put my whole life into this house,'' he said. ''After I do all this work, they want to take it from me. You've got to regroup and move, but where? If I can't pay my mortgage, how am I going to pay rent? And I have a whole house full of furniture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he got the news that he had a few weeks' reprieve, relief quickly gave way to the worry that had dominated his thoughts for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's postponing the inevitable,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm a man,'' he kept saying, trying to make sense of how a lifetime of working on other people's homes had put him here, staring at the potential loss of his own home; still hoping for relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't want no handouts,'' he said. ''I just want a reasonable loan that I can afford to pay so I can get on with my life.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enclosed by a dark brown fence, the weedy lot at Park Avenue and 56th Street in Midtown Manhattan is a conspicuous reminder of how ambitions were shattered in the recent real estate debacle. This vacant site, where the Drake Hotel once stood, is likely to leave a gash in the middle of the nation's costliest office submarket for years to come, real estate specialists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan has 79 other stalled construction sites but probably none to rival the Drake in location. ''It is inarguably the best development site in the country and possibly the world,'' said Woody Heller, an executive managing director at Studley, a real estate brokerage company. Just north of the site is 450 Park Avenue, an office building that traded in 2007 for a record price of $1,566 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, the New York developer Harry Macklowe bought the elegant Drake Hotel, opened in 1926, for $418 million, or about $847,000 a room. He tore it down the next year and planned to replace it with a 550,000-square-foot L-shaped building with luxury condominiums, an even more elegant hotel and Manhattan's first Nordstrom store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of acquiring additional properties to assemble the site increased the project's cost to at least $724 million, or about $1,300 a square foot before construction, brokers said. They say it is difficult to gauge its current value because the market in Manhattan has fallen so far, and few transactions have occurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To shore up his position in the deal, Mr. Macklowe made a huge personal investment in the project by paying off $156.3 million in certain loans in October 2007, which raised his stake in the project to $250 million. In court papers, Mr. Macklowe and his son, William, now the chief executive of the family business, said they invested their personal assets in the Drake site because of repeated assurances from <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> that the bank would refinance their loans when they matured in November 2007. But the loans were not refinanced, and the Macklowes defaulted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long afterward, the Macklowes lost a major portion of their real estate empire. Without a fight, they gave up control of seven Midtown office buildings that they had acquired at the peak of the boom, and a few months later, they sold their prized General Motors Building, on Fifth Avenue at 59th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Macklowes are tenaciously clinging to the Drake project and have told people they are determined to see it developed, most likely with a financial partner, even if they have to wait for years. Several brokers said the continuing involvement of Mr. Macklowe, who is considered highly creative but also litigious and a tough negotiator, adds a layer of complications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August 2008, Mr. Macklowe's longtime lender, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, sued to foreclose on loans for the hotel site and for nearby properties. Mr. Macklowe bought unused development rights, known as air rights, to eight townhouses on 57th Street to be able to add height to the building. He also sought to buy the townhouses themselves to give Nordstrom frontage on 57th Street opposite the Four Seasons Hotel but was only partly successful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Macklowe paid a record average price of $520 a square foot for the air rights, according to a case study by two recent graduate students at Columbia, Travis B. Olsen and Evan Woolley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Macklowes' construction plans were complex, the financing was even more convoluted. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> sliced the $559 million Drake loan into 21 separate pieces, each with a different level of risk. The bank kept about $12 million of the loan and sold the rest to eight investment groups, earning tens of millions of dollars in fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing a lawsuit, the Macklowes declined to comment publicly on the Drake. But in court documents, they accused the bank of lying to them and betraying their trust ''by making false promises it never intended to keep.'' Sounding like a jilted lover, they said the bank ''strung Macklowe Properties along until <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> got what it wanted, then refused to honor its commitments -- benefiting handsomely from its willfully dishonest, deceptive, bad faith and fraudulent conduct at Macklowe Properties' expense.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the bank succeeds in foreclosing, the Macklowes' investment ''will almost certainly be a total loss,'' they said. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the foreclosure suit, the Macklowes hold some cards, brokers say. In April 2007, they agreed to pay $47.5 million for a townhouse at 46 East 57th Street, where the luxury jeweler Buccellati is a tenant. The sale has not closed. If it does, it is possible that the Macklowes may successfully argue that this building -- and others -- are not part of the loan collateral, thus ensuring a role for themselves, according to real estate executives familiar with the Drake site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to leaving a big hole on Park Avenue, the stymied development has also had repercussions for a fancy shopping strip around the corner from the site that was intended to be included in the Macklowe project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town houses are still standing, but several of the storefronts are vacant. At 44 East 57th Street, which was the home for 60 years of Dalva Brothers, a store that specialized in 18th-century furniture, a cracked window is patched with duct tape and cardboard boxes are piled up inside. The Macklowes paid Dalva $2.2 million to move uptown. They also paid $19.2 million to buy the lease of the Swiss watchmaker Audemars Piguet at 40 East 57th Street and move the store to the north side of 57th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Macklowes did not succeed in putting all the parts together. Nordstrom, which had signed a letter of intent to build a store with 253,500 square feet, backed out after the Macklowes failed to acquire all the buildings needed to create the 57th Street entrance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One holdout is Turnbull &amp; Asser, a men's clothing store where shirts start at $275. It had been in contract to collect $33 million for moving from 42 East 57th Street to another town house, according a document prepared by Cushman &amp; Wakefield. But in May 2008, the owner of Turnbull &amp; Asser, Ali al-Fayed, exercised his option to buy the building from the previous owner for $31.5 million. Now, said Louis Verde, the manager, ''we're not going anywhere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another holdout is Jacob the Jeweler at 50 East 57th Street, which reportedly demanded $100 million to move. The company had no comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, <span class="companylink">iStar Financial</span>, a real estate investment trust in New York that holds the largest chunk of the senior debt on the Drake, tried to sell its $224 million note at a discount. When the bids came in well below the $160 million asking price, iStar took it off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Jeffrey W. Baker, an executive managing director at Savills, a mortgage brokerage, said prospects for such deals were improving. Several of his overseas clients have shown interest in acquiring the Drake loan with the intention of gaining control of the property, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While the complexities and risks of the deal have reduced the number of potential buyers significantly,'' Mr. Baker said, ''the growing consensus overseas is that market conditions are near bottom and that now is the time to acquire trophy U.S. assets at bargain prices.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. -- In the mid-1980s J. Dennis Delafield and his cousins faced a hard fact: They could no longer afford to maintain the estate established in 1802 by their distant ancestor, Janet Livingston Montgomery, widow of Gen. Richard Montgomery, a hero of the Revolutionary War.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was eating us up alive,'' Mr. Delafield said of Montgomery Place, a majestic house overlooking the Hudson River that is but one small part of the 434-acre property here. ''We had to let it go, though it broke our hearts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They decided to turn the house and its grounds, with working orchards and more than a dozen outbuildings, into a museum. So they sold it to what is now Historic Hudson Valley, a nonprofit group founded by John D. Rockefeller Jr. that owns Washington Irving's house, Sunnyside, in Tarrytown, N.Y., and several other properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We made a bargain sale in the belief that that way the house would be protected,'' Mr. Delafield said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, though, Mr. Delafield and others are worried about the fate of Montgomery Place. The house was closed to the public in 2006 -- though the grounds were available for weddings, photo shoots and other events -- until August, when it was hastily reopened for four hours on Fridays after a state official began inquiring about its status. Under the terms of a state financing package, the house must be open at least 12 days a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rumors have run rampant this fall that Historic Hudson Valley plans to sell the house, vexing public officials who have sought definitive information from the group's leader, Waddell W. Stillman. ''I've dealt with him on a number of occasions, and I've never felt we always got the full story,'' said Marcus J. Molinaro, the New York state assemblyman who represents the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent interview at Montgomery Place, Mr. Stillman denied that the organization's board planned to sell all or any part of the property. ''We have not discussed a sale,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, minutes of board meetings obtained by The New York Times make it clear that the board discussed just that on several occasions. ''Mr. Herbert E. Nass asked whether we could sell Montgomery Place in parts, and whether doing so could yield a better price over time,'' the minutes of a March 10 meeting state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same meeting the board chairman, Michael Hegarty, raised concerns about rebuilding the organization's endowment, which like many others was hard hit by the economic downturn. ''To do this, Mr. Hegarty believes we must consider the sale of assets, such as the president's house adjacent to the Philipsburg Manor'' -- another of the organization's historic houses -- ''and some or perhaps all of the property at Montgomery Place,'' the minutes say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board even formed a committee to explore ''existing conditions and constraints'' at Montgomery Place; at a June meeting its members described several potential buyers, according to notes by board members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about the discrepancy, Mr. Stillman said the minutes represented ''old news.'' ''The board's March meeting coincided exactly with the nadir in the financial markets,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''Everyone was distressed about the decline in our endowment, and economic prospects were grim. A wide-ranging discussion ensued about the sale of assets, including Montgomery Place, and nothing was decided or acted upon, then or since.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The topic is no longer on the board's agenda,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A draft resolution to offer to sell some of the land to a state agency that holds an easement on part of the estate had been floated for consideration at a meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stillman said the resolution had not been considered by or proposed to the board and would not be taken up on Wednesday. He also said the reopening of the house on Fridays was unrelated to the state official's inquiries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stillman, who joined Historic Hudson Valley in 1992, said his group could not afford the $500,000 in annual operating costs for Montgomery Place, let alone pay for necessary renovations. Nor would it be possible to reopen the house next year, as originally planned, he said. Indeed, he said, the decision to buy the house in the first place had been a bad one. ''We broke some of the textbook rules for not getting ahead of yourself,'' he said. ''We didn't have the money to buy it, we didn't have the money to maintain it, and we way underestimated how much it would take to restore it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But several former board members, led by the Wall Street financier Richard Jenrette, said they had proposed ways to support Montgomery Place, including offers to help Historic Hudson Valley cover some costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of its continuous ownership by descendants of Mrs. Montgomery, Montgomery Place is a rare example of an intact Hudson Valley estate. Alexander Jackson Davis, the influential 19th-century architect who designed many of the area's prominent houses, redesigned Montgomery and designed several other structures on the property. The landscape architect Andrew Jackson Downing provided advice on the design of the grounds and designed one garden himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house plays an important role in the community, too, Mr. Molinaro said, attracting tourists and helping to educate students in the area's history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jenrette has proposed that Historic Hudson Valley donate the property to the Classical American Homes Preservation Trust, a foundation to which he has donated six historic houses. He and others have offered to create a friends group to raise money to support Montgomery Place. Most recently, he and John S. Dyson, another former board member and a venture capitalist, offered to put up $100,000 a year for five years to keep it open. ''We think we can get at least another $100,000 to match that, and if we could create a friends group, we could raise a lot more money,'' Mr. Jenrette said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a meeting earlier this month, however, Mr. Stillman and Mr. Hegarty rejected that offer. Mr. Stillman said in the interview that he did not want to create another nonprofit group that would do the same thing as Historic Hudson Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to owning three other historic houses and a church in the region, Historic Hudson Valley recently broke ground on a regional history center in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., on nine acres donated by Laurance Rockefeller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center will provide offices for the organization, as well as space for scholars and researchers seeking access to its extensive archives and records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stillman envisions creating a digital archive of the contents of Historic Hudson Valley's houses to provide virtual tours and other activities to attract a new breed of tourists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the group does not yet have the $15 million it needs to build the center, it began construction last month because it would otherwise lose a $6 million grant from a state financing agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their meetings, according to the minutes obtained by The Times, Historic Hudson Valley board members discussed their concerns that public officials and others would assume they were using proceeds from the sale of Montgomery Place to finance the construction of the center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They will deny that, but money is fungible,'' said John H. Dobkin, a preservation expert who was the organization's executive director from 1984 to 2000. ''They'll say it's to replenish the endowment, but you don't sell a unique asset like Montgomery Place to do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As chairman of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, Mr. Stillman put through a plan ending that organization's membership structure, selling its historic home and handing over its archives to the New York Public Library, keeping only a digitized version of them. ''Historic house museums are in the same place as classical music orchestras,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historic Hudson Valley's endowment fell to $45 million last spring from about $70 million and now stands at roughly $49 million, according to Rob Schweitzer, spokesman for the organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the standards of organizations supporting historic homes, that is a handsome sum even at its depleted level. The Classical American Homes trust, for example, operates six houses with $9 million in liquid assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a pact between nonprofits and the people because we extend to them certain tax benefits and, in the case of Historic Hudson Valley, millions of dollars in public grants,'' Mr. Molinaro, the assemblyman, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they have a desire to divest of this asset, they certainly shouldn't benefit financially from all that public investment.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movement to ban smoking in New York City has grown so quickly that no place seems immune -- certainly not restaurants or bars, and public beaches and parks may not be far behind. Now the efforts are rapidly expanding into the living room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More landlords are moving to prohibit smoking in their apartment buildings, telling prospective tenants they can be evicted if they light up in them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, the Related Companies will ban smoking at some of its downtown apartment buildings because of health concerns about secondhand smoke, according to company officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smokers who already live in any of these buildings will not be affected, according to Jeff Brodsky, a president of Related, which is a national developer with 17 buildings in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But any new renters must promise not to smoke at home, even if they continue to elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenbar Management, a local developer, is going a step further. When its new project, 1510 Lexington Avenue, opens in December, smoking will be banned in all 298 units, in addition to private and shared terraces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the typical smoker's refuge -- directly outside the building -- is also off limits; tenants must agree not to smoke on any of the sidewalks that wrap around the building, which takes up most of a block in East Harlem, according to Kinne Yon, a Kenbar principal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend has predictably divided smokers and nonsmokers in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's absolutely absurd,'' said Bryan Marx, 53, a cabinetmaker who has lived at Tribeca Park, a Related building on Chambers Street, since 1999. He smokes hand-rolled cigarettes in his apartment, but said that he cut back on a cigar habit a few years ago to appease a neighbor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How about a little tolerance?'' Mr. Marx added. ''Smokers have become the whipping boys for everything that's unhealthy about living in New York City.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, the movement to ban smoking in residential buildings is gaining traction. The Department of Housing and Urban Developmenthas strongly encouraged public housing agencies to ban smoking in some or all of their units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, about 50 public housing agencies have now forbidden smoking, according to Betsy Feigin Befus, a lawyer with the National Multi Housing Council, a landlord trade group that has tracked the efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other cities, through legislation or by initiatives of developers, have taken similar steps. In California, for example, all apartments and condos in Richmond, near San Francisco, must outlaw cigarette smoking, according to an ordinance passed in July. Across the bay in Belmont, a ban on smoking in apartments took effect in January after a 14-month grace period, with $100 fines possible for offenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there is no question about the dangers of secondhand smoke, there is debate about whether the amount of smoke that may be transmitted from one apartment to another is harmful. A recent study by New York City's health department found that about 57 percent of nonsmokers had been exposed to substantial levels of cigarette smoke, raising suspicions among experts that apartment dwellers might be susceptible to secondhand smoke from their neighbors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City has been at the forefront of efforts to ban smoking in bars and restaurants, and the city's health commissioner, Dr. Thomas A. Farley, said in September that he supported a ban on smoking at city beaches and parks. But the city, he said, has no plan to push for a smoking ban in public housing developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city did help Related research the health effects of smoke in apartment buildings, Dr. Farley said, adding, ''Our focus would be on individuals having their homes smoke-free.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pan Am Equities, a real estate management company, may have been one of the first in New York to introduce a smoking ban to an apartment building. About 18 months ago, the company asked new renters to promise not to smoke; the ban did not affect existing tenants, according to David Iwanier, a company vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of Pan Am's rentals -- which include 270 Park Avenue South, 145 West 67th Street and 60 West 23rd Street -- are affected, though Mr. Iwanier would not discuss the reasons for the ban.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was just something we decided to do,'' he said. And in terms of lease renewals, he added, ''we've not had any negative feedback.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brodsky, of Related, said that existing tenants would be reassured that they would not be evicted or pressured to leave. He would not specify which of the developer's buildings are in line for the ban, saying only that they are among the six in or near Battery Park City and Chelsea. Those include Tribeca Park; the Caledonia, which abuts the High Line park; and Tribeca Green in Battery Park City, which bills itself as ''New York's most environmental rental.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's a bloody good thing,'' said Dale Smith, 41, a Broadway producer who formerly worked in the health care industry. A resident of Tribeca Green for nearly three years, Mr. Smith, who does not smoke, said he had complained to his landlord about secondhand smoke in his apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A policy that is in place because something has proven to be hazardous in eating establishments should be effective in the home,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say there is no known law in the United States that prohibits landlords from banning smoking in their buildings, and many trial judges have sided with the nonsmoker. In New York, for example, a 2006 decision found that tenants had the right to break a lease because the landlord failed to safeguard an apartment from secondhand smoke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-ops and condominiums have been somewhat slower to embrace such bans, according to real estate lawyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews with several lawyers who represent real estate concerns, only one, Stuart Saft, knew of any buildings that had instituted a smoking ban. He said that of the 100 or so co-op buildings he represents on the Upper East and West Sides of Manhattan, only two have banned smoking outright in the last few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A poll commissioned by the NYC Coalition for a Smoke Free City suggested that a residential smoking ban might not hurt rentals or sales. The survey of 1,000 New Yorkers, which was administered by <span class="companylink">Zogby International</span> in July, found that 58 percent would pay more to live in smoke-free housing; 68 percent might not live in a smoking building in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet some real estate brokers question the wisdom of instituting a smoking ban during a housing downturn, with vacancy rates climbing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That 950,000 New Yorkers -- or 16 percent of the population -- call themselves smokers, according to the city's health department, is not insignificant, said Daniel Baum, chief executive at the Developers Group/The Real Estate Group of New York, a brokerage that focuses on rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think in general it's probably not an ideal time to try to limit potential tenants,'' Mr. Baum said. ''Every occupied apartment counts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Audrey Silk, the founder of Citizens Lobbying Against Smoker Harassment, a nine-year-old advocacy group, said the trend was troubling from a civil liberties perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we're talking about annoying odors, where do you draw the line?'' she said. ''What about cooking odors, from fish or curry?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet some smokers seemed resigned to their fate. Brian Mossotti, 28, a day trader, moved into the Pan Am-run building on 23rd Street 14 months ago, after the developer's ban had taken effect. After receiving three warnings from management about fumes in the hallway, including a stern letter in September, Mr. Mossotti finally agreed to take his two-a-day cigarette habit to the sidewalk, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't smoke in bars becauseof the whole secondhand smoke thing, so it doesn't surprise me,'' he said. ''But it is irritating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: Bryan Marx, 53, a smoker who lives at Tribeca Park in Manhattan, said a ban in apartments would be ''absolutely absurd.''

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- When the ceremonial first salvo had been tossed in McCourt v. McCourt, the principals in the divorce case, the Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and his erstwhile business partner Jamie McCourt, had at least put to rest a question that had dogged them since they bought the team nearly six years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are they in it to win it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what is shaping up as the most riveting contact sport that will take place in Los Angeles this winter, the McCourts wasted little time -- or, it seems, expense -- in assembling all-star lineups for a divorce trial whose outcome could force the sale of the team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advising Jamie McCourt is Bert Fields, the entertainment lawyer who has represented, among others, Michael Jackson and the Beatles. Her lead counsel is Dennis Wasser, who has pleaded the divorce cases of Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg, Clint Eastwood and Jennifer Lopez. Also in her corner is <span class="companylink">Sitrick &amp; Company</span>, the city's most prominent crisis-management firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Counseling Frank McCourt is Marshall Grossman, his lawyer with the Dodgers, who has also represented Apple, AIG, the author J. K. Rowling and ESPN's peeping-tom victim, Erin Andrews. His lead counsel is Manley Freid, who represented Tom Arnold in his divorce from Roseanne Barr and Rene Elizondo Jr. in his split with Janet Jackson. (The judge in this family court, Scott Gordon, presided over the divorce of Britney Spears and Kevin Federline.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the measure of one's commitment is the size of one's retainer, then consider the McCourts all in. Wasser estimated in court filings that Jamie McCourt's legal fees would run $2 million -- enough to cover the combined salaries last season for Matt Kemp, James Loney, Clayton Kershaw and Chad Billingsley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case is not expected to go to trial before spring training, a lawyer for Jamie McCourt said. But the court filings indicate that the dissolution of the 30-year marriage between hard-edged, successful business partners will involve collateral damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank McCourt fired his wife and the executive she had hired, Dr. Charles Steinberg. Last week, he let go six employees who were hired by Steinberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dodgers fans have had to change their off-season routine. Instead of tracking the free-agent pool and diving into sabermetrics, they monitor TMZ, the celebrity news site, which has posted several documents in the case, and Dodgerdivorce.com, a blog started by a fan, Joshua Fisher, a 23-year-old law school student.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The early slings and arrows have also poked a few holes in the curtain that usually shades the operations of a sports franchise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after the couple separated in early July, Jamie McCourt took a monthlong business trip to Israel and France with a new romantic interest, her chauffeur. According to her filing, the team paid her $2 million and her husband $6 million and $7 million annually. Some fans wonder if some of that money might have helped the Dodgers get past Philadelphia and into the World Series the last two seasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think anyone has a particular horse in this race,'' said Jon Weisman, who runs the Dodger Thoughts blog on The Los Angeles Times's Web site, referring to the fans' interest. ''I think they want whoever is going to be the best steward, although a lot of people feel neither of them are capable of that right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the moment the McCourts bought the team in 2004, they have been consumed with their image. They have employed at least six publicists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although they had succeeded in keeping a lower profile recently, the McCourts could not always help themselves. Last winter, Jamie McCourt wondered aloud whether fans would rather the team put $30 million toward Little League fields or toward a slugger like Manny Ramirez -- as if it were a choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the McCourts have drastically raised ticket, parking and concession prices, and because they bought neighboring homes in Malibu and Holmby Hills for $72.5 million (to go along with two vacation homes on Cape Cod, a condo in Vail, Colo., and properties in Montana and Cabo San Lucas, Mexico), she may as well have been saying to Dodgers fans, Let them eat cake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They've had this weird, tone-deaf history of public relations,'' Weisman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Jamie McCourt's court filing, she described herself as the face of the Dodgers, perhaps forgetting about Manager Joe Torre, Ramirez or Kemp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Jamie drew a whole lot of ire for coming out in the documents proclaiming she was the face of the Dodgers,'' said Fisher, the legal blogger. ''It might not have been true when she made it, but it sure as heck is now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key legal issue is whether the Dodgers are considered the McCourts' community property. Under California law, a couple's assets are split 50-50 unless a written agreement states otherwise. Shortly after buying the Dodgers, the McCourts put the team in Frank's name and all their property in Jamie's name to protect the homes from potential creditors. One of her lawyers, Michael Kump, said they would challenge the validity of the postnuptial agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the agreement is not valid, Fisher said, the McCourts would probably be forced to sell, as John Moores did with the San Diego Padres when he divorced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any event, the McCourts' divorce figures to be the subtext beneath every move the Dodgers make -- or do not make -- before next season. Their payroll at the start of 2009 was $100 million, less than it was the year before the McCourts bought the team. When the Dodgers recently reduced the annual salary of the 87-year-old scout George Genovese to $8,000 from $18,000, a local columnist juxtaposed the pay cut with the $6,000 the McCourts spent on birthday parties each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will they make a play for John Lackey, the leading free-agent pitcher? Will they try to sign Kemp, the team's arbitration-eligible cornerstone, to a long-term contract? The Dodgers have gone to great lengths to send signals that it is business as usual. They re-signed General Manager Ned Colletti and discussed an extension with Torre, whose contract expires after 2010. But players with interest in the Dodgers may be waiting to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Grossman, Frank McCourt's lawyer, was asked how much the divorce would affect the Dodgers, he did not wait for the question to be completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Zero, zero, zero,'' Grossman said, a figure that may equal the number of people who believe that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- THE gang's nickname is still up for grabs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four teenage girls and two men suspected of stealing jewelry and clothing from the homes of Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, Orlando Bloom and other celebrities have been tagged with a few tantalizing names since their purported crime spree came to light. ''The Burglar Bunch,'' trumpeted TMZ. ''The Bling Ring,'' rhymed The Los Angeles Times. The ''Hollywood Hills Burglars,'' said the Los Angeles police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group, most 18 and 19 years old, used celebrity Web sites, according to investigators, to figure out when their victims -- a roster of young Hollywood that also includes Rachel Bilson of ''The O.C.,'' Ashley Tisdale of ''High School Musical'' fame and Audrina Patridge of ''The Hills''-- would be attending premieres and other events and would therefore not be home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the stars' homes, burglars helped themselves to Rolex watches, Louis Vuitton bags and other baubles featured in celebrity magazines, authorities say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six accused members of the ring have been charged with residential burglary and other crimes, including one, Alexis Neiers, who was arrested on the set of a reality show pilot she is filming for E! with her sister Tess Taylor, a Playboy model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rich enough for you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tale lies at the intersection of celebrity, teen culture, reality TV and the Internet. It doesn't hurt the chances of the -- let's go with ''Bling Ring'' -- becoming the subject of a movie that the teenagers ''look like the cast of 'Twilight,' '' as one Hollywood lawyer put it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six who have been charged are Nicholas Prugo, 19; Diana Tamayo, 19; Courtney Ames, 19; Ms. Neiers, 18; Roy Lopez Jr., 27, a bouncer; and Jonathan Ajar, 28, nightclub promoter. Mr. Ajar faces related drug and weapons charges but has not been charged with burglary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another teenager, who police in Los Angeles have said is the ringleader, Rachel Lee, 18, was arrested in Las Vegas and is expected to be charged soon, said Detective Brett Goodkin of the Los Angeles Police Department, the lead investigator in the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A search of Ms. Lee's father's home in Las Vegas turned up over $20,000, designer jeans and photos of Ms. Hilton, Detective Goodkin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ajar has pleaded not guilty. The others, whose arraignments are expected in the next few weeks, have not yet entered pleas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the teenagers knew one another from Calabasas, Calif., an affluent suburb of rolling foothills in the western San Fernando Valley. Although it is more rural than the Hollywood Hills, some 30 minutes away, where many of the celebrity victims live, Calabasas has its share of stars: Will Smith and Kourtney Kardashian from the reality show ''Keeping Up With the Kardashians.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celebrities -- and a celebrity lifestyle -- are close enough to reach out and touch, even more so thanks to gossip Web sites that track the nightly antics of young celebutants, and reality shows like ''The Hills'' that portray beautiful young people, seemingly just like you, living large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Young people see a lifestyle on television and have peer pressure and constant bombardment from media to have what other people have, to want what other people want and to try to live the dream,'' said Jason Peirce, the host of ''Calabasas Teen Forum,'' a local cable television program. Police say that some of the stolen bling was fenced for cash, while other items were kept as trophies. Friends of the accused say they wore the stylish clothes and Rolex watches belonging to the stars. In the case of Ms. Hilton's home, they returned three or four times, authorities said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bling Ring is not a reality show. It is reality, with a wide-ranging cast of characters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lee and Mr. Prugo were classmates at a remedial high school, Indian Hills, to which they transferred because of truancy issues at Calabasas High School, friends said. Ms. Lee, who drove a white Audi A4, was named ''best dressed'' in the 2007 Indian Hills yearbook. ''She dressed very trendy, things like what celebrities wore,'' recalled Dani Ley, a classmate. ''Everyone would be in jeans and shorts. She would come in fancy jean skirts and fancy tops.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friends said that Ms. Lee had trouble at home. Her mother, who had been single for many years, started a relationship that displeased her, said one longtime friend of Ms. Lee's, who asked that her name not be used to avoid retribution from the Bling Ring. ''That's when she started having problems with her mom,'' the friend said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lee's small house near the high school was sometimes a hangout, where Mr. Prugo, Ms. Ames and others from Indian Hills could be found ''having a kickback,'' said the friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stealing started small about two years ago, said Sean Erenstoft, Mr. Prugo's lawyer. Mr. Erenstoft was forthcoming with information because the contents of an affidavit in which his client is quoted admitting many of the crimes to police has become public. The lawyer is seeking to portray Mr. Prugo as a young man with low self-esteem who was manipulated by Ms. Lee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Rachel for fun would break into cars in rich neighborhoods,'' Mr. Erenstoft said. ''She would yank on the handles of cars to see if they were locked. They find an open door, grab a roach.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That version of events, with Ms. Lee as the ringleader, was disputed by David Diamond, the lawyer for Mr. Lopez. He said that it was Mr. Prugo who was the mastermind and is pointing the finger at everyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lawyer representing Ms. Lee did not respond to requests for comment. Her mother, who works at a tutoring company, also did not return calls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Prugo's home is on a narrow canyon lane. His mother runs a dog-walking service and his father is an executive at IM Global, a distribution company that sells international rights to films, including the recent hit ''Paranormal Activity.'' In 2003, Nick Prugo had a role in ''Little Lost Souls: Children Possessed,'' a film about children whose parents think they are possessed by evil spirits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late last year, the misbehavior escalated. In December, according to court documents, Mr. Prugo and others burglarized Ms. Hilton's home in Sherman Oaks by entering through an open door and making off with jewelry and other belongings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear why the teenagers graduated from parked cars to celebrity homes, but once they did they apparently found the Internet an excellent aid: they consulted sites like TMZ to learn of stars' comings and goings and celebrityaddressaerial.com to learn their home addresses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Prugo stated that it was Lee who would suggest a target and that he would surf the Internet to learn where the celebrity lived as well as the target's travel itinerary,'' according to a Las Vegas police search warrant quoted by The Associated Press.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February 2009, while Ms. Patridge, a long-time cast member of MTV's reality drama ''The Hills,'' on which she worked for a record label, was at a party, her home was burglarized. The actress posted security-camera video online: Two thieves, who Mr. Erenstoft said are Mr. Prugo and Ms. Lee, did not appear to be very methodical, returning to one room repeatedly and seeming to be in no particular hurry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, the home of Ms. Bilson, whose ''O.C.'' character was the best friend of Mischa Barton's, was burglarized while she was in Canada, the thieves making off with Chanel clothing and size 5 vintage shoes. In July, jewelry and watches worth a reported $500,000 were stolen from Orlando Bloom's house while he was in New York filming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the summer, some of the Calabasas friends hung out at Zuma Beach, usually near lifeguard stand No. 7, the destination for generations of local teenagers. A friend of Mr. Prugo's who requested anonymity to maintain the friendship said he was at Zuma with Mr. Prugo, Ms. Lee, Ms. Neiers and her sister Tess Taylor. There was no talk of the capers. ''We usually just kick back and hang out on the beach with a group of us,'' he said. ''Just tan and hang out and talk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Neiers, who was charged with one count of burglary for the break-in at the residence of Mr. Bloom, who played a heartthrob character in ''Pirates of the Caribbean,'' described herself on her MySpace page: ''I am currently working as a full-time model and actress but in my spare time (when I have any haha) I am a pilates, pole dance and hip hop instructor.'' On April 15, she tweeted: ''Tess and I woke up to a call from Hugh Hef. Letting her know that she got a 6 pg layout and the cover for playboy! He asked me too but idk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A person familiar with the show the sisters are filming for E! said it is about growing up on self-help books like ''The Secret.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photos of Ms. Neiers and Ms. Taylor have been published showing them wearing what appears to be some of the stolen merchandise. Their lawyer, Jeffery Rubenstein, said they did not take part in the burglaries and are guilty only of being friends with Mr. Prugo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The girls were doing model shoots and Nick said, 'I'm a stylist' -- he's a little stylist kind of kid,'' the lawyer said. ''He says, 'I have stuff left over from a photo shoot and you can borrow it.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said his clients are ''ankle-deep in this, not neck-deep.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At night, the Calabasas friends visited Hollywood clubs such as Miyagi's and Le Deux, where Mr. Ajar was a promoter and gave the teenagers drink tickets, friends of the group said. But there were sometimes stops along the way, such as Ms. Hilton's house, which the ring visited three or more times, the authorities said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Paris left her front key under the mat,'' Mr. Erenstoft said. ''Not to mention she left her safe open.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ames and Mr. Lopez, who both worked at the Sagebrush Cantina, a popular restaurant and bar in Calabasas, were charged with one count each of residential burglary at Ms. Hilton's home. Mr. Diamond said his client, Mr. Lopez, had nothing to do with the burglary. ''He has never ever been inside or near Paris Hilton's house,'' Mr. Diamond said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the house where Ms. Ames grew up in Calabasas, a man who identified himself as her stepfather said that she had been friends with Ms. Lee since eighth grade but had not taken part in the burglaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When they were saying, 'We're going to do stuff,' she said, 'No I'm not going to do that stuff,' '' said the man, who declined to give his name. ''They'd pick her up after doing it and then go to clubs. That was Nick's appeal. He got her into clubs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most cases, the burglars found open doors; once they relied on Ms. Tamayo's small size, Mr. Erenstoft said. ''She went in through a dog door.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tamayo, who has been charged in the burglaries of Ms. Lohan and Ms. Tisdale (who played the female antagonist in ''High School Musical'') lived in one of the few apartment buildings in Calabasas with her family while attending high school. At school, she had a reputation for getting into fights, current and former students said. She was elected class president and named ''best smile'' in the 2007 Indian Hills yearbook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When police searched her current address, a small rental unit near the freeway 15 minutes west of Calabasas, they found Chanel, Hermes and Louis Vuitton bags, Paris Hilton brand perfume and four pairs of designer shoes, according to a search warrant. Approached there by a reporter, Ms. Tamayo declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the gatherings at the clubs and at Ms. Lee's house, there were parties at Mr. Prugo's house. Mr. Prugo's friend from Zuma Beach said that at the parties, Mr. Prugo boasted about the crimes. ''He would brag about it and you wouldn't believe it to be true,'' the friend said. ''It seemed so far-fetched that he was robbing all these celebrities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tip led police to arrest Mr. Prugo in September. Soon Ms. Lee and the others were apprehended. All except Mr. Ajar, whose bail was set at $400,000, have been released on bail. At least $2 million worth of merchandise has been recovered, but more is missing, Detective Goodkin said. At Mr. Ajar's house, A Sig Sauer pistol registered to another celebrity victim, Brian Austin Green, was found. Mr. Ajar, who has not been charged with burglary, faces drug and weapons charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In coverage of the Bling Ring, there has been much speculation about what turns teenagers to such crimes: Is it lax parenting? Have children raised on reality TV and intimate-sounding Tweets from movie stars lost all boundaries between the screen and themselves?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blair Berk, a lawyer who has represented Ms. Lohan and other celebrities, said that in the brief comments some Bling Ring members have made to the ubiquitous video cameras that now follow them, they seem to be having a good time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wait until they become the people they robbed,'' she said. ''Give it 60 days before these kids are household names.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A TWO-BEDROOM apartment on the Upper West Side is listed at $1.595 million and sells within two weeks after nine prospective buyers race to outbid one another, ultimately pushing the price to nearly $1.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sound like the pandemonium of the last real estate boom, when anyone with a pulse could get a mortgage and it seemed as if prices could go only up?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't. Try last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year after the economy headed into a tailspin and at a time when most New Yorkers are still wondering whether real estate prices have hit bottom, brokers say that bidding wars are back. They are breaking out in all sectors of the market, from $400,000 one-bedrooms in Brooklyn Heights to $7 million apartments with grand park views at 15 Central Park West, and from stately Park Avenue prewar apartments to new condominiums in Williamsburg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, the jousting buyers start and end below the asking price. But in others, multiple bidders are pushing prices well above list price. To add a confounding twist, many of the bids are being made by buyers willing and able to pay all cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that bidding wars are almost always set up by listings that are ''priced well,'' and by that they mean 20 to 30 percent below the high-water marks of early 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, estimated that two-thirds of the roughly 4,000 apartments for sale in Manhattan are priced too high for the current market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So,'' Mr. Miller said, ''you have this weird situation right now where you have above-average inventory, but people are fighting over the ones that are priced correctly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amelia S. Gewirtz, an executive vice president of Halstead Property, and her partner, Andrew Phillips, helped drive the $1.595 million two-bedroom to a $1.8 million contract price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you price for 2009 or even 2010 -- in other words, for buyers who think prices might go down another 5 or 10 percent,'' Ms. Gewirtz said, ''there's a really good shot that you will get rewarded for pricing it to value.'' She said that the buyers who came to see the $1.595 million apartment ''knew what the competition was, and they recognized that it was priced well. If we had priced it for 2008, we wouldn't have gotten what we wanted.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five of the nine offers, including the winning bid, were all cash, she said, adding that the prospective buyers were a varied lot, including empty nesters planning to move back to the city from the suburbs, renters who had been waiting for the right moment to buy, and foreigners hoping to take advantage of the falling dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that the months of near inactivity that started with the demise of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> last fall and stretched into late spring also created a great deal of pent-up demand. Many apartment hunters re-entered the market after Labor Day with a steely determination to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's definitely been a shift in the confidence of buyers in the last two months,'' said Jessica Cohen, a senior vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of Jill and Jonathan Steinberg's apartment on the Upper West Side is a good illustration of the changing real estate psyche. The Steinbergs put their one-bedroom on the market for $699,000 on the day that <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The timing couldn't have possibly been worse,'' Ms. Steinberg said. ''It was an absolute disaster.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment, a high-rise unit with a balcony and open city views, sat on the market for seven months. Even after they dropped the price to $649,000, the Steinbergs received only three offers, all around $585,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disheartened, they took the place off the market in June. But by late summer, the market seemed to have leveled off, so they sought a new broker and found Ms. Cohen. She suggested they list it at $645,000 right before Labor Day, to avoid the post-summer rush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifteen people came to their first open house, and someone made an offer that very day, Ms. Steinberg recalled. ''Then another buyer came along and offered full price -- it was so surreal,'' she said. The first buyer countered with $650,000, but later withdrew the bid. The Steinbergs are now in contract with the second bidder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were beyond ecstatic to take our asking price,'' Ms. Steinberg said. ''It was a much different experience than we had the first time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, scarcity, or even the perception of scarcity, can spark bidding wars. At the Rialto, a new 31-unit condo in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, sales started 14 months ago. The building had its first bidding war in August, when there were only seven units left; two more bidding wars followed in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HighlyAnn Krasnow, an executive vice president of the Developers Group, said that in the current climate, in which developers are cutting prices and offering to pay closing costs to attract buyers, the multiple bids at the Rialto took her by surprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a little bit unexpected,'' Ms. Krasnow said, ''and I think it's a good sign for the market in general.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more direct way to generate excitement in a property is to price it below market value, said Genifer Lancaster, an agent with Prudential Douglas Elliman. She advised some clients, sellers at 145 Nassau Street, an iconic building opposite City Hall, to list their 1,800- square-foot loft at $1.1 million. ''This apartment was a jewel,'' Ms. Lancaster said, ''but the financial district is not one of the stronger neighborhoods, and there have been very few transactions down here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Nemerson, who was selling the apartment as the executor of his father's estate, said that other brokers had suggested $1.4 million, ''but Genifer persuaded us that if we generated a lot of traffic, you never know what might happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turned out to be a gamble worth taking. Two weeks after the apartment went on the market in late May, there were 13 bids in hand, and the best and highest bid was an all-cash deal for $1.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Needless to say, the outcome exceeded our expectations,'' Ms. Lancaster said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tentativeness of the credit market has given buyers with large amounts of cash a decided advantage over buyers who need a mortgage and are thus subject to the whims of lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a great deal of bargaining power in being able to close promptly without any hiccups that might occur with the borrowing process,'' said Luigi Rosabianca, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, not every all-cash buyer is a foreigner arriving with a suitcase stuffed with bills. Mr. Rosabianca said he had one client, a business owner, who had planned to secure 70 percent financing for an apartment on the Upper East Side, but decided against it when the bank withdrew the 5.5 percent mortgage rate it had offered him and raised the rate above 7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than lose the deal and have the loan denied, the buyer ended up taking the unusual step of borrowing against his retirement plan to make it a cash transaction, and was able to close in two weeks, Mr. Rosabianca said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the ability to close a deal quickly now ranks high in the minds of many sellers and their co-op or condo boards, the whole psychology behind bidding wars has shifted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At the height of the market, bidding wars weren't based on real prices,'' said Dottie Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''Twenty people wanted it, there was no inventory and it didn't matter what the number went to.'' But now, she said, ''things are being bid up only when people see real value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Christopher Stanley, an agent with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, got an estate listing for a Classic 8 corner apartment on Park Avenue, he knew he would have to price it to move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 3,200-square-foot apartment has three bedrooms, two baths, three maids' rooms and two maids' baths, and it had been impeccably renovated -- back in 1971. Mr. Stanley thinks it would easily have sold for more than $5 million two years ago. But knowing that any buyer would want to renovate the space, he put it on the market for $4.2 million right before Labor Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven buyers put in bids. ''Everybody came in under the asking price because that's what everybody thinks they have to do,'' Mr. Stanley said. ''But the seller stood firm at full ask and the bidders all came up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bidding war lasted two weeks. The apartment is now in contract in an all-cash deal for about 4 percent above the asking price, or roughly $4.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To shorten the process, brokers faced with multiple offers will often set a deadline and ask buyers to submit their best and final offers in sealed envelopes. But they say they are careful not to create a frenzy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The way we negotiate a bidding war is different now,'' said Jordan Hoch, another vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''You want people to feel comfortable with what they're paying and you don't want them to put out a number that's too big and then have them get buyer's remorse and back out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a bidding war develops, skeptical buyers often wonder if other bidders truly exist. Tristan H. Harper, a senior vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, had just such a client, Larry Ruskin, a retired oil and gas executive from Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ruskin low-balled a $7.9 million two-bedroom apartment at 15 Central Park West, offering $5.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They didn't even want to talk to us,'' Mr. Harper said. But he convinced the seller's broker that Mr. Ruskin was a serious buyer. When that broker said another buyer had bid more and called for final offers, Mr. Ruskin offered $7.1 million. But he was wary: His bid came with a proviso that if the seller could prove there really was another viable offer, he would pay an additional $250,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller complied, with a signed affidavit. Mr. Ruskin, satisfied, closed on the apartment in August at $7.35 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''''I didn't think the market had turned yet,'' said Mr. Ruskin, who had been looking for a New York pied-a-terre for about a year. ''But I thought that if I waited, I might not have the same opportunities again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that buyers tend to become more aggressive if they have already lost a bidding war or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emily Schultz and Wes Mallgren were devastated when they were outbid last June on a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn Heights. The asking price was $412,500, and their offer of $400,000 had been accepted when a higher offer came in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller's broker, Jocelyn G. Turken, an agent at Warburg Realty, asked for final offers, advising both buyers ''to come up with a number that will not overextend you and that won't leave you devastated if you lose, because you know you've given your best shot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Schultz and Mr. Mallgren bid $420,000, but the apartment sold for about $422,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had friends who told us they had gotten their hearts broken, too, but that in the end we would find a better apartment,'' Ms. Schultz said. ''All I could think was: 'No, that was the perfect apartment and now it's gone.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the next time they found an apartment they liked, they made an offer immediately. When the seller demanded $20,000 more, they quickly agreed, only to withdraw the offer when they realized the 550-square-foot apartment was too small for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That was just a psychological mistake,'' Ms. Schultz said. ''We thought we wanted it, but we just really didn't want to lose again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third time was the charm. Ms. Turken helped them find another one-bedroom a few blocks away for $519,000, with a lower maintenance charge than the previous properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wes fell in love with it immediately, but I was more uncomfortable because I didn't want to make another mistake,'' Ms. Schultz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They sat down and made lists of pros and cons. ''We took our time,'' she said. They offered $500,000, and after some negotiation, ended up paying $505,000. Losing the first apartment in a bidding war had come as a surprise to them, Ms. Schultz said, ''but I wasn't worried this time, I just felt good about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They closed and moved into the apartment last month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN many communities, the pace of condominium sales is just crawling along these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You set up an open house, and maybe one person comes,'' said Roberta Baldwin, an agent with Re/Max Village Square Realtors in Montclair. ''Then, you have maybe two or three showings over the course of a month or two.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Montclair-Glen Ridge area alone, she said, there are more than 60 condos for sale -- some new and amenity-rich; others of the older garden-apartment variety with a galley kitchen and a single bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What can we do for the sellers,'' Ms. Baldwin said she was recently asking herself, ''to get people to at least look at these apartments, so when buyers do start making decisions, they will know what's available?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She came up with an answer that seems somewhat revolutionary in the world of brokers: cooperation. Starting last month, she began contacting agents from various brokerages seeking to have their clients' condos included in a ''Condo Crawl'': a mass open house for offerings in Montclair and surrounding towns. Some 35 agents signed up, and the event took place on Nov. 1 from 1 to 4 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advertised in local newspapers, on the community blog Baristanet.com, and via an e-mail ''blast'' from individual agents to their clients, the event drew unexpectedly large crowds to many condos that have been languishing on the market. The average listing received 9 or 10 visitors, while the newer, more expensive places got more than 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same approach was also tried in Summit. In late October, Karen Eastman Bigos, a partner in the Towne Realty Group in Short Hills, organized a cross-agency group showing of units in three large buildings on Euclid Avenue in Summit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As she recalled it, getting other agents on board required some work. ''I said to the other agents: 'Look, nothing is going on here. The market for these older, little one- and two-bedroom condos and co-ops is tough.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 5 of 10 agents whom Ms. Bigos contacted agreed to the group showing, she said. Yet 15 or 20 showings occurred, either during the designated group open house or as a result of e-mail advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Part of what I was trying to accomplish was to familiarize people with a product they might not know about,'' Ms. Bigos said. ''Let's say Mom doesn't want to go into a nursing home, but they stumble on this alternative, and realize: This could work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The location a block from downtown Summit is ideal for older people, who tend to cluster in the roughly 300 units on the block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Montclair area event, brokers paid $35 to have their listings included. Others hitched on to the event, producing handmade signs at the last minute to advertise a particular unit and taping that next to the sign for the Condo Crawl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hey, I'm no dummy,'' said Barbara Rudy, an agent with Montclair Realty, who was showing a two-bedroom two-bath apartment that her mother had occupied on the top floor of a building on Roosevelt Place in Montclair. ''Heard about the Crawl, made a sign and opened the doors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had a steady stream of visitors throughout the day at the apartment, newly listed for $319,000. As at many of the Crawl showings, there was a congeniality otherwise rare in these dour times for apartment real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One home shopper on the balcony of Ms. Rudy's apartment told another that she found the $530 maintenance fee high. ''Plus, there are the property taxes,'' which are currently set at $8,230 a year, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yes, but look at the view,'' said the other woman, ushering her newfound comrade to a corner of the screened-in terrace where the Manhattan skyline was visible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Ms. Rudy was telling visitors that while another unit for sale in the building offered only permit parking in a public lot, her unit came with the ''best parking space in the building,'' in an attached garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the other unit, a one-bedroom listed at $249,900, John Zingali of Zingali Realty described the condo market as ''slow, slow, pretty tough these days,'' but perked up when a crew of six visitors filed through. ''This is good traffic,'' he said with a grin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Real estate used to be sexy,'' Ms. Baldwin said. ''Everyone kept abreast of what was coming on the market and went out on a Sunday afternoon to see and compare. It was a fun thing for the family to do. Maybe you'd have a jogger stop by if the house was near a park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But recently,'' she said, ''real estate has taken on another cast -- glum -- and it's all been serious business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At open houses for the past year, she noted, ''no one wants to give their name. They don't want to sign in, or tell you about themselves -- because these are hard times, and it may not be a fun story.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Crawl allowed people to browse without signing in unless they wished to, and many on the tour clearly took the opportunity just to get a free look at a few distinctive and high-end condos on the list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 6 Kips Ridge in Verona, a 22-year-old town house with four bedrooms, four and a half baths, an elevator and a four-car garage, listed at $997,500, there were a number of wide-eyed lookers. The lavishly finished end unit caused a ''sensation'' among them, according to its agent, Kathryn Lemmer of Coldwell Banker. But it had no immediate takers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither, apparently, did any other property on the tour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Baldwin said her primary goal had been achieved. ''The real point was to get people to feeling comfortable about looking at condos again,'' was how she put it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE house that Michael and Lori Hiller planned to buy in South Park Slope, Brooklyn, was a good size for the neighborhood, and on a pleasant block. But then a problem developed with the building's certificate of occupancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Mrs. Hiller had been the bigger fan of Park Slope, it was Mr. Hiller who had more zest for a new search. He found himself smitten by Ditmas Park, a leafy area of Victorian houses, south of Prospect Park. Eventually, he struck gold, with a 4,000-square-foot six-bedroom house with a finished basement, a backyard and a four-car driveway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hillers saw it on a Sunday, made an offer on Tuesday, and were in contract by week's end. They paid $1.26 million -- $10,000 less than they had planned to pay for the house in Park Slope, which was about half the size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year and a half later, Mr. Hiller said, they are thrilled, partly for the reasons people have always liked Ditmas Park: the grand Victorians, the trees, the big yards and the suburban atmosphere. ''It's just such a great thing to come home and see your kids outside playing,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some of what keeps the Hillers excited about the neighborhood is new. In recent years, a string of popular restaurants have opened on Cortelyou Road, the main business district. These places, among them the Farm on Adderley, Mimi's Hummus and a pioneering cafe called Vox Pop, have drawn visitors to what Time Out New York calls one of the city's best neighborhoods for food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And not only prepared foods, it turns out: the Flatbush Food Co-op, a fixture on Cortelyou, is thriving after its 2008 move into a larger space, and a Sunday farmers' market is also doing well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that word of mouth has made a difference. ''They read about it and they say, 'Well, where is that neighborhood?' '' said Mary Kay Gallagher, a broker who specializes in the area's Victorian houses, and who sold the Hillers their house. ''And then they go on the Internet, and they find me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Web surfers also find a dedicated blog, ditmaspark.blogspot.com, and an Internet group, the Flatbush Family Network, for area parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One result of all the change has been a reinvigorated co-op market, according to Jan Rosenberg, a real estate broker at Brooklyn Hearth Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stefanie Zadravec, a playwright, moved with her husband, Michael McWatters, a freelance Web designer, to a large two-bedroom on Argyle Road days after giving birth to twins. The giant houses are out of their price range, she said, but are wonderful to look at.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had lived in Chelsea, in Manhattan, since 1991, but says her family's new place is bigger than they ever could have afforded there. Also, out on the street, she is constantly running into friends. ''They're the kind of people I had stopped meeting in Manhattan,'' Ms. Zadravec said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through all the change, residents say, the vibes remain positive. ''The older residents of the neighborhood are very excited about the young people who have moved into the neighborhood,'' said Alvin M. Berk, the chairman of Community Board 14, which covers the area. ''It brings the neighborhood vitality. Everybody loves looking at beautiful babies in a baby carriage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ditmas Park is a relatively narrow landmark district bounded by Dorchester Road to the north, Ocean Avenue to the east, Newkirk Avenue to the south and East 16th Street to the west. Yet when most nonpurists refer to Ditmas Park, they are talking about a wider chunk of Victorian Flatbush -- stretching north to Beverley Road, west to Coney Island Avenue and east to Ocean Avenue -- that includes the subsections Ditmas Park West, Beverley Square East and Beverley Square West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What these sections all have in common, besides the loosely applied Ditmas Park name, is Cortelyou Road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the exciting things for me about Cortelyou developing is that it holds together a lot,'' said Ms. Rosenberg, also a founder of the civic group Friends of Cortelyou. ''People think of it as the heart of the neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the area's co-op buildings are concentrated in the blocks immediately south of Cortelyou. The grander houses, mostly single-family, with five or six bedrooms, stretch to the north and south on streets with Anglophile names like Marlborough, Argyle and Westminster. Much of the area was rezoned this summer, Mr. Berk said, to curb out-of-scale construction that had begun to creep up on the area's western edge near Coney Island Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the interior are a few new buildings, but most of the co-op and rental buildings are decades old, some prewar. The blocks full of houses, with their front porches, large yards and driveways, could easily be mistaken for some other, less urban place. Ms. Rosenberg, who has shown the neighborhood to countless newcomers, has heard comparisons to Pittsburgh or Minneapolis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What they're saying is, 'Gee, it doesn't really feel like New York,' '' she said. ''And it doesn't. For a lot of people it feels like home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ms. Gallagher used to talk about Victorian house prices early this decade, she spoke of the approach to the million-dollar mark. That barrier has long since been leapfrogged, and prices for Victorians are now routinely $900,000 and up, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Aviva Sucher, a broker at Brooklyn Dwellings, says that in the softer economy, there are relative bargains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are houses as low as $800,000,'' she said. ''We haven't seen these kinds of numbers in, I'd say, well over 10 years. Right now, there are very well-priced homes for buyers who would not have been able to come into the area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For co-ops, Ms. Rosenberg said buyers should expect to pay $250,000 to $320,000 for a one-bedroom -- occasionally less. Two-bedrooms, she said, range from around $300,000 to $450,000 for very large units like Ms. Zadravec's, which also includes an office. There are almost no three-bedroom co-ops, Ms. Rosenberg said, and few condos of any size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rentals can be hard to come by. Units in detached houses are priced unpredictably, with some sprawling apartments over $2,000 a month, and tighter attic spaces well below that. In apartment buildings, one-bedrooms rent for around $1,400, while two-bedrooms are in the $1,700 range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two public elementary schools. Public School 139, on Rugby Road just north of Cortelyou, has around 1,100 students in prekindergarten through fifth grade. It received an A on its most recent city progress report, with 68.1 percent of students meeting standards in English language arts and 88.8 percent in math. P.S. 217 on Newkirk Avenue also serves prekindergarten through fifth grade, and has around 1,200 students. It, too, got an A on its progress report, with 76.9 percent of students meeting standards in language arts and 94.1 percent in math.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Berk said both schools had so far been able to accommodate their swelling numbers, although P.S. 217 had to build an annex. Both, he said, have active parents' associations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood's middle-schoolers attend Junior High School 62, which has around 1,100 students, on Cortelyou Road in nearby Kensington. The school received an A on its city progress report, with 59.1 percent testing at or above grade level in language arts, and 70.3 percent in math.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A nearby high school, Midwood High, is a few blocks south of the neighborhood at Brooklyn College. The former Erasmus Hall High School, which was broken up into four smaller schools in 1994, is a few blocks north of the neighborhood on Flatbush Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighborhood life is sedate and suburban. The Parade Grounds at the southern tip ofProspect Park are within walking distance, as is the park's running and cycling loop. At night, the restaurants on Cortelyou -- and off, in the case of Pomme de Terre, a newer place on Newkirk Avenue -- are popular destinations. Residents trade gossip on just-opened and soon-to-open restaurants and bars, and on Sundays head to the farmers' market and playground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It gives Cortelyou Road a ''village square feel on Sunday morning,'' Mr. Berk said. ''People get together and meet each other and buy rutabaga.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Q train runs through the middle of the neighborhood, stopping at Beverley Road, Cortelyou Road and Newkirk Avenue. The B train, which runs express through Brooklyn, also stops at Newkirk. The Q becomes an express train once it enters Manhattan, making the trip into Midtown a relatively quick one, considering the distance. If you time the trains right, Mr. Hiller said, you can be there in half an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ditmas Park, like the rest of Victorian Flatbush, was developed early in the 20th century. In 1908, according to the Encyclopedia of New York City, the Ditmas Park Association was formed, and enacted zoning to preserve the neighborhood. The Ditmas Park Historic District was created in the 1980s.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ERICA FRIEDMAN had a checklist. She knew exactly what she needed in her new home, and the importance of every feature. She went through her list methodically, dismissing buildings that didn't make the cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She could get a strong idea of a place without even visiting. All salient information -- floor plans, photos, renderings, maps -- was available online. ''You even know what the faucets will be like,'' said Dr. Friedman, who is a rheumatologist. And she has an uncanny ability to visualize space. As for those things she couldn't control or predict -- well, they weren't worth worrying about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was able to define what was critical for me,'' Dr. Friedman said. ''Some of the specifics had to do with location and finances, which you don't have to walk into a building for. A lot had to do with amenities, which are either there or not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Friedman, 54, originally from the suburbs of Philadelphia, attended Jefferson Medical College there. She met her husband when both were medical students. Later, with a son, a daughter and a dog, they moved to Chappaqua for the sake of space and schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After her divorce a decade ago, Dr. Friedman and the children -- Noah Asch, now 20, and Rebecca Asch, now 19 -- moved to a smaller house near the center of Chappaqua. Six years ago, her widowed father, Robert Friedman, now 87, joined them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Friedman, who is also an associate dean at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, commuted via <span class="companylink">Metro-North Railroad</span> to the 125th Street station. From there, if she had time, she would walk to her office on 100th Street near Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eager to rid herself of the lengthy trip and high suburban property taxes, she planned to move to Manhattan as soon as Rebecca finished high school in 2008. ''I was tired of owning and having to manage'' a house, Dr. Friedman said. ''I wanted someone to take care of it for me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The things she focused on in her search: price, size, location -- and a swimming pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her limit was a little more than $1 million, which meant an outlay of $5,500 a month maximum. That amount was ''kind of restrictive'' for three bedrooms, she said. She needed bedrooms for her father and for Noah, an art student.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living within walking distance of work ''was critical after spending 15 years of my life two and a half hours a day on public transportation,'' Dr. Friedman said. For several years, she had train buddies -- four or five women who commuted together in the morning. The group slowly disbanded as the others changed jobs. ''It was wonderful when I had that, and horrible after I didn't, because it became just a ride again,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Friedman, who began swimming in medical school and found it ''an incredible stress relief,'' knew it was a stretch to expect a pool. If need be, she would settle for one nearby. She loved the Web site nybits.com, which allows for easy sorting by building details. A list of buildings with pools came right up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Places south of Mount Sinai were unaffordable, so she hunted to the east and north. She cast her eye on One Carnegie Hill, on East 96th Street, and its pool. But three-bedrooms there were simply too costly, starting around $1.6 million, with a common charge of nearly $2,500 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She could, however, afford Harlem. The new condominium buildings there typically included all the expected amenities -- doorman, elevator, gym, roof deck and garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it were just me, I would not have a car,'' she said. But she decided to keep her father's car ''for his emotional well-being.'' In the suburbs, it was hard to stop him from driving, and she worried that he might get into an accident. She knew that moving to the city -- where she would be the driver -- would solve the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her favorite Harlem condo building, 111 Central Park North, was the one she couldn't afford. Three-bedrooms started around $2 million. The building lacked a pool, too, and there was little activity in the immediate neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But 5th on the Park -- overlooking Marcus Garvey Park -- had everything on Dr. Friedman's list. When she decided on the building two years ago, it was in the early stages of construction. That gave her dozens of apartments to choose from. She wanted one just above treetop level, with a bedroom facing east so she could awaken to morning light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get a full picture of a home, Dr. Friedman said, you must visit at different times of day, week and year. ''You never know,'' she said, because any situation could ''change in a heartbeat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no guarantee the best neighbor in the world is not going to drop dead running the marathon or lose their job or have a divorce or a baby,'' she said. ''For the things you can't control for, you let go. I am incredibly tolerant of other people's lives, as long as they don't harm anyone else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She signed a contract for a three-bedroom two-bath condo of 1,500 square feet, sight unseen. It would even fit her baby grand piano -- a benefit for her boyfriend, Tim Nichols, who has returned to school to study music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It cost $1.15 million, with monthly charges of just over $700, plus $40,000 for a parking spot. Her total monthly outlay is in the high $4,000 range. The timing seemed perfect, with the building scheduled for completion just as Rebecca graduated. (She is now at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Friedman sold the Chappaqua house for about $640,000. Then the delays began. She and the children moved to the basement of a friend's house in Chappaqua for $2,100 a month. Her father lived with her sister. For a chaotic year, she waited. (Sixty-two of the building's 159 units remain unsold.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she was finally able to enter the building, she fretted. It seemed so small. Had her vaunted visual abilities failed her?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People say places look bigger with furniture,'' she said. ''It makes no sense to me.'' But she found it true when she arrived in late summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now there is a pool delay, involving power to the filtration system. Dr. Friedman continues to wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, she enjoys walking to work and taking her father, in the car, on weekly trips to Fairway. In her lively neighborhood, people recognize her on the street. On one stretch, a neighbor told her there was only one house for the postman to deliver to, but ''now there is a whole row of new construction,'' she said. ''I would like to see a few of the deserted lots go away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had she not found 5th on the Park, she might not have moved, she said. ''There were a lot of things I couldn't compromise on. I got lucky. I was able to meet every criterion.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gladstone, 57, is the chief executive of Madison Equities, started by his parents, which has developed a wide range of buildings in Manhattan. Its most recent developments are two condominiums: Chelsea Modern and 57 Irving Place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How's business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Business is pretty good. Everything that we're building right now is for the superwealthy crowd. So we're lucky that we're working for a market that is less hurt by the international crisis. When you're dealing in rarefied real estate, the apartment that they're going to buy from you costs less than the art they're going to put up on the walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Are you finding that even these buyers are more cautious?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Buyers of apartments are far more discerning. For example, in our 57 Irving Place project there's no market of people buying from plans; they want to see a finished building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that building, there are only nine units -- and I'm taking one of them -- and we have contracts out, but basically everyone is saying, we'd like to see a representation of how the lobby is going to look, we want to see the apartment a little further along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How is it coming along?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The building is still under construction. We will be able to show all the finishes by Thanksgiving, so we're getting there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Any famous buyers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Can you name anyone?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We are encouraging everybody to sign contracts in the name of a corporation, because in this city you can learn who's in the building and it makes it uncomfortable for everyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What are the asking prices?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The cheapest apartment is on the third floor, at $6.75 million, and that is for 3,000 square feet, three bedrooms expandable to a fourth. A penthouse triplex that is roughly 7,000 square feet and has a swimming pool is $18 million. There are two people interested. Numbers are being discussed, but I don't think the final price will be $18 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How were sales at your other condominium, the less pricey Chelsea Modern?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It's all sold or rented -- we rented the last 12 or so units in six weeks -- but it's 100 percent occupied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Why did you decide to rent?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It's a 47-unit building, and 10 people couldn't close. There are some apartments I will not sell at a discount in this marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We rented apartments for one and two years, and we'll sell them in the future. We did sell some at Chelsea Modern at 15 percent off, and then we paid off our loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Are you bullish on the condo market?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. There are no tower cranes -- there's no product coming on the market. So now would be a very wise time for somebody to buy an occupied unit to prepare for the future, because in one year prices will be significantly higher than they are today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. And your outlook for hotels?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Very, very strong. New York is underroomed. We are the most highly visited city in the world, and we have less rooms than Chicago, Orlando or Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our next project is 145 Perry Street, which is a 58-key bed-and-breakfast inn. It's the love of my life -- I've wanted to do that for a very long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Are you O.K. with your company's debt level?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We never take leverage greater than 75 percent. On 57 Irving, we are slightly above 50 percent equity. As a developer, I make less out of the deal if there's more equity in it, but we don't sweat so hard if things are bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Tell me about your first job in this industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. My parents started a contracting business and then they went into development. So as a teenager I did carpentry work some summers. This was a time when New York construction workers were beating up the long hairs, and I was one of those long hairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Did you not get along?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I got along great with the men, but they used to tease me. I was once pinned down on a pile of Sheetrock and they started to cut my hair with the Sheetrock snips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Ever get hurt on the job?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The screw gun short-circuited and I cut off my fingertips. It was nobody's fault. They took me to N.Y.U. hospital, where a famous microsurgeon sewed my fingertips back on. I couldn't play guitar for four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My mother came to pick me up and as I opened up the cab door, the Paul Simon song ''Lincoln Duncan'' was playing. The last verse of it was: ''I was playing my guitar and lying underneath the stars. Just thanking the Lord for my fingers.'' Very spooky.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you live in the Bay Area, you hardly need reminding that you pay more for your home than most people. The region has the dubious honor of ranking No. 1 nationally in median home value, median monthly mortgage costs and median gross rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRICE The median price paid for a Bay Area home is $365,000, compared with $177,900 nationally. That regional median price peaked at $665,000 in June 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Urban Land Institute's new Bay Area Burden report offers more of the figures behind the general sense of being overstretched: almost 20 percent of all Bay Area homeowners spend more than half of their income on housing -- far exceeding the national average of 12 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, these households spend more than $28,000 annually on housing -- about 39 percent of the area median income, the report said. Three-fifths of local residents live in communities unaffordable to households earning less than $80,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SALES New sales figures show an increase in the area's two biggest urban concentrations, at a time of year when one would expect a dip. The number of existing single family homes sold in San Jose in the month ended Oct. 15 was 764, up 12 percent from that period in 2008, according to MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>. In San Francisco, there was an 18.5 percent jump with 282 sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in Oakland, where one expects less buoyancy, existing home sales slipped just 3.5 percent, to 276 from 286, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>'s analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates as well as lower prices help explain the strong numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In more hard-hit communities, government assistance has helped increase home sales, particularly among first-time buyers. Lending on about half of all homes bought in Martinez (51.2 percent), Brentwood (50.6 percent) and Antioch (50.3 percent) is insured by the Federal Housing Administration. In Oakley, it is 65 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FORECLOSURES The foreclosure statistics tell another story, and the most notable trend is a discernible increase in the number of distressed homes at the higher end of the market. In San Francisco, where the median home price is $650,000 (compared with $365,000 for the Bay Area as a whole), there has been a significant rise in the number of default notices: 180 in the month ended Oct. 15, compared with 34 in the same period last year. Mountain View, Palo Alto and Danville have also had sharp rises in defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major cause is the resetting of ''exotic'' mortgages, those with low upfront interest rates. Plunging home values, and reduced availability of the jumbo mortgages, which make refinancing possible, have left many high-end homeowners facing significant monthly payment increases.</p>

</div><div class="author">By SUSAN STELLIN   </div><div>1475 words</div><div>13 November 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>35</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A map in the Escapes pages on Nov. 13 with an article about time shares in New York and other cities misidentified the location of Carnegie Hall. It is on West 57th Street at Seventh Avenue, not West 56th Street. The map also misidentified a Midtown street; the street labeled West 52nd Street is West 53rd Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Wed Dec 09 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE is a new building on West 57th Street in Manhattan, a block from Bulgari and <span class="companylink">Bergdorf Goodman</span> on Fifth Avenue, and about the same distance to Central Park and Carnegie Hall. Walking by, it looks like many of the luxury apartment projects that have recently sprouted in the city, with glass windows reaching up 28 stories, a fitness center visible from the street and well-dressed doormen in the lobby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except the building offers neither condominiums nor rental apartments -- just time shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project, West 57th Street by Hilton Club, which opened in July, is not the first time-share building to stake out ground in New York City. The Manhattan Club, a few blocks away on West 56th Street, has been welcoming guests since 1996. But the Hilton property is the first building in Manhattan built as a time share, designed to appeal to a new generation of buyers, with amenities like iPod docking stations, Japanese soaking tubs and hardwood floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also represents a bet that urban time shares can expand the vacation ownership concept beyond beach destinations like Florida and Hawaii, appealing to regional residents who regularly come to the city to shop, eat out and see a Broadway show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a market for urban time shares, because people like to go to gateway cities,'' said Kim Kreiger, a senior vice president with Hilton Grand Vacations Company, a division of <span class="companylink">Hilton Hotels</span> that operates time-share properties around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hilton tested the Manhattan market in 2002 by converting two floors of its hotel on the Avenue of the Americas into 78 time-share units, called the Hilton Club. Those units sold out ahead of schedule, Mr. Kreiger said, so the company began looking for a site to build a dedicated time-share property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The West 57th Street project has 161 units, which are sold by the week, ranging from a $33,900 studio to a $125,000 penthouse. Annual maintenance fees, based on the size of the unit, are $900 to $1,200. By comparison, the Manhattan Club has 286 units, priced between $29,500 and $50,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Manhattan Club feels a bit more like a traditional hotel -- which it once was -- with a concierge desk in the lobby and a rack of brochures promoting musicals and tours. But the arrival of another time share in the neighborhood may actually help validate the urban concept, said Michael Heller, the Manhattan Club's vice president for sales and marketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody said urban time shares don't work,'' Mr. Heller said. ''Well, it certainly did, and that's why you see competition coming on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it may seem like an inopportune time to be selling real estate in Manhattan, sales at Hilton's West 57th Street property, once the site of a <span class="companylink">Horn &amp; Hardart</span> Automat, began in 2007, and about half of the available weeks are already sold, Mr. Kreiger said. But he said the recession had resulted in more modest price increases this year than originally planned, as well as fewer foreign buyers than expected and slower sales at the lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvey and Myrna Lederman are among West 57th Street's initial owners; they bought four weeks at the property after trying out Hilton's first Manhattan time share in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We love the city, and we like to be here as much as we can,'' said Dr. Lederman, a podiatrist from Bloomfield, Conn. He and his wife spend a week in the city in June, another week in December, and celebrate their anniversary, Valentine's Day and other special occasions in the city, so owning a time share has given them something of a part-time pied-a-terre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We live in a beautiful part of Connecticut,'' he said. ''Our roots are there. And yet we can come down here often, so we have the best of both worlds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the Ledermans most buyers live within 200 miles of the city, and owners can break up their week into stays of as little as just one night. Each week is measured in points, which can be traded for stays at other Hilton Grand Vacations properties in places like Las Vegas; Los Cabos, Mexico; or Miami Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those types of sun-and-sea destinations still account for the vast majority of time-share properties. Urban locations represent just 7 percent of the market, according to a 2008 industry study by <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span>. But with more time-share operators adopting a point system with the flexibility to visit different destinations, and travel patterns shifting toward shorter trips, urban time shares are becoming a more viable option for developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot more people traveling to metropolitan areas that are closer to where they live,'' said Adam Schwartz, a senior vice president with Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which has 20 urban properties out of about 150 time-share locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most recently the company converted two San Francisco hotels into a 115-unit time-share property that opened in June near Union Square; it is Wyndham's second location in San Francisco. Other urban destinations include Alexandria, Va.; Atlantic City; Las Vegas; New Orleans; San Antonio; San Diego; and Seattle, as well as a property at National Harbor near Washington, due to open in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another landmark urban time share is the Custom House in Boston by Marriott Vacation Club, a historic building where ship captains used to pay their taxes; Marriott turned it into an 84-unit time share in 1997. Current prices for the one-bedroom suites range from $24,000 to $28,000, with maintenance fees around $800 year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Marriott has considered developing a time share in New York City, the real estate boom made finding a good location a challenge, said Ed Kinney, a vice president with Marriott Vacation Club International, though an opportunity might present itself down the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The real estate environment is changing dramatically,'' Mr. Kinney said, ''and people are looking to repurpose buildings. It may be more cost effective once again, after the economy sorts itself out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, one of the hurdles for urban time shares has been the high price of property in the metropolitan markets that draw visitors year round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a concept that works in a limited number of destinations,'' said Scott Berman, a hospitality analyst at <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>, and himself a time-share owner in Colorado. Mr. Berman cited New York, Boston, San Francisco and potentially London, Paris and Rome as among the most viable locations for urban time shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it may turn out that some cities actually prove to be too popular, at least for people trying to exchange points. (Owners at a particular location typically get first dibs for reservations.) Peggy Rusnak, a time-share owner since 1987, said she had not yet been able to use her Wyndham points to book stays in San Francisco and New Orleans, partly because her job made it hard to plan ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've tried to get into them, but I always wait until the last minute,'' Ms. Rusnak said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a year of ultimatums, threats and stop-and-go talks, the Bloomberg administration has agreed to pay $95.6 million to a developer for seven acres in the heart of Coney Island, according to executives on both sides of the negotiations. It is a crucial step forward for the city's vision of turning the faded and mostly dormant seaside amusement district into an exciting destination reminiscent of its heyday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's deal with the developer, Joseph J. Sitt, capped a long standoff between the two sides, with each claiming it had the best plan for the revival of the fabled playground, but neither able to bring its plan to fruition in a deadly real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city will announce the deal on Thursday, but the reality of a revived Coney Island remains a long way off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sitt began buying land in Coney Island in 2005, evicting tenants and promising a modern, Las Vegas-style resort with hotels and condominiums among the rides. Today, much of the land sits vacant. While the Cyclone roller coaster, the Wonder Wheel and Nathan's hot dog stand remain, the Thunderbolt, Child's restaurant and even the Astroland amusement park are gone -- cleared away for new ventures that were never built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summer, with Mr. Sitt and the city in heated negotiations, neither side wanted to be accused of stunting the area's growth, so each brought in competing attractions. City Hall had Ringling Brothers open a circus tent, and Mr. Sitt unveiled a tent colony of sideshows. The tents are now empty, torn by the November winds that sweep across the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't look good,'' Dick Zigun, who runs the Coney Island Museum and the annual Mermaid Parade, said of the area. He said he was hopeful that the city ''is as good as its word.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each side claimed victory, though no one wanted to comment for the record before Thursday's announcement. While Mr. Sitt got much less than the $140 million he had wanted for 10.5 of the 12.5 acres he owned, the $95.6 million for 6.9 acres came to more than $300 a square foot -- a huge amount in the current market. Mr. Sitt, chief executive of Thor Equities, plans to develop hotels and stores on his remaining 5.6 acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials did say that in the next few days they would begin soliciting offers for an interim amusement operator before seeking potential developers to create a year-round destination, which would ideally include a diverse mix of thrill rides, games and attractions between the Cyclone and the <span class="companylink">KeySpan</span> ballpark. As a first step, the administration is sending representatives to the annual convention of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions in Las Vegas next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city now has the opportunity to entice a range of operators whose competing visions would make for a dynamic Coney Island, rather than a single vision that turns Coney Island into an amusement mall, said Michael Immerso, author of ''Coney Island, the People's Playground.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sitt founded the Ashley Stewart plus-size clothing chain, and his company controls about 12 million square feet of retail, hotel and commercial property in cities across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sitt often abandoned his high school classes in Brooklyn to spend time in Coney Island. His proposal called for a $1.5 billion Las Vegas-style resort with a huge glass-enclosed water park, wild rides, many stores and condominiums or time-share hotels in tall towers near the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he clashed with city officials, who said that housing in the amusement district would inevitably conflict with the flashing lights, clanging and dinging of the rides. In 2007, Deputy Mayor Robert C. Lieber described Mr. Sitt's scheme as a ''wolf dressed up as a sheep.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sitt's land, however, was key to the city's redevelopment plan, because it sat in the heart of the amusement and entertainment district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, Mr. Lieber offered $110 million for 10.5 acres of Mr. Sitt's property, saying the price would go down if the deal was not accepted immediately. Mr. Sitt, who had asked for more than $140 million, went on vacation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the city offered $105 million. ''The bottom line is we can only pay so much,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the summer, the city rezoned a 19-block area of Coney Island, including a 27-acre amusement and entertainment district and, to the north and west of the district, almost 5,000 apartments and 500,000 square feet of retail. Given the deadlock and Mr. Sitt's eviction of many tenants, neither side wanted to be blamed for the final decimation of the Coney Island amusements -- hence this summer's competing attractions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $95.6 million covers 6.9 acres, most of it along the Boardwalk, between the Cyclone and <span class="companylink">KeySpan</span> Park , including the former home of Astroland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's plan bars residential development within the amusement district east of the ballpark and south of Surf Avenue. Yet, it does provide for the development of up to 4,500 new apartments, with 840 set aside for low- and moderate-income tenants. On the six blocks west of the ballpark in what the city now calls Coney West, developers could erect as many as 2,700 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, up to 1,800 apartments can be built in Coney North, five blocks on the north side of Surf Avenue, between Stillwell Avenue and West 20th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One residential developer, <span class="companylink">Taconic Investment Partners</span>, controls about 10 acres where it could build 2,000 apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the city made a good choice in buying the land in order to protect the area along the boardwalk for amusements forever,'' said Dennis Vourderis, who family runs the only amusement park left, Dino's, and the Wonder Wheel, a city landmark. ''It won't be threatened by the development of apartments, shopping malls or anything else. Now the question is, Who do we bring in to build this billion-dollar amusement park?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Juan Rivero, a spokesman for Save Coney Island, a community group that has been critical of both Mr. Sitt's and the city's plans, said that even though only amusements would be allowed in the special district, apartments and high-rise hotels up to 27 stories would be allowed right next to it. He worried that this proximity could ''permanently compromise Coney Island's potential to once again become a world-class destination.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sitt has done very well buying but not building things in Brooklyn. In 2005, he bought a parcel west of the amusement district for $13 million and sold it 14 months later for $90 million. He also bought the Albee Square Mall in Downtown Brooklyn for $25 million in 2001, vowing to renovate. He sold it in 2007 for $125 million, without the makeover.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ANNE BARNARD; Rebecca White contributed reporting.   </div><div>713 words</div><div>10 November 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>31</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a fire in an illegal basement residence killed three men in Woodside, Queens, on Saturday came the refrain from borough residents: Not again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the block of modest wood-frame houses on 65th Street where the fire broke out to the leafy eastern edge of the borough, residents lament that tenants crammed into illegal apartments are a persistent problem that grinds down the quality of life every day, but gets attention only when it becomes fatal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not just about taxing sewer lines and overcrowding in schools and parking,'' Corey Bearak, the president of the Queens Civic Congress, an umbrella group of local associations, said on Monday. ''Ultimately, what happens with these fires, it manifests itself in people dying, and it's absolutely outrageous.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lax building-code enforcement, a dearth of affordable housing and a lack of tax incentives to promote owner occupancy create a temptation for landlords and tenants alike to conceal illegal housing situations, Mr. Bearak said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worst of all, residents say, illegal conversions are so common that people feel powerless to curb them -- and some tenants who lived in illegal units said they had not even realized they were living in dangerous quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Woodside, homeowners and tenants said it was well known that many houses on the block where the fire broke out had ''extra rooms'' in their basements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There had been complaints twice before about the house that burned, at 42-40 65th Street. The Department of Buildings received complaints in 1990 and 2004; inspectors went to the scene both times but found no violations, said Tony Sclafani, a department spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was ''no evidence of misconduct'' by the inspectors, he said, but the agency was investigating the inspection history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday, firefighters were delayed in reaching the victims by an obstructed basement door, and they had to cut through bars on the basement windows, a fire official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Buildings Department evacuated 1,086 illegally converted apartments in 2008, up from 823 in 2007 and 738 in 2006, Mr. Sclafani said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Saturday's fire, the buildings officials discovered eight illegal single-occupancy rooms next door at 42-38 65th Street, across a driveway from the fire scene, and evacuated all of them, Mr. Sclafani said. He called on anyone who knew of other violations to come forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane Ross, 51, and her fiance, Jeffrey Folk, 50, were among the tenants of those illegal rooms. ''I assumed everything was legitimate,'' Mr. Folk said. ''I had no idea that it was illegal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't know,'' Ms. Ross said. ''Where are we going to go? It makes me angry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A man who answered the door at the house, and identified himself as the landlord but refused to give his name for fear of a run-in with the authorities, said he charged $107 rent for the rooms, which he said were already subdivided when his family bought the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ronne Barua, whose father, Subir, owns the house that burned, said his family had also bought the house with existing subdivisions. He declined to say if he knew they were illegal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subir Barua was hospitalized in critical condition after the fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fire officials are investigating how much time elapsed between the discovery of the fire and the call to 911, said Jim Long, a department spokesman. Landlords with illegal units sometimes try to put out fires themselves, officials say, rather than immediately calling 911.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing advocates estimate that there are more than 100,000 units of illegally converted housing in the city. Queens has by far the most of any borough, with 48,000, according to a report by the Pratt Center for Community Development and Chhaya Community Development Corporation, a housing advocacy group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, a fire in an illegally converted home in Elmhurst, Queens, killed three children and an 80-year-old man; a similar Queens fire killed a mother and two children in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buildings Department officials say it is not always easy to catch violators. Many landlords have learned to avoid telltale signs like multiple mailboxes and doorbells. And the department needs a warrant to enter a house against a landlord's will.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sea Cliff -- STEVE TANDY is ready for brand-new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twelve years ago, Mr. Tandy was living in a 1912 caretaker's cottage in Glen Cove, but he wanted something different. ''I didn't want to come home and have the same house as everyone else on the block,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mr. Tandy, a mortgage banker, bought the Woodshed, a grand 1890 Victorian ''painted lady'' with classic Gothic-style architecture that is on the local, state and national registers of historic places. It occupies its own entire block in Sea Cliff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As owners of historic homes often do, he worked ''two solid years and sporadically for the next 10'' renovating the monumental four-story 18-room house with its gabled slate roof and spire, large overhangs, forest-green and barn-red gingerbread trim, 80 caramel-colored wooden shutters and wraparound porch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gas sconces in the foyer are working; the parquet floors with walnut inlay in the entry foyer, installed during the Depression to give local craftsmen a job, are polished; the original pulled-plaster moldings are seamless; the plaster walls smooth; and the six-burner coal stove from the original basement kitchen still in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tandy redid the first-floor kitchen, using its 1930s stove, with cabinets fashioned from leftover wainscoting in the attic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Old houses always need a little T.L.C.,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, now married and the father of three, he seeks to pass the baton to a new owner and move into ''something a little more manageable,'' possibly ''new construction, so I don't have to worry about it for 20 years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, Mr. Tandy put his historic abode, which was the setting for the 1981 Bette Davis television movie ''Family Reunion,'' on the market. The asking price is $1.749 million, and the agent is Terry Sciubba, owner of Sherlock Homes Realty. ''Something like the Woodshed only comes on the market three times in 100 years,'' Ms. Sciubba said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, for those who crave a historic house -- along with all the charms and challenges it can entail -- there are a few other architectural gems to be found across the Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a different price point, there is the Gold Coast mansion La Selva in Upper Brookville, a 1915 Mediterranean-style 40-room stucco villa on 25 acres, which can be had for $14.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed by Hunt &amp; Hunt for Henry Sanderson, a banking and rail executive, it was used until 2001 by the Roman Catholic Church as the St. Francis Retreat House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last five years it has been refurbished, though never lived in, by its latest owner, Sylvia Kumar, whose husband, Sanjay, the former Computer Associates chief executive, is in prison for accounting fraud that cost shareholders in his company more than $400 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been reduced from $16.99 million after a year and a half on the market, said Tony Bellissimo, the property manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mansion has a domed rotunda with a winding travertine staircase, a vaulted entry hall with carved stone walls, Palladian arches, embellished fireplaces, Renaissance paintings built into the walls, coffered ceilings, patterned marble floors and intricately carved wooden doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arlene Travis, the co-producer of Mansions &amp; Millionaires, a company that organizes North Shore show houses, has a showcase at La Selva through Nov. 15. Describing the mansion as ''truly legendary,'' she said that in preparing the showcase her designers had not disturbed its historical features but had strived to show that ''yesterday's architecture is compatible with today's lifestyle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul J. Mateyunas, the author of ''North Shore Long Island: Country Houses 1890-1950'' (Acanthus Press, 2007) and a restoration consultant and agent with Daniel Gale <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> International in Locust Valley, sees an increased demand for old estate houses among young families on the North Shore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In size and height, ''you can't build on the scale these houses were built,'' he said, pointing out that much new construction, albeit smaller, is modeled on such homes. ''These houses can be versatile and you can keep the integrity as well as update them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another unusual house is on the market in Bay Shore: a Moorish-style bayside villa built in 1912 on 1.26 acres by Raphael Guastavino Jr., who along with his father and their Guastavino Tile Company helped to create Grand Central Terminal and Carnegie Hall. The asking price is $1.895 million, said Bonnie Williamson, an agent with Daniel Gale. The interior has vaulted arches, a turquoise staircase and, as one might imagine, extensive tile work. Whoever ultimately buys the house, Ms. Williamson said, ''has to be someone who wants the architectural history and the integrity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westhampton Beach, Len and Kathryn Conway, the owners of Seafield Estate, a shingled manor, recently dropped their asking price $10 million, to $29 million, after the house spent a year on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 16,000-square-foot 24-room house was designed in 1903 for William C. Atwater, a coal baron, by the architect Henry Bacon, who was known for his design of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. It has an entry with a three-story staircase, as well as a banquet-size formal dining room with murals and a fireplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was in a state of relative neglect when they bought it in 1994, said Mr. Conway, an entrepreneur. He declined to reveal the price they paid, but said they had spent two years doing a full renovation -- removing old wooden beams, raising the height of ceilings, installing more expansive moldings and combining rooms to create bedroom suites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You wouldn't be able to recreate it,'' Mr. Conway said, ''and if you tried to replace it, to do it modern, but keeping with the details that are there, it would be at least $1,000 a square foot'' -- and that's not counting the 10.4 waterfront acres.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ONE Madison Park, the soaring 600-foot glass condominium that towers over East 23rd Street, opened to its first residents in August, but since then only five buyers have closed, according to city records. Other would-be buyers have walked away -- raising questions, brokers at several firms said, about the prospects for the building in a depressed real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week the developers, Ira J. Shapiro and Marc Jacobs, confirmed that one of the largest buyers in the building had changed his mind. The buyer, Paul Davies, a British interior designer who was in contract to buy three upper floors in the 50-story building for $31 million, was given at least some of his deposit back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lawyer, Richard N. Cohen, said he had negotiated a settlement on behalf of two other would-be buyers, both Wall Street executives, who were unable to close on two apartments worth a total of $5 million. But after the buyers signed deals for a return of a ''substantial portion of the deposits,'' he said, the sponsor backed out of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cohen said the sponsor indicated the mortgage holders had refused to go along, perhaps raising a question about the project's financing. But a spokesman for the sponsor said that the mortgage holder, <span class="companylink">iStar Financial</span>, a publicly traded real estate investment trust with a $238.5 million mortgage on the project, was ''fully supportive'' and had continued to pay for ongoing construction expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Streeteasy.com shows 67 apartments at One Madison Park in contract, 16 on the market and only 5 units closed (though the sponsor said two more had closed but were not yet listed in public records). Brokers who have followed the building have long been skeptical of the number of units in contract, and have contended that some of them were sold to the listing brokers and their friends and family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building is listed with Wendy Maitland and Wilbur Gonzalez, brokers at Brown Harris Stevens. The brokerage is conducting a wide-ranging review, including whether commissions were paid on sales and purchases by its brokers in the building, brokers at other firms said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail message, Ms. Maitland confirmed that she had bought one apartment at One Madison Park, closed on it and resold it. Mr. Gonzalez said he was in contract to buy an apartment but had not closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I bought one apartment at whatever market price was at the time, as is common in the industry,'' Ms. Maitland said, ''and I've since sold it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gonzalez said Brown Harris Stevens ''gets 30 percent of all our commissions without exception.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail message, Amy Gotzler, director of communications at Brown Harris Stevens, said the firm ''is meeting with the developers of One Madison Park as part of Brown Harris Stevens's evaluation of its role in the project,'' and added, ''We believe no Brown Harris Stevens agent sales were done without the developers' consent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several brokers said the building had been reaching out in recent days to brokers at other firms for their views on marketing the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers at many buildings in New York City have been trying to wriggle out of contracts now that prices have fallen sharply. When the first apartment closed at One Madison Park on Aug. 14, Ms. Maitland said the closing had beaten a deadline that would have given buyers the right to rescind that contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lawyers have been going over offering plans, and Mr. Cohen said that a discrepancy in the plan seemed to set the deadline at Aug. 1 at the latest, giving all buyers a chance to rescind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Davies is a shrewd investor who nearly doubled his money when he sold a London town house to Madonna. Shaun Osher, the founder of Core Group Marketing, which helped Mr. Davies find the $31 million apartment, said he backed out because ''the market did an about turn.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He didn't want to be exposed right now for a piece of real estate that is now worth $18 million,'' Mr. Osher said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a spokesman for the sponsor said that a duplex unit making up two floors of Mr. Davies's purchase was now in contract again ''at an equal purchase price'' with a closing expected in January.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ITS seven miles of waterfront afford striking views of storms barreling across the widest portion of the Hudson River -- which is what makes Croton-on-Hudson the closest thing Silvana Cappabianca has found to her childhood home on the Adriatic Sea. For her husband, Claudio, the river at moonrise stirs memories of his first home in Naples, on the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes, it's the sun setting and turning the clouds a reddish purple that takes our breath away,'' said Mr. Cappabianca, a retired banker who has lived with his wife, a high school teacher, at Half Moon Bay condominiums along the river for more than 13 years. When they moved from Nassau County, they paid about $350,000 for their three-bedroom three-bathroom duplex home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Other times it's the silvery colors of the moon reflected on the water,'' Mr. Cappabianca said. ''But most of all, after a storm has passed and the hill contours can be seen again, the clear definition of the views of countryside is sharper than anything you could see, even on HDTV.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-square-mile village is about 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, at the confluence of the Croton and Hudson Rivers, which form its southern and western boundaries. Directly to the north lies a section of the town of Cortlandt, of which the village is a part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water is Croton's most precious commodity -- the two rivers offer recreational and aesthetic benefits, while aquifers produce high-quality drinking water. The village, which is considered to have some of Westchester County's best-tasting water, pumps close to two million gallons a day, depending on the season, to its almost 8,000 residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Croton's Hudson River shoreline is the only waterfront in Westchester that is totally accessible to residents, according to Abraham J. Zambrano, the village manager. Even the private Half Moon Bay condo complex has a section set aside as a public village walkway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zambrano also said the waterfront area was one of the few in Westchester with ''not a single remnant left from its industrial past,'' apart from the railroad tracks that run along the river.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 19th century, farming, shipping, shipbuilding and brick manufacturing were the major industries. The railroad and construction of the Croton and New Croton Dams and the New Croton Aqueduct also provided employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowadays, businesses are in much shorter supply -- and that lack is spurring an effort to enlarge the tax base by revitalizing the small commercial district near the train station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The village's Board of Trustees has proposed allowing owners of 19 one-story buildings to add second and third floors for residential and some office use. The idea is that owners could use parts of the street floor for their own businesses and live above them, or rent or sell commercial and residential space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure is not necessarily welcome news to some residents who worry about overburdening the school system and detracting from the village's natural beauties: the waterfront with sailboats gliding by; the children at play in the parks; the clear drinking water from undisturbed aquifers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the beauty comes at a price, too, Mr. Zambrano pointed out, not so much in terms of expensive real estate, but in the high levels of vigilance required to maintain the views and the purity of the water supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Croton lies to the east and west of Route 9, a busy and often congested highway. Turning west off the road, one finds a riverfront lined with railroad tracks, parks and the Half Moon Bay complex, which has 278 units and was built in two sections by different developers in the late 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the small and underutilized business district near the train station, Croton has shops in three other areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only about 550 of the village's 3,200 acres are not parkland or set aside as open space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That works out to about 40 percent of its space, on which Croton has a variety of housing: about 2,100 single-family homes, 120 two-family homes and 45 multifamily homes, said Daniel O'Connor, the village's building inspector and engineer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small Cape Cods can be found on side streets east of the highway, and large stone homes built in the early 1900s line North Old Post Road, with many newer colonials and contemporary homes set along Arrowcrest Drive and North Highland Place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest and most expensive homes are on multiacre lots on hillsides with river views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residential market is in a slump. As of Nov. 2, 37 single-family homes had sold this year, versus 64 on the same date a year ago and 75 in 2004, according to the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. Countywide, sales fell to 2,322 as of Nov. 2 from 3,050 the same time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price on a single-family home also slid, to $486,500 last month from $529,000 in late October 2008 and from $507,700 five years ago. The median for the county was $630,000 at the end of the third quarter, down from $710,000 in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been eight condominium sales so far this year in Croton, up from four the same period last year, though down from 42 in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All residential properties are generally taking longer to sell. Single-family homes in the school district lingered on the market an average of 168 days, compared with 135 a year ago and 110 five years ago. Condos averaged 198 days on the market, versus 143 last year and 151 in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the low end of the market, a two-bedroom one-bath house is listed at $279,000; at the high end, a seven-bedroom house with nine baths and two half baths on 9.1 acres is on the market for $3.95 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In between are a number of good buys. A four-bedroom two-bath Cape Cod on the market for six months at $439,000 is priced $100,000 below its very first list price in 2006, said Lynn A. Harmonay, a broker for <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another, Ms. Harmonay said, is a three-bedroom one-bath Cape, perfect for first-time buyers at $382,000, down from $425,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On weekends, Maria Elena DiBella, a project manager with a financial firm in Midtown, tosses aside her high heels for her jogging shoes and runs along the river, some days completing the nine-mile round trip between the Croton Point Park and Croton Landing Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the summer, Ms. DiBella, who lives in a three-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath duplex at Half Moon Bay condos, also joins friends on the Hudson in a motor boat. When the weather turns cold, she exercises in a local gym and checks out the offerings at malls in White Plains or Rockland County, both about 30 minutes away by car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She loves the natural beauty of living by the river but, as a single person, wishes there were more places to shop and meet friends. ''Personally,'' she said, ''I'd like to see a little more activity in town.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for James and Susan Sanders and their two young children the village is ideal. Mr. and Mrs. Sanders -- he is a financial analyst and she is saleswoman for a pharmaceutical company -- often ride bikes along the river with their children, walk across the Croton Dam or, when it snows, sled on a capped landfill at Croton Point Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They've lived in Croton for five years, the last year in a three-bedroom colonial on nearly an acre. Mr. Sanders declined to say what they paid for the house, but comparable homes in the neighborhood cost about $750,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For seafood lovers, dining options include the Ocean House Oyster Bar and Grill in Croton and the Goldfish Oyster Bar and Restaurant in nearby Ossining. For dessert, the Blue Pig Ice Cream Factory's offers pumpkin ice cream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The village's district consists of Carrie E. Tompkins School, which runs through Grade 4; Pierre Van Cortlandt Middle School, for Grades 5 through 8; and Croton-Harmon High School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the high school level, SAT averages last spring were 576 in critical reading, 582 in math and 573 in writing, versus 502, 515 and 494 statewide. Of the 118 students who graduated in June, 86 percent attend four-year colleges, 8 percent two-year colleges, and 6 percent joined the work force or the military.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The train ride on Metro-North's Hudson line from the Croton-Harmon Station to Grand Central Terminal takes about 50 minutes on weekday mornings. A round-trip ticket during peak hours costs $21.38 online, more at the station. A monthly ticket costs $238.14 online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The village is named after Kenoten, a chief of the Kitchawancs, part of the Wappinger Confederacy of the Algonquin Nation. Records indicate that the Kitchawancs were living in the area when Dutch traders arrived in the 1600s. Senasqua, the name of a Croton park, comes from the Kitchawanc name for the marsh separating Croton Point from Croton Neck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTO: NATURAL BEAUTIES: Croton-on-Hudson sits at the confluence of the Croton and the Hudson Rivers.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, when Columbia University tried to interest Ben Cox, then a first-year M.B.A. student, in its new apartment building in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, he scoffed. It was too far from the campus in Manhattan, he thought, and the unit was a bit expensive. He did not even bother to look at it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his family -- his wife, Sasha, and their young boy -- moved instead into an apartment in Manhattan. But at 500 square feet, it felt tiny, especially compared with the house they had owned back in Minnesota. When their second son arrived in April, the Riverdale building, called the Arbor, suddenly seemed more appealing. ''We called and wrote letters and e-mailed for a month to get in here,'' Mrs. Cox said. ''Everyone who has a kid wants to be here because it's the largest apartment you can get.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Columbia, which provides housing for more than half of its 13,000 graduate students, owns dozens of apartment buildings, many with prewar charm and within walking distance of the university's campus in Morningside Heights. Now it also offers students an apartment in the Arbor, a sleek building in Riverdale that was privately developed as a condominium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university snapped up the Arbor, a nine-story building at 235th Street and the Henry Hudson Parkway, in July 2008 for $67 million after the developer struggled to sell the condominiums. (Prices started at $400,000.) Robert Hornsby, a spokesman for Columbia, said the decision to buy the Arbor, which has 127 apartments, was part of a strategy of ''opportunistic purchases.'' It was chosen, he said, because it ''offers apartment layouts that are conducive to families.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other colleges have taken advantage of the real estate slump to push expansion plans. The City University of New York recently decided to move its law school from a cramped former junior high school in Flushing, Queens, to an underused <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> office building center in Long Island City, also in Queens. CUNY will pay <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> $155 million for six floors in the two-year-old building, far less than the cost of new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Providence, R.I., Johnson &amp; Wales University signed a lease this year on a four-story condominium building with river views and granite-and-stainless-steel kitchens. The three-year lease, with an option to renew, allowed the university to house 300 additional students this fall, when the demand for housing was ''significantly higher'' than usual, said Lisa Pelosi, a spokeswoman. The developer had tried to market the building, opposite the train station, as the economy went into free fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Columbia's purchase of the Arbor also reflects the increasing diversity of graduate students, who are often in midcareer, married with children or both. The Coxes, who moved into a two-bedroom apartment in September, are still adjusting to the luxurious touches not found in most university-owned housing: oversize picture windows, individual washers and dryers, stainless-steel appliances, marble bathrooms, a 24-hour concierge, a fitness center, even a colorful playroom with a slide and toys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is pretty extraordinary,'' Mr. Cox, 29, said as he waited out front for a shuttle van that would take him to campus. ''I've never had a kitchen this nice before. It has a full convection oven.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university owns housing in one other location outside Manhattan: a dozen apartments in Palisades, N.Y., that are reserved for postdoctoral fellows at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Rockland County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the Arbor's residents are graduate students, many of them from other countries, but some faculty members and administrators live there, too. Ross A. Frommer, associate dean for government and community affairs at Columbia University Medical Center, had signed a contract to buy a two-bedroom unit on the seventh floor of the Arbor before the developer decided to sell the building to Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife, Connie Dong, were able to rent the same apartment they had planned to buy. ''We love our apartment,'' he said. ''We certainly feel we're getting good value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some residents say there are drawbacks to living a borough away from campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the shuttle operates frequently throughout the day, the small vans are sometimes so crowded that residents are forced to wait until there is room. On weekends, there is no shuttle. Residents without cars must walk to the No. 1 subway stop -- a good 20-minute trek -- or take a bus and transfer if they need to get to campus. The walk to the station is downhill, but coming home can be a workout, especially with a stroller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You definitely trade the convenience of being right next to Columbia for more space,'' said Steve Little, 34, who is pursuing a master's degree in public administration. His two-bedroom apartment has two roomy bathrooms with marble counters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the Coxes, Mr. Little, who is from England, said the university simply assigned his family to the Arbor, whose brick-and-tinted-glass facade stands in contrast with some of the neighborhood's older buildings. ''We could have said no if we didn't fancy being here, but it suited us,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexandra and Alex Petrasincu, who have an 8-month-old daughter, were also drawn to the suburban feel of the neighborhood, where a <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> coexists with a shoe-repair shop and a traditional kosher delicatessen. The couple is from Germany, and Mr. Petrasincu, a lawyer, is enrolled in a one-year international law program. They pay Columbia $2,200 a month for their two-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With a child, there's no question that I prefer this,'' said Ms. Petrasincu, pausing in a small plaza at the back of the building, which was planted with ornamental grasses and hostas and was free of the din from the Henry Hudson Parkway. ''You have loads of children and playgrounds, and everything is within walking distance. And it seems very reasonable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Wachsman, a real estate broker who owns the Riverdale Homes agency, says that $2,200 for a two-bedroom in that building is, in today's market, ''probably bordering on the higher side, but it's in line.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hornsby declined to comment on the rents at the Arbor, but he said that Columbia's focus was not to make money. ''Unlike other entities, we're not a commercial landlord, so our goal is to provide housing,'' he said. ''We don't have a profit motive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are occasional droll reminders of the market originally envisioned for the building, which sits a few blocks from Riverdale's business district, in a neighborhood with a distinctly Jewish culture. The appliances, for example. ''The oven has a kosher function,'' Mr. Little said as his 1-year-old daughter ambled around the living room and his 3-month-old son slept in a stroller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They also said the dishwasher has a Sabbath setting,'' chimed in his wife, Deborah Muylle, ''but I don't know what that means.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress threw good money after bad this week when it voted to extend and expand a wasteful home buyer's tax credit set to expire at the end of the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new program, which will continue through the spring, is being portrayed as a rescue plan for the ailing housing market. But this costly giveaway to the real estate and mortgage industry will spend far more in taxpayers' dollars than it can ever deliver in economic benefit. As happened with the cash-for-clunkers program in the automobile industry, the program will make housing look momentarily better but is unlikely to contribute to long-term recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original program allowed a credit of $8,000 for first-time home buyers who earn up to $75,000 individually or $150,000 filing jointly. The program got a black eye earlier this month when the Treasury Department's inspector general for tax administration reported that tens of thousands of people had exploited loopholes in the law to claim credits for which they appeared not to be eligible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even before that, housing analysts were finding that the tax credit did little for home sales. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of the people who have bought homes using the credit would have purchased those homes without it. To put it another way, the tax credit has been wasteful spending, not stimulus spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill that passed both houses of Congress this week extends the program through April 2010 and grants the full tax credit to couples who earn up to $225,000. The expanded program introduces a $6,500 tax credit for people who already own homes but want to buy new ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vote gives campaigning lawmakers something to crow about on the stump. But the new tax credit appeals primarily to affluent voters who do not need the government's help buying property. And encouraging buyers to leave one house for another does nothing to reduce the glut of homes on the market, which is an important factor driving down housing prices. Finally, the tax credit does nothing about the central housing problem, which is foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Congress wants to spend the taxpayers' money to do something about the struggling housing market -- and it should -- it should invest the money where it is most needed, in better programs that help people avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Matthew White, a landscape architect, decided two years ago to sell his 1,300-square-foot apartment in Philadelphia, he knew real estate prices were plummeting. Nevertheless, he thought he could get $760,000, about what he had paid two years earlier, because he had made many improvements to the space, an airy penthouse with two verdant terraces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an incredible property, with spectacular views,'' he said. Within a month, he got what he considered an ''insulting'' bid of $525,000. Five price reductions later, he wishes he had taken that offer. ''I wasn't realistic about what I could get,'' said Mr. White, whose apartment is currently listed for $449,900. ''It is such a special place, but now I realize that doesn't matter during a recession.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in the best of times, it's hard for individuals to objectively value their homes, which often reflect their sense of self and personal style. Making things even more difficult has been general market inactivity lately, if not paralysis, which has provided little in the way of pricing guidance. But by using online resources, investigating neighborhood trends, consulting real estate experts and perhaps even asking the opinions of brutally honest friends, homeowners can arrive at a reasonably accurate appraisal even in these uncertain times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good place to start is your local tax assessor's or county clerk's office, many of which post real estate transactions on their Web sites. Links can be found at onlinedetective.com (parts under construction) and netronline.com. Those records will tell you what has recently sold in your neighborhood and for how much. Look for comparable homes with similar features and square footage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be aware that prices may not always totally reflect reality. ''The house could have been sold to a sister or been part of a larger transaction,'' said Dean Gatzlaff, a professor of real estate investment and urban economics at Florida State University in Tallahassee, like maybe a 1970s Eldorado convertible was thrown into the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People living in ''nondisclosure'' states (Alaska, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming), where the sale prices of homes in most jurisdictions are not public information, have to approximate by looking up mortgages on transferred deeds of trust and factoring in typical down payments and interest rates. In any event, don't trust tax appraisals, as they are notoriously inaccurate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look for sales within the last two to three months if there are any,'' said David Kupfer, a real estate agent with Keller Williams in Phoenix, where prices in some neighborhoods have fallen as much as 50 percent in the last two years. ''Six months ago is obsolete,'' he said, because markets have been changing so rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, real estate agents and appraisers from Manhattan to Menlo Park said they now consider sales figures older than six weeks unreliable. Other sources of information are free online home value estimators on sites like zillow.com, trulia.com and forsalebyowner.com. But these derive some of their information from public records, including tax appraisals, and are thus subject to error. A test of those sites using various residences nationwide provided valuations that ranged from exactly right to incredibly inflated. Most estimates, however, were within the rough range of reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compare the estimates with prices of homes on the market now. ''These are your direct competition even if the homes are foreclosures'' or fire sales by distressed home builders, said Jim Amorin, a real estate appraiser in Austin, Tex., and president of the Appraisal Institute, a trade organization. ''That's hard for a lot of people to accept,'' he said, when their homes weren't abandoned, repossessed or otherwise forsaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leonard Calandriello, a retired banker in Chandler, Ariz., said he felt ''entitled'' to $500,000 for the 1,975-square-foot town house he bought new in 2007 for $470,000, then upgraded with enhancements like plantation shutters and a travertine patio, spending another $30,000. But with nearby foreclosures and the developer of his community cutting deals, he has had to reduce his asking price twice since May, to $399,000. ''We may have to come down more,'' he said. ''Psychologically it can really get you down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate experts recommend that homeowners do as Mr. Calandriello did and attend nearby open houses to see how their homes compare in size and amenities. But be realistic about what truly adds value and perhaps consult the Marshall &amp; Swift Residential Cost Handbook, which professional appraisers use to assess how much, say, a fireplace or three-car garage is worth. The $300 tome is available in some business school libraries, but you can also pay $10 to use the SwiftEstimator at swiftestimator.com, which lets you do an item-by-item calculation of the value of your home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attractiveness of construction and design elements is subjective, so experts said it might be as meaningful to poll your most straight-talking friends. ''You may love your new sauna and think it's a wonderful and attractive feature, but someone else may not care, or even think they need a deduction so they can rip it out,'' Mr. Amorin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a lesson that Michel Shanks, a financial adviser, learned over the last year as she and her husband, Rick, a lawyer, tried to sell their 4,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Bellaire, Tex., a suburb of Houston. Against the advice of their real estate broker, they listed their home for $825,000, more than the prices of nearby homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're emotionally attached, so you think your home is worth more,'' she said. ''I had a landscape service and a Sub-Zero refrigerator and an icemaker on every floor, but buyers don't care, they want deals.'' The house eventually sold last February for $605,000 after 10 months and four price reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, real estate experts said the only things that command premiums these days are location, light and space. ''These are immutable, everything else can change,'' said Carey Adina Karmel of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> in New York. Even so, she said, these attributes are not worth what they once were: ''Sellers have had to lower their expectations, and it's painful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking pricing advice from real estate agents or paying $250 to $500 for a professional appraisal are options. But know their respective biases. ''The Realtor has the incentive to start high to get a bigger commission, so if you are not in a rush to sell and can accept having to lower your price later, then go with the Realtor's price,'' said Karl Case, a professor of economics at Wellesley College and a founder of the Case-Shiller home price index. ''Appraisers are worried about getting sued for inflating prices, as we saw leading up to the mortgage meltdown, so their natural bias now is to quote low. So if you want to be realistic, go with their estimate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the value of a home is the price the buyer is willing to pay. It's chance, circumstance and psychology as much as location, square footage and design that ultimately determine the price someone will pay for your house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Your home is where you live,'' said Kathy Wetmore, a Houston real estate agent, not an investment with a guaranteed return. Recalling several boom and bust cycles in her 22-year career, she added, ''You make money in business, not in real estate.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Senate and House are poised to agree on a compromise measure to extend unemployment benefits that also would expand a popular $8,000 tax credit for homebuyers, despite a recent government report on extensive mistakes and suspected fraud in the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate might pass its version as early as Wednesday, and aides to Congressional leaders say the House could accept it this week, sending the bill to President Obama to sign into law. After weeks of partisan delay in the Senate, Democrats are eager to show progress before Friday, when the October jobless report is again expected to show high unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homebuyers' credit -- enacted last year, expanded this year and scheduled to expire Nov. 30 -- would be extended to cover homes under contract by April 30. Also, it no longer would be limited to first-time buyers; people who have owned a home for at least five years could get a $6,500 credit on a new residence. Income limits for eligibility would be raised, making many more people qualify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extending and expanding the credit would cost an estimated $11 billion, on top of the $10 billion spent so far. It would be a big victory for the housing and real estate lobby and for the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, who faces a tough re-election race next year in the state with the most claims for the credit per capita.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics complain that most of the credits go to taxpayers who would have bought their homes anyway, which even the industry acknowledges. Also, a Congressional subcommittee released a Treasury Department report last month about suspected criminal and civil abuses of the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government officials testified, however, that many of the problems may be due to confusion among taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service about the overlapping 2008 and 2009 versions of the tax credit. With Congress likely to change the eligibility provision again, the new measure could present further administrative problems for the I.R.S., although the measure does include several new safeguards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not unreasonable to think that this is going to provide some further challenges for them, both in terms of implementing a third version of it and in terms of ensuring taxpayers' compliance,'' said James R. White, director of tax issues for the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury Department report said that as of Sept. 30, the I.R.S. had identified 167 suspected criminal schemes and was examining nearly 107,000 cases of potential civil violations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first person to be convicted of defrauding the tax credit program was a tax preparer in Jacksonville, Fla., who was sentenced last month to 30 months in prison. According to the Justice Department, he claimed the credit for ineligible clients, many of whom were unsuspecting, and electronically paid himself $1,000 of the credit's value each time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investigators found that more than 500 claimants of the tax credit nationwide were minors as young as 4, so the new measure will require applicants to be at least 18. Homes cannot be acquired from relatives, and taxpayers must submit a settlement statement as proof of purchase, though officials acknowledge that could be a problem for those who file tax returns electronically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While real estate groups and some economists say the credit has helped stabilize the housing market, critics say it is too costly a subsidy when low interest rates and home prices are incentives enough for most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 1.4 million claimants of the credit, fewer than a third -- about 350,000 to 400,000 -- are believed to have bought their homes because of the credit, according to independent and industry-affiliated economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the new legislation, individuals with income up to $125,000 a year and couples earning up to $225,000 would be eligible. The current income limits are $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for couples. Under both the House and Senate versions, smaller amounts are available to people of slightly higher incomes until the credit phases out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expanded homebuyers' tax credit was attached to a bill intended to extend unemployment compensation for up to 20 weeks for people who have been out of work for long periods. Another amendment would sweeten a tax break for businesses with net operating losses in 2008 and 2009.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">From Abandoned Brewery to Piazza, Philly-Style</span>
</div><div class="author">By TERRY PRISTIN   </div><div>1369 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA -- When Bart Blatstein, a local strip-mall developer, acquired an abandoned brewery a few miles from Center City nearly a decade ago, the artists who had gravitated to the surrounding area in search of cheap housing feared he would plop an unwanted big-box shopping center into their gritty Northern Liberties neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Mr. Blatstein, the president of Tower Investments, decided to build a public square inspired by the Piazza Navona in Rome, and then the residents worried that he would create a kitschy theme park, said Larry Freedman, the zoning chairman for the Northern Liberties Neighborhood Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Blatstein wound up scrapping a colonial and then an Italian-style design in favor of something entirely different.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His Piazza at Schmidts, which opened in May at Second Street near Girard Avenue, consists of an 80,000-square-foot gathering place flanked by modern industrial-looking rental apartment buildings with 414 units and three dozen small ground-floor retail spaces. At the southern end, an 80-year-old rehabilitated warehouse, now an office building, serves as a backdrop for live performances. Attached to it is a 40-foot LED screen that draws fans during Phillies' games and other televised sports events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the opposite end, an egg-shaped new office building links the plaza to Liberties Walk, four blocks of three-story apartments buildings, also with retail spaces at their base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inga Saffron, the architecture critic for The Philadelphia Inquirer, said that Mr. Blatstein had managed to do something that had eluded most developers: create a public space that feels authentic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The architecture captures the spirit of the neighborhood -- not by literally imitating the style of the surrounding buildings, but by using materials and forms that reflect the neighborhood's tough, enduring, unsentimental, working-class heritage,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The piazza, which was designed by Erdy McHenry Architecture, a local firm, has also won praise from real estate specialists and community leaders as a focal point for the neighborhood. ''It's been a surprising success on multiple levels,'' Mr. Freedman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since he bought the decrepit brewery at a foreclosure auction in 2000 for $1.8 million -- without, he said, ever walking on the site -- Mr. Blatstein has accumulated a staggering amount of real estate in Northern Liberties, which is near the Delaware River and is bounded by Callowhill Street to the south and Girard Avenue to the north.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Altogether, he owns more than 100 parcels on 28 acres and has developed more than one million square feet, including 600 residential units, with an average monthly rent of $2 a square foot. He said he had spent $150 million and planned to invest an additional $300 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blatstein said he expected to complete a two-level shopping center adjacent to the piazza next year, which will bring the neighborhood a badly needed supermarket and other retail services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A boyish 55, Mr. Blatstein was raised in northeast Philadelphia but now lives on the Main Line, in suburban Gladwyne. He made his fortune by building and selling shopping centers and by selling waterfront land that had been approved for a gambling casino. Unlike most large-scale developers, he has no partners or investors. ''I knew that along the way I was going to make a lot of modifications on the fly and would drive my partners crazy,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen P. Mullin, a senior vice president at the Econsult Corporation, a local consulting company, and a former city commerce director, said that working alone freed Mr. Blatstein from meeting other people's benchmarks and allowed him to take the sort of risks that other developers avoid. ''He is happy to get some part of his return in a nonpecuniary way,'' Mr. Mullin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he is widely admired as a risk taker, Mr. Blatstein is also viewed as someone who can be difficult. ''He whines a lot,'' said Alan Greenberger, the executive director of the City Planning Commission. ''He makes people mad sometimes, both at the city level as well as in the neighborhoods. I'm willing to put up with all that because I see the end results, and I see that they're good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Mr. Blatstein bought the brewery, housing values in Northern Liberties have increased from $32 a square foot to $140 a square foot, according to Econsult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blatstein was not the first to recognize the potential of Northern Liberties, which went into decline after it was cut off from Center City in the 1960s by Interstate 95. In the 1980s, as artists moved in, developers began rehabilitating houses where factory workers once lived. But the real estate collapse at the end of the decade halted development for 10 years, Mr. Mullin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Blatstein bought the Schmidt's Brewery, which had closed in 1987, he had no intention of creating a magnet for young people. The previous owner had rezoned the site for a shopping center, and Mr. Blatstein thought he would build one and then get out. ''Then the midlife crisis hit,'' he said, ''and I thought, What do I do? Do I get the bright red Ferrari? And then I decided, Let me do the creative thing here. I have the opportunity to do something really cool here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blatstein tore down abandoned buildings and gobbled up properties, sometimes using straw buyers to keep prices down. Some parcels were acquired through condemnation, but he said he has never displaced a resident or business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In building his piazza, Mr. Blatstein said he stuck to several principles. He limited the height of the surrounding buildings so that none were taller than seven stories. ''The buildings can't be too high because then they become overbearing,'' he said. The piazza itself had to be just the right width -- no more than 100 feet -- so that people would feel safe there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recesses and cutouts in the buildings allow people to enter at different points, tying the piazza to the surrounding streets, said Scott Erdy, one of the architects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blatstein initially intended to lease his ground-floor space to established retailers, but was not able to attract any to an untested area with a bad image. Instead he divided the storefronts into tiny spaces for fledgling entrepreneurs selling clothing, art, jewelry and even magicians' supplies. He says he has the flexibility to evict any retailer who fails to maintain a ''cool space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, residential tenants, who tend to be young singles, must agree in writing to put up with noise from the piazza. Yet Mr. Blatstein said the apartments overlooking the piazza were fully rented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With roots in the food business -- his father was a caterer and Mr. Blatstein operated farmers' markets in the 1980s -- he knew the kind of restaurants he wanted: an Italian wine bar, a pub, a burger bar and a 1950s diner. He bought the liquor licenses himself, hired designers and recruited the restaurant operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He created what he thought he would like,'' said Steven H. Gartner, the president of Metro Commercial Real Estate, a Philadelphia company. The diner, called Darling's, is in the egg-shaped building where Mr. Blatstein plans to have his office and has a Howard Johnson-like turquoise-and-orange decor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six weeks after the piazza opened, Mr. Blatstein got the kind of news that no developer wants. A man and a woman were killed in what appeared to be a drug-related attack outside the woman's apartment at the piazza. ''I wanted to go under the covers and cry,'' Mr. Blatstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the killings were viewed as something that could have happened anywhere and merely made people curious to see the piazza, Mr. Blatstein said. ''I couldn't get front-page coverage when I opened,'' he said. ''This is what did it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brookville -- GAWKING at lofty turrets, castle-sized rooms, smart technology and 10 full and 4 half baths, a cluster of real estate agents toured a 17-room stone and stucco mansion during an open house here on a recent afternoon. Meanwhile, craftsmen on scaffolding continued to work on the foyer's domed ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leading the tour was Shawn Elliott, owner of the Woodbury-based Shawn Elliott Luxury Homes and Estates, who had a lot to point out to his audience: the 45 heavy custom-made mahogany doors; the four-car heated garage; the lower level, where a movie theater, wine cellar, game room and housekeepers' quarters were being built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buy this custom home now, Mr. Elliott said, and it could be had for the bargain-basement price of $9 million. Wait until it's finished in January and the tab will be $12.95 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When it is done, it will be off the charts,'' he added, spinning the tale of the owner, who invested three years and $11 million, only to change his mind because of a relationship gone sour before the house was ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Describing his former client as a ''guy who says he wants the best of the best,'' Mr. Elliott promoted the home's 14 separate heating zones and fancy generator system. Landscaping on the 5.43 acres -- including a pool, a koi pond with a waterfall, a tennis court and a cabana -- was not quite complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the owner had spared no expense. ''He was looking to live here for the next 20 years,'' Mr. Elliott said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Someone who takes it as is saves a lot of money,'' he added. ''They save a lot of time, if you like his taste.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But taste can be a sticking point, especially at stratospheric prices. The house is one of several nearly finished ultra-high-end ''dream homes'' on Long Island, built to the personal specification of owners who changed their minds near the end of the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a selection of high-end speculative houses partly built, but awaiting the personal tastes of buyers who, in this market, may or may not materialize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are people who would just love to buy a house that's done,'' said Kevin Omland of the Syosset-based Omland Building and Midnight Sun Design. ''A custom-built house involves a lot of decisions at every stage, and for a lot of people that is overwhelming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a cul-de-sac in Muttontown, two of the three homes that Mr. Omland designed to clients' individual tastes will sooner or later end up in different hands than originally expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One client bailed out for financial reasons. ''They would be stretching their funds to be able to live comfortably by the time they paid their taxes,'' Mr. Omland said. That colonial was sold to another couple, who repainted and wallpapered some rooms and added a pool and cabana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Omland wasn't as lucky with a 6,800-square-foot Hamptons-style shingle house on four acres, with all the bells and whistles of custom construction. Work was well under way when the client informed the builder that he ''had another investment opportunity,'' and stuck the property on the market for $4.399 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When somebody wants out, it takes the wind out of your sails,'' Mr. Omland said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara Tomko, the Shawn Elliott agent who has that listing, says that it is now priced at $3,899,999 and that its configuration might be too idiosyncratic to appeal to many buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The floor plan for that house was made for the original buyer and his needs,'' Ms. Tomko said. ''It's a less formal layout, and the look is more country Southampton.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New owners can still add their own imprint and pick the paint colors. In the $130,000 kitchen, six-inch oak planking has been installed on the floor, but the cabinet doors and drawers, the spice rack and the corbels can still be fabricated to order, Mr. Omland said. ''It is all custom -- hand-holding all the way,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bathrooms need to be tiled and plumbing fixtures chosen, with an allowance based on the initial job specifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The original buyer didn't get that far,'' Mr. Omland said. ''We would rather be a little frustrated and wait for the right person to finish the house. For us it's not a house, it's a home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The designer is showing prospective buyers what can be altered and what would be more difficult to change at this juncture. But without a viable offer soon, he will complete it his way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ilan Yerushalmi, a principal with the Williston Park-based Napoleon Development, forged ahead during a slipping market with a luxury spec house in Old Westbury: a 9,000-square-foot eight-bedroom $8.299 million brick colonial with twin turrets, Jerusalem stone floors, six fireplaces, an elevator and a slate roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though seriously interested, a recent shopper wasn't sure about the color of the floors and had a hard time visualizing what the kitchen would look like when finished. But he signed a contract after the builder agreed to move the tennis court to a different spot on the five-acre property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even when times are hard,'' Mr. Yerushalmi said, ''there are people who still want quality.'' He is racing to complete the house and close on it by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wendy Osinoff Sutton, a broker with Daniel Gale, recently listed another semifinished custom house in Old Westbury: a $10 million ultramodern 18,000-square-foot home with an art gallery, a movie theater, a library and a guest suite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project has been ''dragging on'' for three years, Ms. Sutton said. The owner, whom she declined to identify, ''bought a business in another state'' and is moving. ''They are heartbroken that they are giving it up,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the poured-concrete house about 80 percent complete, Ms. Sutton is hoping to find a buyer before final design decisions are made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owner, she said, ''doesn't want to do the finishings, like the Venetian plaster, and pick a color and have someone come in and say, 'I love Venetian plaster, but I hate the color.' ''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HENRY ELGHANAYAN marched into a conference room high above Third Avenue in Midtown Manhattan on March 4. After nearly four decades as partners, he and two of his brothers were dividing up their $3 billion real estate empire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if it were some neighborhood bet, the flip of a coin would determine how to split their 8,000 apartments and nine development sites in New York and nine office buildings in New York and Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henry's brothers K. Thomas and Frederick Elghanayan, who remain partners, sent lawyers to represent them. They were still grieving over the death of their mother, Victoria, the day before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a table in the conference room, Michael P. Korotkin, the three brothers' longtime real estate lawyer, placed two opaque envelopes. Whoever picked the envelope containing a plastic coffee stirrer would be the one to call heads or tails. If he called the toss correctly, he would get first pick of three groups of assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henry chose the envelope with the coffee stirrer. As Mr. Korotkin flipped a quarter into the air, Henry paused, and at the last moment called tails. Tails it was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was exciting,'' said Henry, 69. ''It made a big difference whether you picked first or second.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with property breakups of some other New York real estate families -- often long, messy affairs replete with blood feuds, lawsuits and ugly recriminations -- the Elghanayan brothers' split has been relatively swift, smooth and secretive. The Milstein family fought for a decade over control of a $5 billion fortune that included hotels, apartment buildings and a bank. The wrestling match over the billion-dollar estate of the land speculator Sol Goldman lasted seven years. And who can forget the squabbling over Harry B. Helmsley's $8 billion empire, part of which eventually went to his wife's poodle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Elghanayan brothers didn't slap one another with lawsuits. And there were no vicious industry rumors, or anonymous mudslinging in the gossip columns, about the fate of this very private family that ran the <span class="companylink">Rockrose Development Corporation</span>, one of the city's largest developers of residential buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of the families have had very unpleasant break-ups,'' said Daniel Brodsky, a developer and a close friend of Tom Elghanayan. ''They managed to do it in a very civilized way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Civilized, yes. But that doesn't mean it's been free of tension. For one thing, Henry's decision to initiate it, as well as the assets he selected, surprised his brothers. There would be much horse trading before the breakup was legally completed on Sept. 29, and the brothers acknowledge some bumps along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, both Fred and Tom expressed resignation and a little bewilderment. They now operate in the family's longtime offices on Park Avenue South as TF Cornerstone, while Henry runs a separate business under the Rockrose name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're still scratching our heads about why it all happened,'' said Tom, 64.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tensions were evident last week as the three gathered for a photograph for this article. When Henry, as the eldest brother, insisted on his traditional spot in the middle, Fred and Tom simultaneously responded, ''No way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE Elghanayans' father, Nourallah, was a prominent manufacturer in Iran under the shah. He moved his family to Queens in the 1950s, when Houchang, who is known as Henry, and Tom were children. Their father and mother continued to shuttle between Iran and Queens, where the family settled on Rockrose Place, a two-block-long street in Forest Hills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their father dabbled in real estate, but Tom suggested that their formative moments came during ''vicious, daylong Monopoly'' games. ''Monopoly teaches you many long-term lessons: to buy property and build quickly,'' he said. ''You can get wiped out by the randomness of the dice, or the vagaries of the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brothers very nearly crashed and burned with their first project in 1970, when they began renovating small buildings in and around Greenwich Village. Their father had given Henry and Tom $100,000 to start the business. They put everything they had into renovating a walkup at 31 West 16th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as they finished, the real estate market crashed. They were able to sell only one of the six apartments. Henry and Tom, as well as Fred, who would join them in the business, each moved into a unit, while the ground-floor apartment became an office. ''We were very lucky to sell that one unit,'' Henry said. ''We needed the money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the market came back, they refinanced and began buying other buildings, on the Upper West Side and in Brooklyn Heights. Each deal brought a larger renovation project, and then construction of new buildings. In 1977, they converted an industrial building on East 46th Street into Turtle Bay Towers, with 337 rental apartments. A decade later, they turned a landmark warehouse into the Archive, with 479 rental apartments at 666 Greenwich Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Elghanayans extended their reputation for doing projects in what real estate brokers call ''emerging neighborhoods'' when, in the 1990s, they started converting office buildings into rental apartments in the financial district. They were also pioneers on the Queens waterfront in Long Island City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now they are also building on the Far West Side in Manhattan, a once-industrial area that was rezoned for high-rise construction in 2005. After the attack on the World Trade Center, the Elghanayans also sought to diversify, buying a half-dozen office buildings in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Elghanayans, like many of New York's old real estate families, took a conservative approach to financing. They often bought land for cash and kept leverage low. ''We never had mezzanine loans,'' Tom said. ''We financed 75 percent of value, not 95 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over time, the brothers developed a clear division of labor: Fred, an engineer, handled construction. Tom, a graduate of Yale and Harvard Business School, did development and acquisitions. Henry, a lawyer, handled financing and, later, commercial buildings. Their youngest brother, Jeffrey, who left the partnership in 1989, is an architect. Every Wednesday, they met over lunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The differing responsibilities were matched by different personalities. Tom, the most outgoing, is a sports fan who plays tennis and golf. (His former wife, Sharon, is now dating Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey.) Fred, the quietest, is an art collector, specializing in German Expressionism and Egyptian antiquities. Henry, whose neatly clipped white beard gives him a professorial air, also collects art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's part of the secret of our success,'' Henry said. ''We didn't step on each other's toes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE split came, as splits often do, over the issue of succession. Henry wanted a clear path for his son, Justin, 31, the only offspring of the three brothers who is active in the family business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was more interested in the question of succession because my son was in the business,'' Henry said. ''At some point, I thought it was better for the whole family that we divide.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henry also wanted to be a developer in his own right. Buying existing office buildings does not get the same attention in New York as building towers, suggested one longtime executive at Rockrose. Henry also wanted to take on partners by creating an investment fund, something his brothers opposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's a question of who wanted to be a big developer versus who wanted to be an operator,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After months of discussion about revising the partnership, Henry sent his brothers a legal notice in August 2008 that he was seeking to dissolve it. The notice was required under a detailed partnership agreement they drew up in 1989 after Jeffrey left the business for California. Back then, they had had to resort to binding arbitration, with their father as an arbiter. Afterward, all three brothers decided they needed a more formal procedure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the coin toss, the document provided for a ''pile maker'' to carve the assets into three groups, and a reverse auction where the lowest bidder would win the right to decides which properties go into each pile. ''This procedure was cooked up by all three of us,'' Tom said. ''It was not a lawyer's construct. In many ways it was like a chess game.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Elghanayans recently discovered that their method shares traits with game theory, a once-obscure academic area that has been adopted by corporate titans and Pentagon generals in seeking mathematical solutions to real-life issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, Henry heard Ingrid C. Daubechies, a mathematician at Princeton, give a presentation about a game-theory challenge. In the challenge, players had to divide property fairly in a situation where they value assets differently -- one may have a stronger sentimental attachment to a family's vacation cabin than the other siblings, for example, while another covets the yacht. After the presentation, Henry asked Ms. Daubechies about his own family's solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the Elghanayans appeared to have come up with what game theorists call an ''envy free'' solution. ''Paradoxically,'' she said, ''because players have different preferences, a mathematical argument makes it possible to arrive at a situation where every player feels they receive a share larger than what any of the others gets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Elghanayans' plan, the auction was the next step after Henry sent the notice. In January, they met at Mr. Korotkin's office in Midtown, where they drew straws to see who would bid first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a half-hour, it was clear that Fred was the low bidder, and winner of the auction. He had an incentive to be fair; he would get the remaining pile, after his brothers made their choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I made three piles in 60 days,'' Fred, who is 61, said. ''We had appraisals done internally.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That led to the coin flip in March to see who would pick first. The next day, their father, Nourallah, died, two days after their mother passed away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henry picked pile No. 3, which contained the ''Rockrose'' name and most of the family's development sites, as well as eight residential buildings with 2,634 apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom and Fred were dumbstruck. ''Fred and I were really the development company,'' Tom said. They got the rest: 13 apartment buildings with more than 5,000 apartments, the office buildings and properties in Long Island City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I always wanted to be a developer,'' Henry explained. ''That's what did it for me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUT there was a twist yet to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The breakup was supposed to be completed in June. It was delayed time and again as lawyers for both sides pored over documents and financials on each property. There was also a bit of horse trading going on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several executives who have worked with Rockrose suggested that most of the employees in the development division went with Fred and Tom, hobbling Henry's ability to jump quickly into development work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the deal closed in September, Henry traded back many of the development sites to his brothers, including two large buildings under way on the Far West Side and four sites at Queens West. In exchange, Henry got parcels at Court Square in Long Island City, which unlike Queens West are not on a development timetable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henry said that although he was both ''sad and nostalgic'' on the day he officially left, he looked forward to ''starting a new enterprise with different people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may not be the best time to be heavily invested in real estate, but both sides say they can weather the economic storm, much as they have in the past, because they are not burdened by heavy debts. All three brothers say there is a great opportunity to buy distressed assets from other developers and their lenders ''at below replacement cost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're doing business the old-fashioned way,'' Tom says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ASK many Connecticut residents to describe ''the Valley'' -- the string of communities along the Naugatuck River -- and the answer is bound to include mentions of boarded-up factories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They would have a point. By the late 20th century, many of the brass, wire and rubber mills that once rumbled by the river's frothy waters lost work to other regions, and were shuttered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one look at the Valley enclave of Oxford, 87 miles from Manhattan in New Haven County, suggests a different history. Its leafy slopes, crossed with stone walls and roads that seem no wider than deer paths, bear few traces of industrialization. In fact, in the mid-1800s, there was a devastating population drain in Oxford, according to accounts, as farmers laid down their pitchforks and decamped for those mills and their sizable paychecks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was then. Modern Oxford is undergoing a significant growth spurt. From 2000 to 2008, there was a 30 percent surge, to 12,734 residents from 9,821, according to the Council of Governments of the Central Naugatuck Valley. The state as a whole grew just 3 percent during that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep Oxford Green, a political action committee, sees new residents as helping to build the town's tax base. But its members are troubled by proposals to add high-density condos, apartments and trailer parks, which tend to be more affordable by nature. Ed Carver, a co-founder of the group, said the town would be better served by lower-density development, as homes with more square feet generate more property tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, he asserted, residents in high-density housing usually consume more resources than they generate, and could create a new drag on the school system. The issue won't be on the ballot this Election Day, but Mr. Carver said he and the 300 who signed his petitions hoped to force a referendum this winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's plenty of affordable housing close by in other towns,'' said Mr. Carver, a 22-year resident and business owner who is building a 3,000-square-foot home on 8.5 acres. ''It's not as if you have to drive 30 miles away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Carver's opinion isn't unanimously shared. Town officials worry that without enough high-density housing, Oxford would have trouble retaining young people. And statistics show that people who live in smaller homes have fewer children, they contend, so school use shouldn't be a concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, Oxford could land in trouble without more low-income housing; it has only Crestview Ridge, a 45-unit retiree complex representing 1 percent of the housing stock. The state requires that amount to be 10 percent, under a 1989 law that essentially encourages zoning boards to open their doors to builders of affordable housing. If they don't, developers can sue and win, which might result in pell-mell construction, says Herman Schuler, Oxford's economic development director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We would rather plan this,'' said Mr. Schuler, who retired to Oxford from Orange, Conn., five years ago. ''We don't want it happening randomly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the debate over random versus planned can seem academic when you take in Oxford's autumn beauty. The view from the window of Inge van Ark's four-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath colonial, perched at high altitude, offers gold-flecked ridges and ponds twinkling in the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. van Ark moved to Oxford from the Netherlands this year after her husband, Bart, an economist, took a job in Manhattan. The move has allowed her to indulge a quilting habit she picked up during a previous visit to the States. A local store even offers classes, in addition to threads and fabrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of her creations, still works in progress, are to hang in the upstairs hall of her house, which she and her husband bought for $655,000 in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ridgefield, where she also looked, that price would have bought far less house, and in Katonah, in Westchester County, she said, any bargains would have been offset by hefty property tax bills. ''Money goes a lot further here,'' she said. ''But with the woods and lake and turning leaves, it's gorgeous living.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New residents of Oxford, which covers 33 square miles, are concentrated in a few communities catering to people 55 and older. The most significant is the 630-acre Village at Oxford Greens, built by <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span> five years ago around an 18-hole public golf course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of its 330 sharply gabled homes, 300 have sold; prices range from $389,900 to $460,000, said Tad Serrao, the sales manager. A new phase, with 105 condos, is to begin construction in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oxford Greens went up on the site of a former horse farm, but agriculture is thriving elsewhere in Oxford. In 2007 the town had 47 working farms, which ranked its ZIP code 27th among 269 in the state, according to the federal Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schreiber's Farm, its pastures punctuated with cows and red barns, unfolds along the Eight Mile Brook in the historic Quaker Farms section. It neighbors a group of well-tended Greek Revivals, among the few examples of 19th-century architecture in Oxford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town is largely made up of postwar ranches and colonials, like the kind along Thorson Road, in the wooded area near Southbury, or along Chestnut Tree Hill Road, which flanks a verdant ridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governors Hill and Academy Roads are home to several handsome center-chimney houses that date to the 18th century. Brokers say those antiques have rarely hit the market since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have fallen 20 percent since the peak in 2006. Through the first three-quarters of 2009, 161 sales closed, for an average price of $371,092, versus 122 homes for $458,494 three years ago, according to the Connecticut Statewide Multiple Listings Service. But even as residents debate Oxford's future affordability, the town does seem competitive. The 85 homes on the market in mid-October had an average price of $507,000, the listing service shows; nothing exceeded $850,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a far cry from Newtown, next door, where some who end up in Oxford start their hunt. The average price there in October was $650,000, with a number of homes exceeding $1 million, said Johnathan Dias, a broker with Re/Max Preferred Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, in step with the housing downturn have come short sales, which made up 10 percent of the listings this year and help explain the increased sales, said Pat Blanko, a broker with William Raveis Real Estate. She cautions prospective buyers not to expect smooth sailing on such transactions, which often require much presale back-and-forth with lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're not what they're cracked up to be,'' Ms. Blanko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oxford is bisected by Route 67, whose offerings are mostly limited to plazas with banks, hair salons and chain restaurants. For a nice dinner, many head to New Haven, a 25-minute drive away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But an offbeat option can be found closer: The 121 Restaurant has a glass-fronted dining room abutting Waterbury-Oxford Airport, which has the state's longest runway after Bradley International Airport. Corporate jets roar skyward while diners enjoy dishes like organic roast chicken ($22).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mountain bikers and horse riders also pass by, on the Larkin Bridle Trail, a looping 10.4-mile path built on a former train track in the 1940s, which makes it a pioneer of the rails-to-trails movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For kindergarten through second grade, students attend the Quaker Farms School; and third through fifth are spent at the Oxford Center School. Last year, 90 percent of fourth graders met standards in math, 82 percent in reading and 95 percent in writing, versus 85, 74 and 85 statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ninety-two percent of eighth graders at Great Oak Middle School met state standards in math, 94percent in reading and 94 percent in writing. Statewide, those numbers were 85, 81 and 84 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oxford High School opened in 2007. Previously, students headed to Seymour or Monroe. As the first class won't graduate until next spring, SAT averages aren't yet available. The school, which has 570 students, offers six Advanced Placement classes and three foreign languages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One nearby train station is in Beacon Falls; the other is in Seymour. Both are on the Waterbury branch of Metro-North's New Haven line, which has two trains running to Grand Central Terminal on weekdays between 6 and 8 a.m., with a connection in either Bridgeport or Stamford. The trip takes about two hours. From Seymour the monthly fare is $355 ($347.90 online), but station parking is free, and typically plentiful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1700s, farmers herded livestock down Route 67 from Litchfield to New Haven, where ships waited, said Dorothy DeBisschop, the town historian. Weary travelers would rest at the Oxford Hotel, now known as the Oxford House, a multicolumned restaurant resembling Mount Vernon, while their animals sipped from the Little River.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIXER-UPPERS are not the darlings of the New York City real estate market right now. With so many well-groomed apartments for sale to choose from, why bother? But when there is a lot of inventory on the market, the price gap between the renovated and unrenovated often grows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you see now,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, ''is more of a premium placed on renovated space because you have more supply, more choices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some buyers look at a wrecked apartment and see an opportunity, not just a mess, no matter where the rest of the market is headed. Brokers say those buyers are digging through listings and searching for places that, in exchange for ''tender loving care'' or even ''divine intervention,'' provide an incentive to buy -- a good price, a great location, a spot in a renowned building or an extra bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is more upside potential for something raw or unrenovated now, simply because fewer people want them,'' Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A classic example of a fixer-upper is now on the market in Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment, in a 1922 Jackson Heights co-op building called the Chateau, has four bedrooms and three bathrooms and is listed for $490,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the Grey Gardens of the Chateau,'' said the broker, Michael P. Carfagna of MPC Properties. ''Shabby chic,'' he added with a smile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment has high ceilings, lots of light, a working fireplace, and nice original detail. But the floors need to be sanded and polished, the electrical wiring updated and the bathrooms and kitchen gutted. The walls, covered in a variety of elaborate wallpaper, also need work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This apartment is on the second floor of the six-story building. The same size apartment in better condition on the floor below sold in May for $645,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Carfagna, who was the listing agent on that apartment as well, the higher-priced unit was renovated with high-end finishes about 10 years ago and has been well maintained since. The people who bought that place, he says, saw the cheaper one upstairs but decided against the hassle of a big project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rick Wohlfarth, the president of the real estate brokerage Wohlfarth &amp; Associates in Manhattan, says most of his clients aren't interested in renovating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are those groups who are willing to pay a little extra to just move in and put out their toothbrush,'' Mr. Wohlfarth said. ''That is the easiest way to sell an apartment in New York City, the most expeditious way. Then you have the other group of buyers who really enjoy projects.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has a listing at 789 West End Avenue: a two-bedroom one-bathroom apartment, which will soon come on the market for $899,000. The unit, No. 12B, has views of the Hudson River and great bones, like high ceilings and solid prewar construction, but it looks as if it hadn't been touched in decades and is badly in need of renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The electrical system needs to be updated, the floors buffed, the walls repaired and the bathroom gutted. The kitchen, which also looks ''prewar,'' needs a total overhaul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To price a fixer-upper apartment like this one, Mr. Wohlfarth said, you start the way you would price any home, by looking at comparable apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report generated by Streeteasy.com, a Web site that tracks listing data, shows that the average asking price for two-bedroom apartments on the Upper West Side is $1.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, Mr. Wohlfarth said, he deducts the renovation costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those costs can vary significantly, and so can the discount that brokers factor in on apartments needing work. Buyers might break even -- spending the same amount after renovations that they would have to purchase an apartment in move-in condition -- or they might save some money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen and Christian Brooks recently closed on a one-bedroom in Gramercy that needs a new kitchen, a new bathroom and perhaps new floors as well. Even with the renovation cost, they expect to spend less money than they would have if they had bought a home that was ready to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we were going to see apartments,'' Ms. Brooks said, ''the renovated ones were going at a premium. And they were nice, but it was always the case that I wouldn't have picked that countertop, or it was a different type of style than I might go for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are waiting to hear back on bids from contractors, but they have been given some quotations on cabinets, and, Ms. Brooks says, they were lower than she had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were able to get a really nice place at a lower price,'' she said. ''And we were able to stay below jumbo numbers with the loan we got.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the National Association of Home Builders, an index that measures the cost of many materials used in home construction was down about 4.5 percent in September from a year earlier for single-family homes and some 6.1 percent for multifamily homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Melman, the director of economic services at the association, said that at the beginning of the year, contractors' phones simply were not ringing. ''That has picked up dramatically,'' he said, ''but it's still not where it was.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing, it turns out, can be the trickiest part of buying a fixer-upper these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Banks are much tougher on the condition of an apartment,'' said Melissa Cohn, the president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company. ''The banks want to see that the apartments are complete and habitable. And it's impossible to finance renovation. You have to have the cash.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though they can be tricky to orchestrate, deals on fixer-uppers are still being done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It hasn't completely stopped,'' Ms. Cohn said, ''it's just much more difficult than it's ever been. Then again, everything about the world of financing is more difficult than it's ever been.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, bank financing is simply not an option for apartments that are badly in need of renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lee-Ann Pinder, a real estate agent with Citi Habitats, has a listing in the Hamilton Heights section of Harlem that will require intense rehabbing and an all-cash deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment, a 750-square-foot two-bedroom with one bathroom, has good light and a great deal of flexibility since most of the interior walls can come down, because they are not load-bearing. The building, a co-op on 152nd Street and Convent Avenue, is income restricted at $64,500 for an individual and $73,725 for a couple --which, combined with the all-cash requirement, creates a difficult formula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To put the apartment within somebody's reach, the co-op, which owns the apartment, is asking $150,000. According to Streeteasy.com, there is only one apartment available in Hamilton Heights for less: a one-bedroom listed at $125,000 a few blocks away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Pinder's listing needs more than a little sprucing up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The kitchen looks as if someone decided to get the necessary gutting started (where's the stove?), and some of the walls in the apartment appear to have been on the business end of an ax -- an impression advanced by the presence of a small red fire hatchet on the kitchen counter on a recent Wednesday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a glorious mess,'' Ms. Pinder said. ''It needs to be gutted. But then you can do what you want with the space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some apartments, however, the configuration of space is exactly the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, for example, a 2,600-square-foot duplex available for sale in the Osborne, a grand building on 57th Street and Seventh Avenue that went up in the 1880s. And it needs work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment was cobbled together out of three smaller units -- a studio on the fifth floor and two one-bedrooms, one on the fifth floor and one on the sixth. It has three bathrooms, two small kitchens, the space for three bedrooms, and a deeply confusing layout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing agent, Deborah Gimelson of Brown Harris Stevens, says that the seller bought it in its current configuration as a pied-a-terre. She does not know who the mastermind was behind the layout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wish I knew,'' she said, ''because I'd really like to have a discussion with him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment is listed at $1.675 million, down almost $1 million from the original price of $2.6 million last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's still a lot of money for a three-bedroom apartment, but the building tends to command a premium -- the ceilings are almost 14 feet high in some rooms and there are large, elaborate fireplaces in the shared foyers outside the apartment entrances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Streeteasy.com, active listings in the building range from $435,000, for a 600-square-foot one-bedroom, to $4.49 million for a 3,200-square-foot four-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People who come here really want this building,'' Ms. Gimelson said. ''But you have to like a project -- this will be a project.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When an apartment badly in need of renovation is for sale, the broker has to be up to the job as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a laborious task to sell unrenovated apartments,'' said Jill Jordan, a broker with Halstead Property. ''People will want to bring their architects and their mothers -- and then they want to bring everybody back! It's a long process.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Jordan has a listing at 27 West 55th Street for a two-bedroom apartment with one bathroom, on the eighth floor of a co-op building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At $600,000, the apartment is reasonably priced, though not a steal. A renovated one-bedroom one-and-a-half-bath unit is listed for sale in the same building for $649,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carpeting needs to be torn up and the wood floors fixed or replaced. The walls and the ceiling need work, and the kitchen and bathroom need to be gutted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, she says, if done right, that work would be rewarded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The benefit is they get to live in a nicer apartment than they can afford,'' she said. ''They're living in a better apartment than they paid for.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. If we buy a car this year and pay state tax, do we get a deduction or does the tax actually come off the income tax we owe? Is it affected by the Alternative Minimum Tax? Can you still take the income tax deduction if you pay off the car with a loan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, how much income can one have before it is hit by the A.M.T.? This year, taking money out of one's Individual Retirement Account is voluntary. Is it better to take more out this year, because one will be hit by higher taxes in 2011? Is there a maximum amount one should take out this year (it is our only source of income aside from Social Security) before the taxes become too high?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Louise Yarvis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Whether you pay cash or finance a car is irrelevant to your income taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you itemize deductions, you can choose to deduct your state and local sales taxes or to deduct your state and any local income taxes, but not both. If you are subject to the A.M.T., you get no deduction for state and local taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether you will owe A.M.T. depends on a lot of factors. In theory, it can hit a single parent making less than $700 a week, but most of those affected make between $75,000 and $1 million, are parents who own their home and have dependent children, and live in states with high taxes (which are also generally the states with higher incomes).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. I was reading Easing Impact of a Tax Rise, and I was confused about one of your suggestions. Are you telling the reader to make his or her salary as low as a possible (through 401k contributions) because this will set the stage for your future taxes? Should I contribute more to my 401k to bring my salary down so that I will not be taxed as much in the future?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Stefan Kuczinski</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Stefan, my apologies for not being clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You will save on federal income taxes if you can take more income in 2009 and 2010 if you are in the top two tax brackets and less in 2011. If you own your own business, you may have flexibility to determine when you take income. If you are key talent, your employer may agree to, say, a big bonus in December 2010 in return for a smaller salary in 2011. Your employer would, of course, want an assurance that you will stay around, so at the end of 2011 his net cost for employing you is unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By taking income in 2009 and 2010, known as ''accelerating income,'' you will pay 35 percent if you are in the top tax bracket, instead of 39.6 percent in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After retirement: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, save now in a tax-deferred 401(k). If you are in the top tax bracket and save this year and next, you will avoid a 35 percent tax and in 2011 a 39.6 percent tax. If in old age you are down in the 15 percent bracket, you will be ahead by more than 20 percentage points or more than $200 for each $1,000 you withdraw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, if you put money in a Roth 401(k), the equation reverses. This year and next, you would save, say, $20,000 and pay a tax on top of that of $7,000, or 35 percent. In 2011, you would pay $7,920.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If in old age your income is in the 15 percent bracket (the most common marginal tax rate for all taxpayers), you will have made a bad deal. The Roth withdrawals will be free of tax, but you will have paid a lot more tax than you needed to -- and extra 20 or 24.6 percentage points. Ouch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We do not know what tax rates will be in the future. But President Obama campaigned on higher taxes for couples making more than $250,000 ($200,000 for singles) and no tax increases for those making less. He already signed a two-year tax cut affecting about 95 percent of workers. Jennifer Psaki, a White House spokeswoman, and Austan Goolsbee, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, both told me that the pledge to not raise taxes on the bottom 98 percent of Americans is ironclad with no wiggle room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. My wife and I both work for large corporations. We recently got married. We're dreading doing our taxes next year and have recently heard from some friends (but wanted to confirm) that we have to file taxes jointly the first year after marriage? Is this accurate? Is there a benefit to filing our taxes separately although we're married?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Laike Stewart</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Congratulations on your wedding and the fact that you now have two incomes to support one household. And, yes, Congress requires that for the year that you tied the knot you must file as married, either jointly or separately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Congress lets married heterosexual couples file joint tax returns, some people pay more than if they just lived together while others pay less. Under a law signed by President Clinton, Congress denies these tax benefits, and penalties, to same-sex married couples, an issue sure to be examined in the courts in the context of the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With tax software, or the help of a well-informed tax preparer, you can determine if you can arrange your deductions so that filing separately saves you money. Complicating this is the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is why couple-specific advice from a tax professional or tax software is crucial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. If a married couple has few assets (under $50,000 in retirement savings between the two), and one makes $100,000 and the other $160,000, and are about to have a baby, and buy a $750,000 house with a mortgage, both work, will the tax savings found in divorcing to avoid the Alternative Minimum Tax make up for the other costs involved? Strictly economically speaking, of course!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Anonymous</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Divorce would be a severe remedy to a tax issue, one that probably will not help your situation. And divorce affects a lot more than taxes, including pension rights, access to your partner in a hospital, the ability to make end-of-life decisions (which can come up at any time by accident), to name a few in a long list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But your question (and one that follows from another reader) goes to how Congress intrudes into marriages. While the courts have ruled that the government has no interest in how couples hold each other, Congress sets rules that affect how married couples hold their money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At your income level, and with a mortgage that big, the A.M.T. will probably cost you less than $5,000. You may be able to maximize your tax savings by filing separately, but you need a tax adviser who knows the rules and how to use tax software to figure out your particular situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. If I leave all my money to my wife and she leaves $7 million to our children, is there any estate tax on her death?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Anonymous</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. There can be a lot of estate tax due -- almost $1.6 million at the federal level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, how can that be, since each individual can leave $3.5 million free of estate tax?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer is that Congress could make it easy, but instead, it set rules that intrude deeply into the financial affairs of married couples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So you must have that $3.5 million if you die first titled in your name, and it must then go into a credit shelter trust. Otherwise, your $3.5 million exemption is lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a simple way to solve this, which I have written about in my column for the journal Tax Notes, available free here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estate tax lawyers and professors have raised minor issues about tweaking my simplification plan, but no fundamental objections have been raised. You hear a lot of rhetoric about tax simplification, but here is a proposal that can work, can make sure people get what Congress promised and will get government out of the financial arrangements within marriages. But will Congress do anything?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your wife's estate could also owe a lot of state-level estate tax. Why? Because the estate changes sponsored by President George W. Bush eliminated the ability of people to have the state-level share of any estate tax come out of the federal tax. The Bush changes actually raised the total tax for many people, the opposite of Mr. Bush's assertion that he wanted to get rid of what he called the ''death tax.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, many states have much lower thresholds for applying the state-level estate tax than the $3.5 million federal limit. (And a few states tax the recipients through an inheritance tax).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Everything I've read says that you can't deduct losses on the sale of a house. I had to sell my house in 2008 for $105,000 less than I paid for it and pay the Realtor's commission. To cover those expenses, I had to withdraw money from my I.R.A., which will be counted as income. Is there any way out of this? It seems the I.R.S. is punishing for me for doing the right thing -- i.e., not walking away from my debt by declaring bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Catherine Henry</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. That's awful, and having once sold a house at a big loss, I know how you feel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the I.R.S. is not doing anything to you, Congress is. Congress makes the tax laws; the I.R.S. is just the federal tax police department, which administers and enforces the laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The theory on not letting you deduct losses on a house is that you got those mortgage interest and property tax deductions, so it is unfair to give you an extra dollop of tax breaks. But calculations I have done from the I.R.S. Statistics of Income data tables reveal that a majority of homeowners do not qualify to deduct their mortgage interest and property taxes. Worse, some of those who do qualify have the property tax deduction taken away by the A.M.T.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am always astounded when I talk to people who say they bought a house for the tax breaks, but then tell me they file a short-form tax return. If you do not itemize, and do not have enough deductions to make itemizing worthwhile, you do not get Uncle Sam to share in your mortgage interest and property tax costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were some ways out of your mess. Had you converted your home to a rental and rented it out before selling you could take the loss, provided the I.R.S. accepted your purchase price and related costs, known as basis, as legitimate for the value of the home at the time of the conversion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while you think it would have been wrong to walk away from the mortgage, lenders are supposed to price that risk into mortgages and into their decision on whether a property's value supports the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That the law allows people walk away in your situation, that the market sells private mortgage insurance for such situations (and lenders often require that you buy it) and that some states have rules limiting the lender's recovery to only the value of the home it issued a mortgage on all suggest that that a cold-blooded business decision to walk away is legal and reasonable. Of course, if you had walked away from the debt, the market would extract a price from you. For 7 to 10 years, you may have been denied credit or charged higher interest rates. But that price might be a lot of less than a loss of more than $100,000 that was not tax deductible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. We started leasing an all-electric Mini Cooper vehicle ($850 a month) in June and would like to know what tax deductions, if any, (both federal and New York State) we may be eligible to claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- John Kominos</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Your vehicle is not on the government's list of automobiles that qualify for the federal tax credit. Nathalie Bauters of <span class="companylink">BMW</span>'s Mini USA division said that because a limited number of the electric cars are on short-term leases and because the vehicle is not generally available for sale now, it does not qualify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you use your car for business, however, treat it like any other leased automobile on your tax return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Regarding the Where the Tax Breaks Went graphic that accompanies your column on Oct. 29, does the 2008 income range refer to taxable income or to adjusted gross income? Is it for individuals or married couples?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What about the estate tax? I believe it's supposed to go to zero next year and then return at the 2001 level in 2011. And is there anything being considered in Congress to change it for next year before the government forgoes a lot of untaxed estate revenue?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Len Gardner</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Leo Hartke</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. You can convert and withdraw without tax immediately, subject to some rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Levine, an I.R.A. specialist with Ed Slott &amp; Co., a Rockville Centre, N.Y., accounting firm focused on retirement planning, said the one rule you have to watch out for was withdrawing only the money you converted in the first five years, not any gains from investing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government rules count contributions, and money from conversions, first when you make withdrawals, Mr. Levine said. Any gains are counted as the last money withdrawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Say you have enough in your tax-deferred I.R.A. s that your new Roth has $1 million and that you convert in January 2010, when the income ceilings on who can convert will be history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2010 and the next four years, you can withdraw up to $1 million. In 2015 and later, you can withdraw any amount free of income tax.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN a city of 8.2 million people, where most apartment buildings are a stack of identical boxes, it's surprising how radically different those boxes can be on the inside, once they've been altered to suit personal tastes. But unlike homes in small towns or cities -- which are often single-story and therefore relatively easy for passersby to peer into -- private interiors in a vertical city like New York tend to remain private.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, though, the owners of three apartments in a prewar high-rise building in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, agreed to open their homes and show what they had done to transform them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally, the apartments were identical: 2,100 square feet, with three bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, a formal dining room and a maid's room, or what is known in New York as a Classic Seven. But each one was reconfigured to meet individual needs: one is now almost loft-like, with an open kitchen and living space that is sleek, modern and family friendly; another has a prewar aesthetic, with 1920s-style crown moldings and baseboards that suit the owners' style; and the third was transformed into a museumlike space to accommodate the owners' extensive art collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I love what each of us has done,'' said Susan Sanders, 68, who moved into that last apartment with her husband, Fred, also 68, a year ago. ''But it really is amazing how everybody lives so differently, and how we each had such different visions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment 10C</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Sanderses, lawyers who had been living in a loft in the Flatiron district of Manhattan, bought their apartment in 2008 for $1.7 million, it had just been renovated -- the kitchen appliances were new and the bathrooms had been redone in prewar style with white subway tile. But they knew they would have to put a fair amount of work into it to properly display the art they had spent nearly 40 years collecting. Walls would have to be removed, nooks would have to be created and new lighting would have to be installed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important wall to come down was the one between the 11-foot-wide living room and the 14 1/2-foot-wide bedroom next to it. Lithographs by Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg now hang in the large open living space, and colorful glass and ceramic sculptures, like the Dale Chihuly glass cylinders the Sanderses began collecting in the 1970s, sit on the CaesarStone windowsills and on shelves in custom-made niches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the view that sold the Sanderses on the apartment -- a panorama of Manhattan in which the Empire State Building figures prominently -- can now be seen from four windows the minute someone steps through the front door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I still get excited when I open the door at night and see Manhattan twinkling back at me,'' Mr. Sanders said. ''It's almost like another work of art in our collection.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While people often tell them that the space looks like a museum or an art gallery, Mr. Sanders said, ''that's not what we're trying to accomplish.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real purpose of the renovation, which took four months and cost $175,000, was to create an environment for their collection that would also be comfortable for them, he explained. ''It's our home, and we enjoy living with the art.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment 8C</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two flights down, Monona Yin and Steve Fahrer, who also bought their apartment in 2008, for just under $1 million, ripped down walls and stripped the apartment's original moldings and baseboards, Ms. Yin said, to get an open ''condo layout in an old prewar footprint.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also moved the kitchen, so that the front door would open directly into a kitchen and dining area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mommy always had a dream to have the kitchen with the dining room,'' their 8-year-old daughter, Maya Fahrer, explained recently as she sat drawing at the dining table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Yin, 47, a grant writer for a philanthropic collaborative that supports immigrant advocacy groups, added: ''I just figured that if you make the kitchen the center of the house, everything is more balanced.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. Fahrer, 62, a financial adviser specializing in global sustainability, noted that, so far, his wife's instincts about the renovation, which took seven months and cost about $200,000, have proven right. ''She wanted that feeling where everybody can be part of everything when we have company, and she imagined Maya doing her homework while we're cooking,'' he said. ''And it's worked out just like that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The kitchen and dining area flows into a living room with shoji-like sliding doors. Directly behind the kitchen, where the original kitchen and maid's room were, is now a family room, which they call a ''cozy room'' -- the only room in the apartment with wall-to-wall carpeting and a television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whenever we have friends with kids over, at some point during the evening all the kids disappear,'' Ms. Yin said. ''And it turns into a romper room.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment 9C</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel and Kate Wechsler, who live on the floor above, just below the Sanderses, have the apartment that most closely resembles its original 1927 incarnation. They are the veterans of the bunch, having been in the building close to 20 years (they bought their apartment in 1989 for under $300,000).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They renovated when they first moved in, moving doorways to create a more natural flow of circulation through the apartment, expanding the kitchen into what had been the maid's room and turning the formal dining room into a den, but they left six of the original seven rooms intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, however, they decided it was time for an update, so they could have more flexible spaces that could be used for entertaining or closed off to serve as guest rooms when their grandchildren visited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bedroom next to the living room had been serving as their formal dining room, Ms. Wechsler said, ''but we only ever used it five or six times a year.'' So they decided to turn it into a book-lined study for Mr. Wechsler, with a flat-screen television and a much-loved leather chair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a built-in desk where I can put my laptop,'' said Mr. Wechsler, 72, who is a commercial real estate broker. ''But I also have a comfortable chair if I want to watch sports while Kate watches 'Masterpiece Theater' in the den.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wechsler, 58, a psychotherapist, created a study for herself in the smaller bedroom at the back of the apartment, overlooking the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. There she added a closet that connects with her closet in the master bedroom, creating a walk-in storage space that the grandchildren treat as a secret passage. She also installed a lighted cabinet for her Bakelite bracelets, which had lived for years in a box beneath her bed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renovation, which took six months and cost more than $100,000, was supposed to include knocking down the hallway to the kitchen as well, to create more open space. But the couple decided against that, because Ms. Wechsler wanted to have a wall on which to display her collection of antique Brooklyn postcards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, the Wechslers traveled one flight up to have dinner with the Sanderses, and Mr. Wechsler said he walked into their apartment and thought: ''This is totally spectacular, but it has a much different feeling than ours -- it's a museum.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We both have collections,'' Ms. Wechsler said, comparing the renovation she and her husband did with that of the Sanderses. ''But they're very different, and you get a very different feeling from them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: 10C: Susan and Fred Slater, top, tore down the wall between a bedroom and the living room to reveal an expansive view of Manhattan, and they created nooks and added new lighting to properly show off their art collection.; 9C: Joel and Kate Wechsler, middle, left much of the original 1927 configuration intact. But they turned a formal dining room into a book-lined study that can be opened up to the living room for entertaining.; 8C: Monona Yin and Steve Fahrer, with their daughter, Maya Fahrer, left, changed the center of their apartment by moving the kitchen so that the front door opens directly into the kitchen and dining area. (pg.D1); DIFFERENT APPROACHES: In 10C, the common area is open and expansive; 9C has a sliding door that allows for privacy; and 8C retains the shape original to the prewar building.; CUSTOMIZED: The hallway in 10C was expanded to provide for closets; in 9C it was changed little; and in 8C, it was eliminated. Bedrooms were generally left intact, while baths were designed to suit the feel of each apartment.; KITCHENS: 10C was already renovated; 9C had previously been combined with a maid's room; in 8C, the kitchen was moved so that the apartment opens up into a combined kitchen and dining room.

</div><div class="author">By RUSS BUETTNER and RAY RIVERA; Charles V.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past seven years, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has presided over a historic re-envisioning of New York City, one that loosened the reins on development across the boroughs and pushed more than 100 rezoning measures through a City Council that stamped them all into law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His administration poured $16 billion into financing to foster commercial development and affordable housing and created quasi-local organizations to promote its initiatives and blunt neighborhood opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when the economy was burning white hot, as it did for several years, the mayor's plan appeared to be bold and forward-looking, a prescient decision to remake portions of the city in order to lure companies, create jobs and increase economic vitality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that vitality is missing in some sections of New York today, where developments spurred in part by easy credit and in part by city initiatives are now stalled or in danger of collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No question, the upheaval in the real estate world was primarily caused by a recession that Mr. Bloomberg had no role in starting and no power to stop. But Mr. Bloomberg has campaigned as a business visionary, better suited than most to lead in tough times, and any review of his term needs to confront his embrace of development as a stimulus tool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Administration officials say their development initiatives created jobs and housing and revitalized moribund areas, like downtown Jamaica, Queens. Across the city, residential construction doubled under Mr. Bloomberg, to more than 30,000 units a year from 2004 through 2008, before slowing this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending has also doubled since he took office, reaching a high of $32 billion in 2008, according to the New York City Building Congress. The organization projects a 20 percent drop this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if the skyline seems little changed despite the rezoning of some 8,400 blocks, the impact can be seen in old, outlying factory neighborhoods where new housing has risen, or in places like Flushing, Queens, and the Bronx, where signature new baseball stadiums were built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But things have not gone according to plan in neighborhoods like Downtown Brooklyn, which was rezoned to foster development of new office towers to compete with New Jersey. None have gone up, and other projects, like City Point, a commercial, retail and apartment complex on Fulton Street, have stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel L. Doctoroff, who served as Mr. Bloomberg's deputy mayor for economic development, said it was naive to view the initiatives in the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's always tempting to sit there and say, 'Here we are, we're at the depth of a recession, and therefore, look at all this stuff, it didn't make sense,' '' he said. ''That is the kind of thinking that has proven time and time again to be completely fallacious when you look at New York City history.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Shiffman, a former city planning commissioner, said a flaw in the mayor's approach was its failure to do enough to reap public benefits from a real estate industry he had so readily fostered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He didn't steer the boom,'' Mr. Shiffman said. ''He did not direct it in such a way that it benefited a more diverse set of populations in the city of New York, and more diverse income groups. It was basically developer-driven.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remapping the Future</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration's economic development policies started with a simple concept: New York must grow to compete with other cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development became the means toward that end. Create new opportunities for developers, the wisdom held, and good things will happen for New York as a whole. Companies will rush to glorious new towers in reinvented neighborhoods, diversifying the city's economy in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many mayors have favored the real estate industry, whose campaign contributions are often generous. Mr. Bloomberg lobbied forcefully for developers even though he did not need their money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think a mistake that mayors have made,'' said Seth W. Pinsky, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, ''is that they've really only been willing to push projects where they would be around to cut the ribbon to open the project, and what this mayor has done is to take the long-term view.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first obstacle to remaking the city was the lack of available parcels for large-scale development. Rezoning became the solution, Mr. Doctoroff said. He had headed the committee that sought to bring the Olympics to the city and had become familiar with largely undeveloped tracts outside the Manhattan core, like sites along the Brooklyn waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That sort of became the genesis for the effort,'' he said in a 2007 interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effort became the most extensive rezoning in modern city history. Sections in all the boroughs were rezoned to boost their development potential. Fallow factory sites were recast as places for housing or office towers as the city confronted the idea that it was no longer a manufacturing center. At the same time, the city reduced allowable densities in many neighborhoods that were troubled by illegal or unpopular development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The City Council adopted every rezoning without major revision. So far, one-fifth of the city has been rezoned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development zeal was driven by a projection that the city's population would grow by one million by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city hired two consulting firms at a cost of more than $1.5 million to explore how the extra people could be accommodated. Drawing from that work, the administration created its vision for the future, known as PlaNYC, which was released by the mayor on Earth Day 2007 and included a host of environmental initiatives, like planting a million trees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let's face up to the fact that our population growth is putting our city on a collision course with the environment, which itself is growing more unstable and uncertain,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at the time. ''To accommodate nearly a million more New Yorkers, we are going to have to create hundreds of thousands of new homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeding Progress</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City has frequently used money to spur development. Under Mr. Bloomberg, the city drastically increased the low-cost financing it made available to developers, in part because Mr. Doctoroff, a former investment banker, recognized the unrealized potential in some of the city's balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the infusion cost little or nothing to taxpayers. It came in the form of low-interest loans to developers, with money raised by issuing bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Housing Development Corporation, for example, a public benefit corporation intended to foster affordable-housing construction, has issued $8.1 billion in bonds to support development under Mr. Bloomberg, more than triple the total issued during the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another quasi-public agency, the Industrial Development Agency, has authorized more than $6.1 billion in new debt since Mr. Bloomberg took office -- about 50 percent more than during Mr. Giuliani's tenure. The largest pieces of that package helped finance new baseball stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures for both agencies do not include Liberty Bonds, which were part of the 9/11 federal aid package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legally, the city is not responsible for debt incurred by its public benefit corporations, even in the unlikely event that the underlying projects and other financial institutions involved in the bond transactions collapsed. But officials said the city could feel compelled to help bondholders so as to protect the ratings on its other bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For all practical purposes, if H.D.C. went belly-up, there would be some expectation of the city making good on it,'' said Doug Turetsky, a spokesman for the city's nonpartisan Independent Budget Office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times, urban planners have questioned whether the Bloomberg administration has gone overboard in offering incentives to developers. The Hudson Yards on the West Side of Manhattan have been looked at successively as a potential Olympic venue, a football stadium and now an urban village. And the city, through a specially created authority, has issued $2.1 billion in debt to pay for the extension of the No. 7 subway line to the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debt is supposed to be paid from taxes generated by the new development, but if no development occurs, the city could be on the hook for $100 million a year in payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 2007 report by the New York City Bar Association said the Hudson Yards financing scheme ''bears an eerie resemblance to the development of Battery Park City,'' which nearly defaulted and helped plunge the city into a fiscal crisis in the 1970s. And, it asked, if development of the West Side is inevitable, ''why should costly artificial economic incentives be offered to encourage that development?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bloomberg's Democratic challenger in next Tuesday's election, Comptroller William C. Thompson, has said the mayor focuses too much on large developments that go to favored builders who receive wasteful subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the new Yankee Stadium came up in Tuesday night's debate, he said: ''This is just another example of a giveaway, of the mayor's giveaway to another one of his developer friends in the city,''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bloomberg officials say that much of their lending was done to build or preserve 165,000 units of what the administration considers to be affordable housing, an ambitious plan for which the mayor has received many accolades. They point to vastly reinvented areas outside Manhattan's wealthy core, like the Melrose section of the Bronx, where city financing underwrote new housing developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some of the housing has been for families earning more than $100,000 a year, and some of the income limits expire after 15 years. The Housing Development Corporation has also provided hundreds of millions of dollars in financing that, in the view of advocates for moderately priced housing, subsidized market-rate apartments because the developers enjoyed outsize savings in exchange for a small number of lower-income units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Jahr, president of the corporation, said that nearly half of the 43,000 apartments it has financed through the mayor's affordable housing program had been for people who earned 60 percent or less of the area's median income, or about $46,000 a year for a family of four.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think that's a good, balanced housing plan,'' he said, ''and one that's important to the neighborhoods and important to the city to sustain over time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some housing advocates say the gain in moderately priced housing units has been offset by the loss of 200,000 apartments that switched back to market rates under state rent-regulation laws that they say Mr. Bloomberg did not push Albany to change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone will admit that New York City can't build its way out of its affordable housing crisis,'' said Mario Mazzoni, lead organizer at the Metropolitan Council on Housing, a tenants' rights organization. ''If you are talking about building affordable housing, the way they conceive of it is as a massive subsidy to developers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grass Roots</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redevelopment can look easy on paper, but there are always neighborhood concerns, even in a place like Willets Point, a 62-acre industrial shanty town of body shops and scrap yards near the Mets' stadium in Queens. The administration viewed it as an area ripe for economic development if the 225 existing businesses could be cleared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such ambitions had flummoxed city planners for decades. No less a builder than Robert Moses had been unable to make room in the area for the 1964 World's Fair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Doctoroff was determined to do better, through a local business group, the Flushing-Willets Point Local Development Corporation, which received half its money from the city. But about half the group's money was spent doing something not allowed under state law: lobbying city officials. The group's lobbying, has led to an investigation by the attorney general's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That investigation has expanded into the activities of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, which the city helped create in 2006 to help push through development plans following a broad rezoning of the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city awarded the group a $6 million three-year no-bid contract. The group raised another $1.1 million in private donations, tax records show. And Mr. Doctoroff installed a top aide, Joe Chan, to run it. The partnership has become a key voice for the development of Downtown Brooklyn, inserting itself, critics say, into the debate over a plan to build a Nets area and high-rises at the Atlantic Yards. It has spent some $200,000 on lobbying expenses. Councilman Lewis A. Fidler complained last year that the partnership was using public funds to promote Bloomberg's congestion-pricing plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing the investigation, city officials declined to discuss the Brooklyn group's lobbying, as did Mr. Chan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Dream Falls Short</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, Downtown Brooklyn resembled the textbook definition of back-office space. Class B. Schleppy. No buzz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after the MetroTech development began to emerge in the 1980s, and with it came major corporations like Chase and <span class="companylink">KeySpan</span>, the core commercial district excited few people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, sparked by a push from local business leaders, the city rezoned 22 blocks. The new zoning anticipated 4.5 million square feet of office and commercial space that might keep businesses from moving to New Jersey, as well as 1,000 new apartments. There were hopes for 18,500 new office jobs and 8,000 construction jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, much of this future remains unrealized. There are no new office towers. Luxury apartment buildings went up, but many units remain unsold and retail space is unrented, victims of the downturn and a construction glut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems like in a lot of places, the attitude has been like a field of dreams: If you zone it, they will come,'' said Robert Perris, district manager of Brooklyn Community Board 2, which includes the downtown area. ''It's been kind of a mixed bag here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, companies like <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> have disappeared. Others, like <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company</span>, have downsized their Brooklyn operations. New condo buildings are cutting prices. Several planned projects are stalled as empty lots. Across the city, officials say, the recession has contributed to the stopping of work at about 450 projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Whelan, the former head of the Downtown Brooklyn Council, which created the rezoning plan, sees the new residential development, especially along Flatbush Avenue, which developers once ignored, as an early sign of success. ''Is there a commercial office tower built as part of the Downtown Brooklyn plan as we sit here today?'' Mr. Whelan said. ''No. When is it going to be built? It's not clear. But as history shows, development is a long-term issue in New York City.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar predicament is evident in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, two old, industrial waterfront neighborhoods in Brooklyn. A 2005 rezoning set off speculation that sent land prices rising to Manhattan levels. Gleaming glass-and-steel structures went up. Now many of them are nearly empty. Other projects foundered on shaky financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the administration is working to rescue struggling projects. The long-stalled City Point development is to get $20 million in recovery bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, when scores of other new condominiums were not selling, and developers risked default, Mr. Bloomberg and the Council stepped in to announce a $20 million pilot program to buy the empty units and use them as affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Private developments that sit vacant or unfinished could have a destabilizing effect on our neighborhoods, but we're not about to let that happen,'' said Mr. Bloomberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, Mr. Bloomberg most likely fostered some of the real estate speculation with policies that invited development. But even those who say the mayor's development record is mixed credit him for taking a long view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For good or bad, the rezonings will probably be his most significant development legacy,'' said Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban Future, an independent research group. ''They've never got as much attention as the large-scale development projects he was pushing, like the Olympic stadium, but the rezonings are what will ultimately transform a large chunk of the city. Developers will be rebuilding on these for years to come.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about real estate investments by the Retirement Systems of Alabama misspelled the surname of a developer who commented on the impact of the organization's developments in Montgomery. He is Jerry Kyser, not Keyser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sat Oct 31 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOBILE, Ala. -- When David Bronner, the chief executive of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, the pension fund for public employees in the state, first discussed making a major investment in this city, he had an ultimatum for local leaders: show that you're willing to rebuild the city's education system, and the money will flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bronner, 64, who has steered the fortunes of the retirement system for 36 years, already had what he thought was a good idea. He would help Mobile rebuild its deteriorated downtown and its self-image -- starting with the renovation of the Battle House hotel, which had once been the heart of the city's downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, first, he wanted a commitment from Mobilians that they were willing to invest in themselves by raising taxes to pay for better education. ''Without education, how can we attract business and industry?'' Mr. Bronner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bond issue for public school reform was approved in 2003, and two years later it began to rain money in Mobile -- an investment by the retirement system of some $650 million so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the Battle House hotel, which had been closed for more than three decades, has been restored to its antebellum elegance. Its rooms and suites are as well appointed as any luxury hotel in the region, and its spa has become a draw for tourists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hotel lobby connects to the 35-story RSA Battle House Tower, a sparkling 470,000-square-foot high-rise that is the first truly Class A office space in Mobile, offering tenants the highest-quality space and most advanced technology available in the city. At 745 feet, the tower is also the tallest building on the Gulf Coast east of Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Battle House Tower, which opened in 2007, is just one of a number of investments that Mr. Bronner has shepherded within Mobile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His agency also built a new cruise port for $16.1 million: the Alabama Cruise Terminal, a 302,000-square-foot docking area that has attracted cruise ships to the city, including some that used New Orleans as a port before Hurricane Katrina. It spent $97.3 million to buy and restore the 534,000-square-foot Grand Hotel across the water on the eastern arm of the Bay of Mobile, after it was damaged by the wind from Katrina. And the fund most recently spent $6.7 million to buy the 300,000-square-foot, 34-story former <span class="companylink">AmSouth Bank</span> Building, built in 1965. It is under reconstruction for conversion into the city's second Class A office tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald Epley, a professor of real estate and the director of the Mitchell College of Business Center for Real Estate Studies at the University of South Alabama in Mobile, said the retirement system's investments here -- and its even larger investments upstate in Alabama's state capital, Montgomery -- reflected a bet not just on the individual projects but also on the state's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you are going to talk about office space, you have to talk about employment, because that is what drives office space,'' Mr. Epley said. ''So the story is one also of economic development success here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pension fund's initiatives have inspired small local banks and other lenders to back business development here, Mr. Epley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the fund's investments have unquestionably helped the city weather the recession a bit better than some metropolitan areas, there have certainly been casualties. A review compiled by the Center for Real Estate Studies in September showed vacancy rates of about 18 percent in the first and second quarter of this year, based on availability in 191 commercial properties of all classes. By contrast, the rate in the first quarter of 2008 was 12.7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bronner's vision of investing in Alabama reflects an unusual approach for a state pension fund. Most, he said, are content to turn their money over to an investment manager, and most operate from a single goal of enhancing the value of the retirement funds by wise investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Bronner has a reputation for taking a longer view, and has invested in real estate as a way to create cultural changes in the state. The approach has on occasion made him controversial, with critics suggesting that spending on economic development by building, owning and operating major hotels and office buildings isn't the purpose of a state pension fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bronner credits the fund's investment in hotels and resorts associated with the Robert Trent JonesGolf Trail in Alabama for creating a multibillion-dollar tourist economy in the state. The agency spent more than $23 million building 11 luxury golf courses designed by Robert Trent Jones, and hundreds of millions more to build hotels and residential developments that the agency owns and operates at the courses. That move is credited with helping to attract business, like the immense new <span class="companylink">ThyssenKrupp</span> Steel USA plant being constructed on the banks of the Mobile River, 30 miles north of the port city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Retirement Systems of Alabama has a story of revival of its own. Badly underfunded in the 1970s, with only $500 million in the kitty, it was limping along in the shadows of the State Capitol building in Montgomery when some civic leaders recruited Mr. Bronner, then a young financial visionary from Minnesota, to become its chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, state office workers were housed in dozens of places around Montgomery. One of his first steps, he said, was to devise a plan to consolidate the workers into several large office buildings -- largely built by the retirement system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bronner cites other deals that he is proud of, like investing in <span class="companylink">US Airways</span> when it was in bankruptcy earlier this decade, and buying the 3.8-million-square-foot 55 Water Street, the largest building by floor area in New York City, according to Emporis.com, a Web site with an extensive database on buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a $500 million start, he has guided the agency into a $28 billion financial juggernaut. Mr. Bronner is fond of dragging reporters to the balcony of the fund's well-appointed new office complex in Montgomery to gaze out at his symbolic signature -- the green-trimmed rooftops of all the buildings that the fund has helped to build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund's most recent annual report carries an aerial photograph of the city with all of the buildings it has financed taken out of the picture. ''It makes a point,'' Mr. Bronner said with a grin. ''This is what the city would look like without us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retirement system has had an even greater impact in Montgomery than in Mobile -- 2.5 million square feet of commercial and state office space -- where local commercial real estate developers like Jerry Keyser say investors are now eager to put money into new restaurants, offices and retailing in the city's downtown, including its new Alleyway project down the block from the retirement system's recently completed 395,000-square-foot Renaissance Hotel, which includes a 1,800-seat performing arts center and convention hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in Mobile, pedestrian traffic has returned to downtown day and night, said David Rasp, owner of Heroes, a longtime downtown watering hole, and of the new Royal Scam restaurant near the Battle House. New investors, he noted, are opening restaurants, pubs, boutiques and other ventures despite the current recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Battle House, built in 1852 on the headquarters site for Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812, was a cultural icon for more than a century before it succumbed to age and neglect in the late 1970s. Now it has once again become the cultural heart of Mobile, a place for posh Mardi Gras parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has all been, Mr. Rasp said, a ''very, very good idea'' for Mobile.</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD  </div><div>1199 words</div><div>28 October 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as new figures show house prices have risen for three consecutive months, concerns are growing that the real estate market will be severely tested this winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Artificially low interest rates and a government tax credit are luring buyers, but both those inducements are scheduled to end. Defaults and distress sales are rising in the middle and upper price ranges. And millions of people have lost so much equity that they are locked into their homes for years, a modern variation of the Victorian debtor's prison that is freezing a large swath of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Plenty of pain yet to come,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR. He is forecasting an imminent resumption of price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summer, housing seemed at last to be stabilizing. A flood of last-minute buyers trying to conclude a deal before the tax credit expires Nov. 30 helped push up the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price index a seasonally adjusted 1 percent in August, it was announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the first time since early 2006 that the widely watched measure of 20 metropolitan areas put together three consecutive increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While underlining the importance of that long-awaited rise, Maureen Maitland, the S.&amp; P. vice president for index services, warned, ''Everything is up for grabs this winter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers seem acutely aware of the strains ahead. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell unexpectedly in October, after reaching its high for the year in September, the board announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only hot sector of the real estate market has been foreclosures. Investors and first-time buyers have been competing for these, often creating bidding wars. But with the economy still weak, many analysts expect more foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor likely to weigh on home sales in the coming months is a rise in interest rates. As the Federal Reserve ceases its buying of mortgage-backed securities, rates may well drift up to 6 percent, from 5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries about the fragility of the housing market, fanned by the real estate industry, may prompt an extension of the tax credit. The controversial program has spurred as many as 400,000 buyers, including Brenda Colon, a nurse in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you had told me in January that I would be buying a house, I would have laughed,'' said Ms. Colon, 48, who lives with her two daughters and granddaughter. ''But the tax credit was just the kicker to throw me over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet despite the tax credit and other local and federal incentives for homebuyers in Las Vegas, prices there are continuing to fall, shedding 0.8 percent in August. The city's home prices have declined on average more than 55 percent from their peak, more than in any other metropolis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whenever the tax credit finally expires, Las Vegas and every other city will have to confront the inevitable question after all such stimulus packages: what will motivate the buyers of tomorrow?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my office, people were buying homes left and right because of that tax credit,'' said Kitty Berberick, who works for an insurance company in Las Vegas. ''That credit was a godsend.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Berberick, 62, could not strike a deal in time, and now has signed another lease for her apartment. If the credit is not extended, she said, she is likely to give up the search entirely until the market really crashes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This, of course, is the sort of fatalistic attitude that relentlessly drove down prices last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone keeps telling me, it's going to go down before it goes up,'' Ms. Berberick said. ''I hope it does, because then I can buy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery is both modest and tentative when measured against the preceding plunge. Prices have fallen nearly a third from their peak, and are down 11.4 percent over the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most major cities, it is as if the housing boom never happened. Prices over all are back to where they were in the fall of 2003. Some cities have been pushed down even more: In Cleveland, prices are at 2001 levels; in Detroit they're at 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the magnitude of this decline that makes Karl E. Case, the Wellesley professor for whom the Case-Shiller index is partly named, an optimist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While acknowledging ''there are a lot of dangers out there,'' Mr. Case said ''housing is as affordable as it's been in 20 years. I don't see a very rapid recovery, but I think we've seen the bottom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixteen of the 20 cities in the index rose in August, including San Francisco, up 2.6 percent, and Minneapolis, which rose 2.3 percent. Besides Las Vegas, three cities fell: Charlotte, Cleveland and Seattle. New York was up 0.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller numbers on prices lag behind the National Association of Realtors' report on existing-home sales, which has been issued for September. Sales were up 9.4 percent from August, with the tax credit again getting much of the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of the credit argue that the number of those who merely qualify for it -- and gladly take it -- greatly outnumber those it is precisely intended to assist: people who would not have bought a house otherwise. That means, they argue, that the government is essentially paying more than $40,000 for each purchase that would not have occurred without the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is an expensive proposition, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center who has closely followed the issue. ''The bigger threat to the housing market is not the reduction in demand from the end of the credit, but the continuing wave of foreclosures we're likely to see over the next 18 months,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, there is strong evidence that foreclosures are beginning to migrate from the subprime inland areas to the more exclusive coastal region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, third-quarter notices of default in Santa Barbara were up 25 percent from 2008; in San Luis Obispo, they rose 46 percent; in Marin County, they were up 66 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defaults in hard-hit Sacramento, by contrast, were up only 10 percent. In Merced County in the Central Valley, an epicenter of the bust, they actually fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While defaults are only the first stage in foreclosure, Mr. Shapiro, the MFR economist, expects many formerly creditworthy homeowners to go under. He says he thinks the recent improvement in Case-Shiller numbers is an aberration rather than the beginning of a long-term improvement, with consequences for the larger economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Another leg down in home prices, even if much more limited than the initial move, would nonetheless weigh on consumer spending,'' Mr. Shapiro said, adding that he did not expect a second recession.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROOFS and windows that leak whenever it rains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heating and air-conditioning units that can't quite heat or cool the entire building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Balconies with flaking concrete and wobbly railings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These kinds of complaints have become more and more common in recent months, according to lawyers and engineers who represent owners of sleek new condominium units across the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They say the wave of development in New York City that started in 2004 and crested in mid-2007 has resulted in a wave of accusations about defective construction and building design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's always an underlying number of lawsuits about defects,'' said Stuart M. Saft, a real estate lawyer and the chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, ''but about a year ago the number started to increase. And over the next two years there's going to be an explosion, because of all the buildings that were built at about the same time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that buildingwide problems often don't become apparent until people have lived in a building for a while. Legal action is often delayed because sponsors typically control a condo board for a year or more after a building opens and can block attempts by residents to file complaints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since condo owners have a three-year statute of limitations for suing a developer or construction contractors for negligence, many people who moved into new buildings in 2007 -- when about 7,000 condos came on the market -- are realizing that they will soon run out of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A negligence lawsuit charges a sponsor or contractor with causing harm or damage to condo owners. If the owners believe a written agreement has been violated, another legal strategy is to sue a sponsor for breach of contract. The statute of limitations for breach of contract is six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers at several firms said that the volume of condo defect work had doubled in the last year, adding up to dozens of buildings with construction problems. In most cases, the condo owners hire lawyers to add muscle to their complaints, in the hope of getting the necessary work done. In a few instances they have filed suits. Lawyers say that condo owners are reluctant to talk about the defects in their buildings, fearful that publicity will decrease the value of their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water leaks and climate control problems top the list of complaints. Many of the recently built glass towers are especially prone to temperature issues, because air-conditioning units are too small to combat the punishing summer sun, and heating systems can't make up for a lack of insulation during the cold months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lawyers and engineers said that they had also come across buildings with more serious defects that violate the city's building code. The most common code violation involves inadequate fire-stopping components -- building materials that are used to fill empty spaces where fire or smoke can spread between floors and apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard L. Zimmerman, an architect whose firm is checking about 35 new condo buildings for construction problems, said that his workers had found fire-stopping violations in about a third. He said his firm has clients in buildings of five to 300 units, throughout Manhattan and in Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Zimmerman, the most common problem is found behind the walls of apartments, where, say, no caulking material has been used to seal a two-inch space between a pipe and a concrete wall. That unsealed space, he said, ''is where smoke and fire can travel quickly,'' and it could also allow smells to float through a building. ''Odor migration has been a tremendous problem, and if you buy a $3 million apartment, you probably don't want to smell your neighbor's smoking or the restaurant downstairs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zimmerman says that the Department of Buildings can miss these kinds of lapses because architects or engineers hired by the sponsor are allowed to vouch for certain aspects of construction. ''There was supposed to be somebody on the job who signed off that this was all installed before the walls got covered up,'' he said. ''As nutty as it sounds, just because you have a certificate of occupancy doesn't mean you have a building that's code compliant.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and real estate lawyers said that even when a condo board discovers building code violations, it is often reluctant to alert city officials because the board then becomes responsible for correcting the problem as well as for paying any fines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James P. Colgate, an assistant commissioner at the Department of Buildings, says that condo boards are not under any obligation to report code violations. But when they do, the department may decide to investigate whether an engineer or architect improperly certified work at the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for problems like water leaks, Mr. Colgate said that a certificate of occupancy was not the same thing as a guarantee. Such a document ''certifies that the building is substantially in compliance with rules governing its construction,'' he said, ''and even if workmanship in a building may not be superb and you get those kinds of issues, the building might still be in compliance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a building is clearly out of compliance, talk quickly turns to lawsuits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven D. Sladkus, a real estate lawyer at Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman &amp; Herz, said that he represents an Upper East Side building where the developer put only one layer of wallboard between the floors, instead of the two layers required by city code to create a fire-resistant barrier. ''The board knows that's a serious code violation, and it's prepared to do the work and sue the developer and hope for reimbursement,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sladkus said that the board hoped that the New York State attorney general's office, which oversees condominium offering plans, would press the sponsor to do the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be expensive and disruptive, he added, since contractors will have to remove ceilings and recessed lighting to install the fire-stopping materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Slate Condominium, a 12-story glass-walled tower in Chelsea where in 2007 one-bedroom apartments sold for as much as $1.4 million and two-bedrooms for as much as $1.9 million, the condo board filed a lawsuit in March accusing the sponsor, Chelsea Luxury Condos, of using defective materials and of not living up to promises made in the offering plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The unit owners have not only personally observed a number of defective and unsafe conditions in the building, but they have suffered a plethora of dangerous conditions,'' the suit states. The complaint lists incomplete fire-stopping in hallways, and uneven floors and water damage in various places. Problems common to individual units include warped floors and balcony doors, nonworking electrical outlets, rusted kitchen faucets and water leaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people moved into the 26-unit building in 2007, and the apartment owners took control of the condo board in April 2008. Debra Guzov, the lawyer representing the condo board, would not comment on the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anna A. Higgins, the lawyer representing the sponsor, said the sponsor had hired its own engineer to inspect the building, and ''our position is that the problems listed are mostly punch-list items and are not considered defects, but things that are under warranty and therefore the responsibility of the subcontractors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sponsor has, in turn, brought several of its building and electrical contractors into the suit as third-party defendants, charging they were negligent. ''This is a reputable building and company,'' Ms. Higgins added. ''And they take these matters very seriously.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sheer volume of new buildings that went up during the condo construction boom is the main reason for the increase in defective buildings, lawyers and engineers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It happens in every cycle,'' Mr. Saft said. ''At the beginning of the cycle, workers are underemployed, then suddenly they're busy, and at the height, there are too many projects and not enough workers. Then what happens is shoddy workmanship, and when you have sponsors running out of money, they start to cut corners.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew P. Brucker, a real estate lawyer with the New York law firm of Schechter &amp; Brucker, said that the boom had prompted people with no experience in real estate to start building condos. ''When the market was hot,'' he said, ''anybody who had a couple bucks suddenly became a developer, thinking they'd get rich. When the market was strong, if you complained about something, sponsors would fix it, but then the market started to tank and brand-new buildings aren't selling out, so there's no money to do that anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more unusual problems that Mr. Brucker has encountered include a building whose developer built an illegal pool and another whose developer put the building's electrical system in a closet inside an apartment. The pool, he said, was never approved by the Buildings Department and may have to be removed. The electrical closet may also be illegal, because it may not be easily accessible in an emergency. In both cases, the solutions will entail costly projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it becomes clear that a building has problems that go beyond punch-list items -- a kitchen drawer, say, that won't stay shut or a closet door that sticks -- the first thing owners should do is hire an engineer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to get a top-to-bottom assessment of the building -- the interior, the exterior, all the systems,'' Mr. Sladkus said. ''That creates a record and tells the board where things stand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sooner this is done, the better, he added, because it takes away a sponsor's potential claim that problems were caused by the apartment owners. Depending on the size of the building, an engineering report could cost $10,000 to $50,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Filing a lawsuit is usually a last resort because it can be costly and take years to resolve. Lawyers say the condo board's first course of action should be to try to negotiate with the sponsor, with a goal of having the sponsor make the repairs or pay a settlement to get the work done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that fails, lawyers said, a condo board can file a complaint with the attorney general's office, which can help to mediate a dispute and press developers to make repairs. The office can, but rarely does, file its own lawsuit against a developer. But lawyers say that the attorney general has been inundated with complaints; it can take months just to find out if the office will take on a building's case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The attorney general will look at life, health and safety issues and things like whether a temporary certificate of occupancy is current,'' said Jeffrey S. Reich, another real estate lawyer at Wolf Haldenstein. ''But it's hard to get them motivated to roll up their sleeves on minor issues.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers believe that the attorney general's office is more likely to act on behalf of smaller buildings, because it recognizes that litigation could be prohibitively costly for buildings with relatively few unit owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That presumption is well illustrated by one case in which Mr. Reich represents the owners in a large luxury building that he had hoped the attorney general would see to. But, he said, ''the sponsor's attorney went to the attorney general and said they should not take the case because the apartments are larger than regulation basketball courts and the owners are titans of finance who are fully capable of pursuing it in court.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reich said he was able to persuade the office to keep pursuing the complaint only because an aspect of law was involved that could not be addressed in court because it fell under the attorney general's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for the attorney general encouraged condo owners facing building problems to contact the office's real estate finance bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attorney general's Web site states that when the office receives a written complaint about a building, ''we usually demand that the sponsor provide a written response to the allegations. Sometimes, this alone causes the sponsor to repair the defects.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that fails, the site states, the office may send its own engineers to inspect the property or have the two sides jointly hire an engineer or architect to evaluate the building and suggest solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, even when an early settlement offers the promise of resolution, unit owners still end up in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Broadway Arms, a 12-unit building that opened in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in late 2004, the owners took control of the condo board fairly quickly. When they noticed the leaking roofs, shoddy balcony railings and a faulty ventilation system in 2005, they hired an engineer to review the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By July 2006, the condo board had reached an agreement with the sponsor, Broadway Driggs Associates, to fix many of the problems the engineer had found. But Alan Winkler, the condo board's lawyer, said that the work was never completed and that the board decided to sue the sponsor in late 2008 for failing to live up to the offering plan and the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Winkler said that the sponsor had repaired the balconies and done some work on the building's upper roof, but that a lower roof still had leaks, and various problems persisted in the common areas. ''At this point,'' he said, ''there shouldn't be any contention as to whether this work needs to be done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sponsor denied the charges in court filings and has accused its building contractor of walking off the job. The contractor in turn has denied that in court papers and has claimed that the sponsor owes him $200,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles L. Mester, the sponsor's lawyer, said, ''A lot of the problems were fixed and it's just an opinion of some other experts that what was done should have been done another way.'' He added that the $200,000 figure ''has no basis in anything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years after they moved into the building, the owners ''would like to resolve this quickly,'' Mr. Winkler said. ''But they want to make sure they get the value they were promised for their units when they bought it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TWO town houses are scheduled to begin construction on Washington Street in Greenwich Village by the end of the year. The plans call for six-story buildings with facades that blend with the historic neighborhood and a LEED silver rating, a measure of environmental friendliness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these homes are being offered ''build to suit,'' which means that if buyers come along before the buildings go up, they can alter the plans to their liking -- whether that means making the dining room five feet longer and a floor higher, or making the town houses more or less green than advertised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You might say that it's marketing, and in a sense, it is,'' said Robert Gladstone, the president of Madison Equities, the developer. ''But we are thinking people are moving in a direction where they believe this is important beyond just patronage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gladstone plans to ask $23 million for the town house-to-be at 705 Washington Street, and $21 million for the slightly smaller home at 707 Washington Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices, however, may fluctuate if a purchaser wants to include the most expensive fixtures that money can buy, or to make the properties as green as green can be. And if a buyer wants to change the facade, he or she will have to run the design by the Landmark Preservation Commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to be doing the right thing and moving forward with LEED silver certification,'' said David Helpern, the architect who designed the project. ''There are some people who may want to go even higher, and we'd be happiest to do that. But not everybody is going to want a composting toilet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEED, which stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, has been available for private homes since the beginning of 2008. Its older cousin, LEED Commercial, has been around for about nine years. The silver rating is third highest, behind platinum and gold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is no buyer in sight for the town houses by the end of the year, Madison Equities will start construction using its own plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town houses, as envisioned by the developer, will earn points toward LEED certification through features ranging from energy-efficient lighting to snug insulation. Plans for the backyards include earth floors and extensive plantings, rather than a concrete base, and room for flower pots, so that the landscaping also provides points toward certification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next door to the town houses, the developer is building a seven-story 58-room hotel that will also be LEED-certified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Nate Kredich, the vice president for residential market development of the United States Green Building Council, which awards the LEED stamp of approval, more than 3,000 units nationwide have been certified under LEED for Homes since the program began last year and almost 17,000 units have registered. ''It's taken off in a big way,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes rack up points in eight categories, from energy and water efficiency to use of the building site. Incorporating recycled materials counts for some points, as does lowering energy use beyond the minimum requirements -- all LEED homes must be designed to use at least 15 percent less energy than those built to standard code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another way to build a more efficient home is to build small. But these Washington Street town houses will be single-family homes of 7,000 square feet each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is rarefied real estate for a discerning, wealthy clientele,'' Mr. Gladstone said. ''The kind of person who's going to buy either one of these houses will have artwork that will cost more than the house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some LEED buildings have turned out to be less efficient than they were predicted to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of them have not performed up to their potential,'' said Maureen M. Mahle, a LEED for Homes program manager at Steven Winter Associates, a company that oversees the certification process on behalf of the Green Building Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People sit around a table saying, 'We'll get a point for this, we'll get a point for that,' '' said Henry Gifford, an energy consultant. ''Nobody is looking at how we can have a smaller heating system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even if your whole house is fitted with efficient lighting, your electric bill will be high if you leave a window open and crank up the air-conditioner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Occupant usage can effect energy bills by 100 percent,'' Ms. Mahle said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since LEED for Homes is such a new phenomenon, especially in New York City, it's difficult to say what it will do to the resale value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think in terms of office buildings, we have seen an increase in value,'' said Michael Vargas, a principal at Vanderbilt Appraisal, ''but that's still to be determined for the residential market. But the LEED certification and energy efficiency will give these town homes a certain level of cachet. That'll attract a certain buyer segment that wants to have something no one else has.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AFFORDABLE housing has long been a contentious subject in the exclusive suburb of Darien. So earlier this year advocates took notice when, after lengthy and heated debate, Darien officials adopted a zoning policy intended to generate cheaper housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called ''inclusionary'' zoning, the policy requires every new multifamily development, as well as every subdivision of at least five homes, to designate 12 percent of its units as below-market-rate housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a town where about half of all single-family home sales top the $1 million mark, and less than 2 percent of the overall housing stock meets the state's definition of affordable, the inclusionary zoning action deserves ''five gold stars, because this housing is sorely needed,'' said David Fink, the policy director of the HOMEConnecticut campaign for affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Darien officials have begun to act on that need, however, the wording of the ordinance suggests that they still have reservations. Under the heading ''Priority Population,'' the ordinance lists seven categories of household that must receive priority when affordable units are offered for sale or rent. Residents or workers in Darien make up the first five. The sixth is for people who used to live there and want to move back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individuals and families outside of Darien are at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy reflects the tension running through many Connecticut communities as they wrestle with the issue of below-market-rate housing. When officials begin talking about the need to loosen density restrictions or contribute town-owned land to accommodate such housing, residents often want assurances that locals will reap the benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We get phone calls all the time from people who say: 'Hey, I hear you're building some housing. I could use some help -- I work here, you know,' '' said Christine Nelson, the town planner in Old Saybrook, which has entered a partnership with a nonprofit group to build 16 units of affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When state or federal housing dollars are involved, however, fair-housing laws prohibit such assurances. And predominantly white suburbs like Darien could run afoul of those laws if their policies effectively gave residents a 100 percent advantage, and locked out minorities, fair-housing lawyers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evonne Klein, Darien's first selectwoman, said the policy had been reviewed by the town's counsel and was not meant to be exclusionary. Rather, she said, it acknowledges the growing need within the town. ''We have wait lists for all of our affordable housing,'' she said, ''and we have a good number of Darien residents on those lists.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Diane Houk, the executive director of the Fair Housing Justice Center in New York, called Darien's population preferences ''highly suspect,'' given that 95 percent of the town's population is white. ''If I were the town,'' she added, ''I would want to have an assessment done on what the impact will be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The justice center did the investigation that led to a recent discrimination lawsuit over residency preferences in Smithtown, N.Y., on Long Island. The town was alleged to have manipulated its waiting list for Section 8 vouchers, the federal assistance program for low-income renters, to routinely favor residents over a larger pool of minority applicants from elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, without admitting wrongdoing, the town settled the lawsuit, agreeing to pay monetary damages and to move applicants previously passed over to the top of the list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law does allow for residency preferences in affordable housing, said Michael Santoro, a community development specialist in the state Department of Economic and Community Development. But if public subsidies are involved, communities must give equal preference to qualified applicants from groups that constitute minorities for that area -- those people considered ''least likely to apply,'' he said. ''It's not in violation to pass a residency preference, but implementing it has the potential to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Old Saybrook did not write a residency preference into its new affordable-housing ordinance, ''wisely, I think,'' said Maryann Amore, the executive director of the HOPE Partnership, the nonprofit organization working with the town on the 16-unit project. Her agency does plan on giving some advantage to applications from residents and local workers, but can't make guarantees, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zoning ordinances in Westport and Wilton do make reference to residency preferences for affordable housing. Wilton specifies a formula for the affordable units that it requires in all multifamily developments: one out of every three must be offered to eligible town employees first, and school employees second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city of Stamford left residency preferences out of its six-year-old inclusionary ordinance. ''We sort of like diversity,'' said Robin Stein, the city's director of planning and zoning. ''Maybe Darien doesn't.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stein said that in Stamford, experience had shown that when offering condominiums to lower-income buyers, the challenge was finding applicants who could qualify for a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some degree, residency preferences reflect fear of the unknown, but those fears are often misguided and unwarranted, said Seila Mosquera, the executive director of NeighborWorks New Horizons, a nonprofit housing agency serving south-central Connecticut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She recalled the resistance her agency encountered in the coastal town of Guilford around 2001 when it was developing 21 units of housing. Neighbors ''were afraid of what was coming into the neighborhood,'' she said. More specifically, she explained, they feared an influx of low-income minority-group members from New Haven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it turned out, 90 percent of the families and individuals who live in the housing now are from Guilford, although not because NeighborWorks didn't reach out to New Haven. ''The reality is that people from New Haven don't want to live in Guilford,'' Ms. Mosquera said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One New Haven family did move in initially, she said. But they felt so isolated by the absence of public transportation that they returned to the city within the first year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''Living In'' article and a map last Sunday about Castleton Corners, Staten Island, misstated part of the local name for Interstate 278. It is the Staten Island Expressway, not Parkway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Nov 01 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN January, Dan Carbone moved into his first house, a three-bedroom colonial in Castleton Corners, on the North Shore of Staten Island. Having grown up in nearby West Brighton, Mr. Carbone, an information technology director, thought he knew what to expect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new neighborhood was serene, with easy access to the Staten Island Parkway and an obvious jogging destination in nearby Clove Lakes Park. But the reception from his new neighbors was disarmingly outgoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not that the area I came from was unfriendly,'' said Mr. Carbone, 27, ''but when I moved in here, everyone came up to the house to welcome me. Now I'm good friends with the neighbors across the street.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's that kind of place, residents say -- one where newcomers are welcomed, and families stay for generations. Since the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in 1964, Staten Island as a whole has gradually become less disconnected from the rest of the city, and more susceptible to change. But Castleton Corners, a middle- and upper-middle class neighborhood nestled between Westerleigh and Clove Lakes Park, appears determined to keep what it has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intersection of Manor Road and Victory Boulevard has for a long time been the heart of the neighborhood, and that hasn't changed: its shops buzz with activity. And, in general, the houses, most built before the bridge and some more than 100 years ago, impart a sense of a neighborhood at ease with itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just peaceful, it's quiet, there are no worries when you're going to sleep,'' Mr. Carbone said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, quiet does not mean static. Leticia Remauro, the chairwoman of Community Board 1, which covers the square mile of Castleton Corners, arrived in 1992 from South Beach, a few miles away. At that time, only a few families had children, she said, and now ''on just about every block there's a gaggle of children on the street.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also, increasingly, traffic issues, Ms. Remauro said, citing a frequent bottleneck at the corner of Victory Boulevard and Manor Road. To mitigate it, the community board is working with the borough president's office to widen the boulevard and create a turning lane on Manor Road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Pagliaro, a broker with Coldwell Banker DeSimone Realty, said that the people who move to Castleton Corners, many of them young professionals like Mr. Carbone, are usually looking for something specific: Old World architecture in traditional surroundings -- something not often found on the southern part of the island, where housing boomed after the bridge opened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're looking for bells and whistles, this isn't the place,'' said Mr. Pagliaro, a 30-year resident. ''The people who want a quaint community, those are the kinds of buyers who are interested.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Ms. Remauro put it, ''We just call it 'our little town.' '' And it can definitely feel like one. On a recent weekend, a driver found himself held up in traffic for a bit along Victory Boulevard while trying to make a left turn. Needing a driver in the oncoming lane to move forward slightly so that he could maneuver past, the man pleaded his case without honking or yelling. ''Please,'' he said, sticking his head out his window. He got his way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially on the blocks north of Victory Boulevard, the neighborhood is distant from the bustle of the city, aided in part by several curvy roads and slight hills that break the line of sight -- it sits on a high point in Staten Island -- and by old and large trees that punctuate the yards and shadow the streets. Gardens are well maintained, and in early October, outdoor Halloween decorations were ubiquitous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boundaries depend on whom you ask. You'll never get exactly the same answer twice, though most residents and brokers agree that Castleton Corners is shaped like a mirrored ''L.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, the southern portion runs along the sliver of space north of the expressway and south of Victory Boulevard, between Slosson Avenue and as far west as Woolley Avenue. The northern portion has boundaries of Slosson Avenue to the east, Maine Avenue to the north and Westcott Boulevard to the west.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 14,000 live in the neighborhood, according to Onboard Informatics, a company that provides data to the real estate industry. Residents and brokers say that the population, traditionally Irish- and Italian-American, has diversified in the last decade, though it remains mostly white.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family homes predominate; the vast majority of them are detached and have garages. Colonials outnumber Tudors and ranches, and many have at least some brick on the exterior and date back before World War II. A small number of town houses are scattered through the neighborhood, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 15 properties currently listed, the average price is $462,000, according to a recent check by Pat Pappalardo, who has sold real estate in Castleton Corners for 32 years and whose company, Century 21 Papp Realty, has its offices in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in much of Staten Island, sale prices have dropped about 15 percent from their peak, Mr. Pappalardo said. But he added that the price drop might be explained in part by the fact that many residents have delayed moving until housing prices rise. That has left the more desperate sellers on the market, he said, and they are more eager to make a quick deal than get the highest price. ''These properties remain desirable,'' Mr. Pappalardo said. ''There's a stream of interest whenever one comes up for sale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen O'Leary, a sales manager at Appleseed Realty GMAC Real Estate in Staten Island, says that a detached house with three bedrooms and two baths can be had for $400,000 to $500,000. Homes along Westcott Boulevard can fetch significantly more -- some upward of $800,000 -- while town houses sell for roughly $300,000. And although the housing is predominantly owner-occupied, there are some rentals. According to Mr. Pappalardo, the going monthly rate for a one-bedroom is roughly $900; for a two-bedroom, $1,100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents have large yards by New York City standards -- lots are generally about 40 feet by 100 feet -- but those looking for even more green space head to nearby Clove Lakes Park. At nearly 200 acres, the park provides lakes for paddling and fishing, fields for baseball and paths for jogging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victory Boulevard is the primary destination for shopping and dining; thus, effectively, most of what the neighborhood has to offer is within walking distance. In addition to the branches of several national banks, the anchors of this commercial strip are Reiman's hardware and a Met Foods. There are also offerings like flower shops and a Lee Sims Chocolates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ever since I turned 17, I stopped walking'' and drove everywhere, Mr. Carbone said. Now he is sometimes opting to walk the few blocks to the hardware store. ''It's good to know that I don't have to get in the car.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For dining, local favorites include Bagel Bistro, which is spacious enough that you'll find a free table even on a weekend morning, and Joe and Pat's Pizzeria, a local institution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generations have attended St. Teresa's, a Catholic school for prekindergarten through Grade 8, affiliated with its church on Victory Boulevard. Diagonally across the street is Public School 29, Bardwell School, which serves prekindergarten through Grade 5. Last year, 78 percent of its fourth graders met standards in reading and 98 percent in math, versus 69 and 85 citywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intermediate School 27, Anning S. Prall, and I.S. 51, Edwin Markham, both serve Grades 6 to 8. At the former, 52 percent of eighth graders met state standards in reading and 60 in math, versus 57 and 71 citywide. At the latter, the percentages were 53 and 59.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan E. Wagner High School, on Manor Road just outside the neighborhood, has more than 3,200 students. This year, SAT averages were 466 in reading, 470 in math and 461 in writing, versus 502, 515 and 494 statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drive to Midtown, taking 30 to 90 minutes depending on the traffic, is aided by easy access to the Staten Island Parkway and the Verrazano.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the parkway, many express buses traverse the area. The X10 and X11 both travel to Lower and Midtown Manhattan, leaving about every 10 minutes during the morning rush hours. The trip to Lower Manhattan takes 25 minutes or more. Multiple local buses travel to the Staten Island Ferry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Staten Island's first schools, a traditional red schoolhouse, opened in Castleton Corners as far back as 1784, according to ''Morris's Memorial History of Staten Island, New York, Volume II'' by Ira K. Morris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly two decades before that, the area had a popular hotel, Bodine's Inn, whose business was helped by a well out front. It attracted thirsty people and animals to its oak bucket.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ACCORDING to latest reports from the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index, a closely followed measure of the residential real estate market, we are, if not in end-times, still enduring a grim and ugly passage. Although housing prices showed slight gains in July over the previous month, they are still sunk at levels not seen in six years. And so, surely you have wondered -- once you have contemplated the depressing fate of families caught in foreclosures, the ghost-town atmosphere of cul-de-sac enclaves in southern Florida -- what has this meant for reality television?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the high times, of course, when every wood-frame bungalow in the San Fernando Valley held the promise of Apple stock in 1997, channels like HGTV and Bravo fostered our faith in a market of seemingly limitless escalation. An entire subgenre of television arrived -- a spate of series promoting the idea that anyone with access to a line of credit could reap a fortune buying a house, installing a Sub-Zero fridge and some marble sinks and selling it at a 100 percent profit. If Jeff Lewis, the jerky Los Angeles speculator and subject of Bravo's ''Flipping Out,'' could make a buck turning houses, why couldn't you? This is a man who sent his cat, Monkey, to an acupuncturist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to the Great Recession, dueling schools of real estate reality have emerged on the air, each appealing to opposing inclinations. One indulges the pleasure we take in the suffering of the many Jeffs we used to envy and emulate who are now stuck with properties they cannot unload. The other speaks to our sympathies, showcasing remorseful buyers who bought at the height of the market with money they didn't have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Jeff, he (joy!) has lost a third of his net worth. Unable to buy anything with 10 percent or 20 percent down, he is also missing out on some incredible deals, as banks now demand the 30 percent he hasn't got. If you have watched ''Flipping Out'' in the past, and observed Mr. Lewis abusing his underlings, screaming at them for not arranging his Evian bottles correctly, and found yourself throwing spoiled fruit at his image, then his shift in circumstance will feel like a Candygram delivered from your television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That his delusions continue to persist only add to the thrill: ''I might have to start off small again, like I did 10 years ago,'' Mr. Lewis reflected at the season's outset. ''Maybe buy those $700,000 houses for 450 and put in 50 and sell them for 650.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His welcome comeuppance has come in multiple ways throughout the series's third season (which officially concludes with a reunion show on Tuesday). An adviser, for instance, tells him the market will tumble for another 5 or 10 years. With flipping no longer much of a viable career option, Mr. Lewis returns like Cinderella after the ball, to the more debased business of remodeling, figuring that with so few houses selling, homeowners will hunker down and refurbish rather than subject themselves to the indignities of a stagnant market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among his clients are an obnoxious couple paying him a pittance. They complain about everything and present him with debris from their garden to prove that his workers are slobs. The couple also feel the need to call and let him know when their midday coitus has been interrupted by the sudden appearance of the help. A study in the psychology of egomania, ''Flipping Out'' also lays fraud to the idea that misfortune builds character and makes us better people. Mr. Lewis does not become a better person. He remains greedy, petulant, small-minded, arrogant without justification, ill-tempered, ungenerous -- singularly detestable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate agents depicted on the Bravo series ''Million Dollar Listing'' (shown Mondays) seem to lack his demonic potential, offending instead with an attitude of smarmy imperiousness. Chad Rogers, Madison Hildebrand and Josh Flagg -- brokers presiding over various moneyed precincts in West Los Angeles and young enough never to have toiled through a downturn -- sell with bleached teeth and flurries of condescension. As one of the three, who moves $7 million houses in Malibu and $75,000-a-month summer rentals, explains while getting laser hair-removal treatments, ''It really pays to have good grooming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Styling, though, cannot help with the task at hand: convincing wealthy and entitled clients that the market can no longer sustain the exorbitant and overinflated asking prices they are demanding. Madison, for instance, is stuck with a nut case who consults a numerologist and spiritual adviser to determine how much she should get for her house, landing on the sum of $2,996,000. (Why? Because if you add up all the digits you get 26, and if you add up those two digits you get 8, which she has been told is fortuitous for her purposes.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another broker insists his client needs to come down and wonders how it can be that she believes her house is worth $800,000 more than the nine already for sale in the area. He has an equally tough time talking a sex advice writer out of her own anachronistic boom-time fantasies. The owner of a 6,000-square-foot estate in Malibu, Laura, who seems to have been born with the genetics of Barbara Eden and the surgical tastes of Joyce Wildenstein, wants what she wants, and she is reluctant to come down from the $6 million she seeks for her property, regardless of the new turbulence. The strange effect of ''Million Dollar Listing'' is to ensure that your sympathies lie with brokers in sports cars who wage daily war against the smug hallucinations of the even richer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If reality television can be taken as sociological inquiry, then one conclusion is that middle-class homeowners seem to have retained what they have read about the recent year in housing-crisis news more readily than their counterparts at the higher end of the tax bracket. On ''Real Estate Intervention'' (HGTV, Thursdays) homeowners, many sucked in by zero-percent financing, realize that their houses aren't worth what they've paid for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each episode features a real estate consultant, Mike Aubrey, coming in to help sellers price their properties in accordance with the market realities of their neighborhoods. Typically he takes sellers to houses of comparable size and appeal, only to inform them gloomily how little they've recently commanded in price. Often the seller under his tutelage has been out of work, forced to move, on the verge of raiding a personal retirement account or child's college fund to get by. Occasionally his advice -- which more or less always boils down to price reduction -- meets with resistance. More memorably it also meets with tears.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DEVELOPMENT has been sprouting throughout Harlem, Heather McCartney's preferred neighborhood. But when she hunted for a co-op in the hot market of two years ago, she found that the cost of a two-bedroom was way too high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She knew, however, that she was eligible for one of the city's middle-income affordable housing programs. Those apartments ''are my only salvation, if I want to stay in the neighborhood,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McCartney, 50, grew up first in the Lexington Houses and then in Yorkville at Knickerbocker Plaza, a state-subsidized Mitchell-Lama rental building. She studied dance education at New York University, taught dance in the public schools and now works at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She lived in the Pelham Parkway neighborhood of the Bronx when she was married, but divorced three years ago and returned to Manhattan, renting at Lenox Terrace in Harlem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was eager to leave her building, where she had a market-rate one-bedroom for around $1,700 a month. She lived next to three elevator banks that made a high-pitched squeal whenever they stopped or started on her floor. ''I couldn't read; I couldn't think,'' she said. ''That noise was driving me nuts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The elevators squealed before dawn when the earliest neighbors left for work, and calmed down sometime after midnight. Ms. McCartney bought a bedroom television to mask the sound and tried earplugs in bed, but ''these did nothing for the vibration I felt through the pillow,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The management company sent elevator mechanics, so she ended up with ''three technical guys in my bedroom,'' agreeing the noise was annoying, Ms. McCartney said. ''They greased this and tweaked that, and even turned off the most offending elevator at night.'' That helped only a bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She ''figured it was about time I owned something,'' she said. Her budget allowed for a maximum of $400,000 for a two-bedroom, where she would have space to run her side business, Ethnic Edibles (ethnicedibles.com), which sells kits for making cookies resembling African masks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She contacted a friend, Waltrine Cooke, an agent at Warburg Realty, who showed her a lovely two-bedroom at 409 Edgecombe Avenue, a co-op building near 155th Street. The cost was around $350,000, but Ms. McCartney estimated that the necessary overhaul, which would include new electrical wiring, would add another $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market-rate two-bedrooms in new developments were pricier, but she started hearing about affordable housing programs. A cousin lived in Maple Court on Madison Avenue near 123rd Street, a co-op built in 1995 with financing from the city's Housing Development Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers must meet strict income guidelines, which vary by building. ''Income verification is exhaustive,'' said Catie Marshall, a spokeswoman for the H.D.C. ( In new H.D.C. buildings, where apartments are awarded by a lottery system, half the units are assigned first to people already living within the community.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McCartney was initially interested in Beacon Towers, being built on West 138th Street. It wasn't clear, however, that a single person was eligible for a two-bedroom there, most of which cost in the $300,000 to low $400,000 range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was disturbed that pricier materials were used for the building's market-rate apartments, where finishes and fixtures were of noticeably better quality. It was obvious during a tour, when she was taken to some of the market-rate units. ''Even the doors were nicer,'' she said. ''The girl who was showing us around did an 'Oops!' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers often install higher-grade appliances and fixtures in homes selling to market-rate buyers, Ms. Marshall said, ''particularly when the market is not fully established.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>, Ms. McCartney saw an ad for Maple Court, where her cousin was an original buyer. A large two-bedroom was available for $228,000, by far the best deal she had seen. She would have enough money left over to renovate. The trade-off is the relatively high maintenance: $1,134 a month. Her annual income fit the requirements -- a maximum of $92,160 for households of up to two people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment even had a balcony, which overlooked the building's courtyard to the east. Metro-North's 125th Street station was beyond that. Marcus Garvey Park lay to the west.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her cousin, knowing of her elevator complaints, suggested she spend the night to check out the noise situation from Metro-North, but she never got around to it. She signed the contract and left a 10 percent down payment last October, believing that if she turned the apartment down, she wouldn't find another she liked and could afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delays piled up, though Ms. McCartney remained optimistic that the paperwork would soon be complete. By winter, she was buying fixtures and appliances. ''So now I have kitchen appliances and no kitchen to put them in,'' Ms. McCartney said. She rented a storage unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was getting impatient, too. ''You anticipate a new beginning and a fun start,'' she said, but the wait ''started to get burdensome and I wasn't looking forward to it anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She finally closed on the Maple Court apartment this past summer and completed her renovations. She ended up with a better mortgage rate than she had expected, and is also eligible for the $8,000 first-time home buyer tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She immediately felt buyer's remorse. Had she jumped from the frying pan into the flames?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As great as this apartment is in terms of space and amenities,'' she said, ''I was so busy trying to get away from the elevator that I forgot I am right here next to the train.'' (The horn is blown when a train approaches a platform, so people know to stand back, said Marjorie Anders, a Metro-North spokeswoman.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. McCartney enjoys the balcony on Sunday mornings, when trains run on a limited schedule. Her boyfriend is considering installing triple-paned windows as a gift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bedroom faces the train, so I spend more time in the living room,'' Ms. McCartney said. The living room faces busy Madison Avenue, with its squealing brakes. ''I shift to the bedroom at night,'' she said. ''It's like Ping-Pong. I have the street noise or the train noise. I have my choice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the train passes, the picture on her television cuts out for a few seconds, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I realize life is about compromises, and I'm happy here,'' Ms. McCartney said. ''I've gotten over my buyer's remorse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She reconsiders, just for a moment, when the horn sounds.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE GOWANUS CANAL runs one and a half miles through brownstone Brooklyn, cutting a disreputable gash between two of the most desirable residential neighborhoods in New York City. Sunken below street level, no more than 100 feet across at most points, the canal does not really flow -- it skulks. On sunny days, its waters take a greenish hue and are clear enough to afford glimpses of rotting bulkhead timbers, mud-caked tires and other submerged detritus. When it's overcast, the water turns an inert gray. In the lawless old days, industries along the canal's banks fouled it with all kinds of pollution. Today, the canal is mostly disused, a corridor of warehouses and razor wire, and the most enduring reminders of its colorful past emanate from several underground deposits of coal tar, which belch up oily bubbles. The residue forms a prismatic sheen on the canal's surface, reflecting shimmering visions of the landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Created in the mid-19th century out of a tidal creek named for an Indian headman, the Gowanus long resisted attempts at reformation, in sluggish defiance of generations of city planners, civic do-gooders, editorialists and speculators. But over the past decade, the government has cleaned up the water a bit, allowing the canal to be recolonized by some hardier forms of natural life -- shore crabs and cormorants, silvery bait fish -- along with enterprising humans. First came the artists for the cheap studio space, then the hipsters for the decayed authenticity, and finally, in the inevitable progression, residential developers arrived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bloomberg administration, sensing a chance for revitalization, rushed to rezone 25 blocks of the Gowanus area for nonindustrial uses, identifying more than 60 development sites with a potential to generate at least $500 million in tax revenue. It didn't appear to be a deterrent that the canal was, quite literally, still something of a cesspool. New York is, after all, a city where people have proved themselves willing to live almost anywhere, where no location, be it smelly or notorious (think the meatpacking district or Hell's Kitchen or Brooklyn's Myrtle Avenue, formerly known as Murder Avenue), seems to be beyond the reach of gentrification. But the case of the Gowanus Canal has put that assumption to an extreme test. The redevelopment process was creeping forward when, in April, the federal Environmental Protection Agency announced that it was considering adding the Gowanus Canal to its Superfund cleanup program, which is reserved for the nation's worst hazardous-waste sites. The move surprised and enraged city officials, who warn that the ''stigma'' of being included in the program could halt economic improvement indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What some people say is, 'Well, everybody knows the Gowanus Canal is polluted,' '' says Cas Holloway, a mayoral adviser. ''That is true, but the Superfund designation, in itself, is an important signifier in the marketplace.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the environmental debate rages on, the Gowanus Canal has been left to wait on the verge of metamorphosis, no longer one thing but not yet another. ''It's this area of transition,'' a real estate broker named William Duke told me recently. It was a warm weekday evening in September, and we were standing at the trash-strewn terminus of a street that dead-ends into the waterway. ''Between the old and the new, the natural world and the man-made world,'' Duke went on. ''It's poetic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Duke is a canal enthusiast, a member of the small and quirky community that congregates around it, like so much flotsam, and a member of the Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club. Once or twice a week, club members lend canoes to anyone willing to sign a liability waiver. Duke handed me and my sister, my canoeing companion, life jackets and paddles and helped us put into the water for an exploratory trip. High above us loomed a long-abandoned powerhouse for the old streetcar lines, now tagged with anticorporate slogans. A couple of years ago, it was taken over by squatting punks, who were rousted by foreign investors, including a diamond magnate close to Vladimir Putin. They announced plans to knock down the structure and replace it with Gowanus Village, a set of Brutalist-looking apartment buildings designed by a renowned architectural firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the same story everywhere along the canal: developers had come bearing watercolor renderings of an idealized blue waterway, flanked by condo buildings and walkways full of joggers and strollers. At Carroll Street, next to a landmarked retractile bridge, we saw a grove of poplars and an informal outdoor performance space that was slated to make way for a 450-unit complex of condominiums and town houses developed by <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, the national luxury homebuilder. Farther along, past a string of moored boats of uncertain seaworthiness, there was another proposed residential development site. Doubling back to the canal's south end, where there was a strong smell of petroleum, we paddled by a six-acre lot, owned by the city, that was intended for a 770-unit, mixed-income apartment complex, with an adjoining park, boathouse and waterside cafe. Then, near the Seussian pile of a scrap-metal yard, there was the coup de grace of impending yuppification: a construction site that was supposed to become a Whole Foods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these projects were proposed at the height of New York's real estate boom, and nowadays, regardless of the outcome of the Superfund controversy, some of them look very much like the products of mania. But whether they actually come to fruition, the plans have already altered the canal's identity, after decades of neglect, by making it into something valuable enough to fight over. Since the arrival of the developers, numerous competing interests have stepped forward to stake their own claims to what Bill Appel, the head of the Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation, calls ''a vast wasteland.'' The urban homesteaders who have moved there want it to remain an eccentric hideaway; artists want to preserve its postapocalyptic look; a civic group, the Gowanus Canal Conservancy, proposes to create a public park atop an innovative filtration system that acts like an artificial wetland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A few years ago, if you said 'Gowanus' to people, it had a connotation of rundown, derelict, even toxic, space,'' says Sharon Zukin, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College and author of the forthcoming book ''Naked City: The Death and Life of Authentic Urban Places.'' But in a city where industry is increasingly invisible, it's perhaps only natural that the canal would come to be prized, precisely because it retains some qualities of a vanishing, unsterilized version of the city. ''It goes back to an earlier period when Brooklyn was new,'' Zukin said, ''and it offers a path back to a time that we don't know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT WAS THE day before the September Democratic primary election in New York City, and Salvatore Scotto -- known as Buddy to friends and foes alike -- was in his natural element. Sitting in a small coffee shop on Court Street in Brooklyn, he greeted gray-haired men in Italian, reminding them to vote for his favorite City Council candidate and jovially pressing them to buy tickets to a community group's fund-raiser. ''The mayor is going to be there,'' Scotto promised. ''He's going to tell us something about the Gowanus Canal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the city's senior Gowanus enthusiasts, Scotto is a funeral-home proprietor and neighborhood politico, a cheerfully anachronistic clubhouse character. Scotto, who is 81, likes to call himself the mayor of the Gowanus Canal and takes credit -- much of it deserved -- for seeing the waterway's potential when others simply held their noses. In an era before modern sanitation, the canal was designed to serve not only as a commercial port but also as a discharge point for the city's sewer system. By the time Buddy Scotto's grandfather arrived in Brooklyn in 1898, a public campaign against the canal's revolting smell was already afoot, with some calling for the corridor to be closed down and filled in. Instead, the city built a tunnel that circulated water from New York Harbor through the canal. But that solution never completely worked, and when the tunnel broke down in the 1960s, no one bothered to fix it. ''The stench was clear up to Court Street in the summertime,'' Scotto recalled. How the canal started to get clean, as he tells it, is an ornate tale of vintage municipal intrigue: he got a new sewage treatment plant built through horse-trading with Nelson Rockefeller and extracted a promise of financing to restore the flushing tunnel from a congressman weakened by a sex scandal. Bureaucratic delays kept the tunnel work from being completed for years, but finally in 1999 it began pumping in hundreds of millions of gallons of harbor water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By this time most waterfront industries had deserted the canal. Scotto had a model for its revival: the picturesque river that runs through San Antonio, which is lined by restaurants and hotels. And sure enough, once the flushing system began to dissipate the infamous odor, life began to stir. High-priced development was marching toward the canal in a pincer movement, from Carroll Gardens on one side and Park Slope on the other. The 2006 announcement that <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> planned to build a $250 million residential complex on the canal marked a watershed moment. The publicly traded company was the quintessential suburban luxury brand, best known for its lavish estate homes. The idea that it would consider the Gowanus Canal a comfortable place to settle made Scotto feel vindicated. ''I want that development badly,'' he said. ''I mean, getting <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> to prove that you can have people living on that canal!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other builders rushed to follow <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>' slipstream. But local opposition materialized just as quickly. The divide was clannish: fixtures of the old Italian neighborhood were increasingly outnumbered by the artsy types who had gained a foothold along the canal and the professionals who had paid millions for town houses on the tree-lined (and now stink-free) streets nearby. Some critics objected to the scale of the project, others accused it of corporate blandness, but the chief rallying cry was environmental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March 2009, the City Council voted to let <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> proceed with its project, but within weeks the E.P.A. threw up a new obstacle: the proposed Superfund listing. <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> and the other developers recoiled in horror. ''You can't sell a condominium on a Superfund site,'' says Robert Pascucci, whose construction company has tentative plans to build a 360-unit residential complex along the canal. To Scotto, it seemed that the E.P.A. was carelessly throwing a lifetime's worth of work into doubt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SINCE THE E.P.A.'S announcement, all the other issues surrounding the canal, including the city's rezoning initiative, have been superseded by an argument over federal intervention. Superfund supporters say that the E.P.A.'s move confirmed what they always suspected: that the canal is too dangerous to develop. ''It's a swamp,'' says Marlene Donnelly, an architectural designer and a leader of group called Friends and Residents of Greater Gowanus, or Frogg, which meets in the back of a wine store on fashionable Smith Street. ''It's not the place for this kind of development.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are multiple dimensions to the canal's pollution problems. First there is the ongoing problem of the water. The city's ancient sewer system runs both stormwater and household waste through the same overloaded pipes, and when it rains, some of the overflow is redirected into the canal; an estimated 300 million gallons of dirty water, including untreated sewage, flood into the Gowanus each year. Riverkeeper, the environmental advocacy group, has detected unsafe levels of pathogens in regular tests of the water. ''There are extremely high concentrations of a lot of really, really nasty things,'' says Joshua Verleun, a Riverkeeper staff lawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's obviously not a selling point for real estate, and as part of its redevelopment efforts the city had already announced a $175 million plan to limit the sewer overflow. But that would do little to address an even nastier problem: the bottom of the canal, which hasn't been extensively dredged since 1975 because of the complexity and expense involved in dumping the sediment. Core samples contain a horde of chemicals, some of them now banned, and heavy metals like lead, mercury and arsenic. Probably the most vexing contaminant is coal tar, a byproduct of a 19th-century process for manufacturing gas for lighting. There were once three gas plants along the Gowanus, and they left behind spreading subterranean lakes of ooze that have since seeped into the canal's bed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Mugdan, the E.P.A. official who coordinates the Superfund program in New York, says that bringing the canal into the program is the best way to assure that it gets completely remediated. (When I asked him about the wisdom of canoeing the canal, he replied, ''Try not to tip.'') The Bloomberg administration has vehemently opposed the proposal on grounds that the Superfund process is litigious and glacially slow, and it has proposed its own alternative plan that is tied to multiple, but uncertain, financing sources, including Congressional earmarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has made it clear that if the designation is made, it will almost certainly walk away from the Gowanus Canal. ''We're talking decades'' for a Superfund cleanup to be completed, says David Von Spreckelsen, the <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> executive leading the project. He says that existing city and state programs have already made great progress without hindering investment. ''For a really valuable area in the heart of New York City, the heart of Brooklyn, is Superfund really the way we want to go?'' Von Spreckelsen asks. ''Because we're writing it off for a really, really long time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there are plenty of other forces conspiring against development at the present moment. Like most homebuilders, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has been hit hard by the nationwide real estate collapse -- it has reported $644 million in net losses so far this year -- and some local observers wonder whether the economic impetus that drove the wave of investment in the Gowanus may have ebbed. For instance, despite price cuts, Satori, a high-profile 34-unit condominium development across the street from the canal, has recorded only 12 sales since it hit the market in the late summer of 2008, according to streeteasy.com. The developers who proposed Gowanus Village have already given up and put their land back on the market. As the final decision on Superfund listing sits with E.P.A. authorities in Washington, it looks increasingly likely that, for the immediate future, the canal will continue to belong to those who are already there -- the pioneers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the economy has saved the artists,'' says Joshua Marks, a sculptor who is a coordinator of a Gowanus studio tour, held every October, called Agast. The bohemians have been drawn to the canal by many of the very qualities that its self-appointed saviors hope to eliminate. They have shown an arch appreciation for its toxic reputation, making the Gowanus landscape into a subject of their work and finding inventive ways to reuse its rundown structures. A few years ago, a group of artists took over a decrepit World War II-era Navy rescue boat and turned it into a floating gallery space. This summer, a company called Macro Sea set up some trash container bins on a parking lot, lined them with plastic, filled them with water and started a postindustrial pool club. One of the canal's most distinctive sights is a pair of silo-shaped structures, former storage tanks that have been retrofitted as artist studios by a local investor and impresario named David Lefkowitz. The past two years, Lefkowitz has teamed with a party promoter to put on summertime musical events next to the silos and the dock where he parks his motorboat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the canal's recent history is a conflict between what is and what could be, Lefkowitz has a foot on each side of the transition. Practically, he's a speculator, but temperamentally he's an enthusiast. A ruddy man of diverse pursuits, he bought his land a decade ago, and he speaks about the waterway in almost mystical terms. ''Even if the water was dirty, you could feel that magic,'' he told me one recent afternoon, as he piloted his motorboat toward the Ninth Street Bridge. We passed a metal yard, where a massive crane was loading salvaged scraps onto a barge -- a fine metaphor, Lefkowitz suggested. ''It's a miracle of rebecoming,'' he told me. ''What's exciting to people is that they can stand there and fantasize about what it could become.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The narrow corridor opened up into Gowanus Bay and then the bobbing expanse of New York Harbor. Lefkowitz explained why, after many years of trying out various enterprises, he finally agreed to sell his property to <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, at a considerable price. ''There is no other dream that makes sense,'' he said. ''The usage that's coming is the usage of its time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we headed back up the canal, we passed a group of teenagers hanging out at the end of a dead-end road, smoking something. ''Where does this lead to?'' one of them yelled across the dark green water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lefkowitz shouted back, ''Heaven!''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE TURNING POINT -- the moment when my do-it-yourself remodeling job flowered into a kind of ecstatic intoxication -- came when I finished building the interior stairs between two floors in our house. I had already gone far beyond the original plans, so I could easily have hung up my new tool belt and declared a partial victory, a sustainable peace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I had become so drunk with the newfound power to remake my environment -- to move walls and repurpose rooms and force my little home into conformity with my own capricious imagination -- that I did the only thing that felt right: I demolished a bunch more walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built right after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, when people desperately needed housing, our place looked like what a 4-year-old would draw if you told a 4-year-old to draw a house. It was cute, in its way, and, before the kids came, it was plenty of space: 850 square feet on the upper level, where my wife, Liz, and I lived, and two offices and a studio apartment on the ground level, allowing us to write at home and collect rent, which made the mortgage affordable. But then came baby, and then came baby No. 2, and then I began slipping out the front door at night and getting some baby-free shut-eye on the bed in Liz's office, with a glass jar in case I had to pee. And then came the morning that Liz found a jar on her desk and began to see the glass as, shall we say, half full.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that point, I was absolutely opposed to remodeling. I knew our home was a rabbit's warren of tiny, old-fashioned rooms, and I knew the walls were paper thin and cracking, and I knew the old soft-wood floors had begun to collapse. But I had completed a few home-improvement projects and hated the lost sleep, the anxiety and the self-loathing that came with undertaking extremely important work for which I had no qualifications. So when Liz began to complain openly about our stupid housing situation, I told her that, half-full jar notwithstanding, we had a palace by the standards of 99.9 percent of humanity. She told me, in turn, that she wasn't interested in 99.9 percent of humanity; she was interested in a bigger house. I told Liz that Buddhism (or Hinduism, I didn't know which) taught that all suffering came from desire. If she could only control her desire for a bigger house, she could liberate us from our suffering. Liz responded with an unprintable suggestion, and then she fixated on the idea of building an interior stair connecting our second-floor living space with the offices on the floor below and turning one of those offices into a new bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then a funny thing happened: we couldn't get a contractor. This was during the real estate boom, and guys were making so much money that our job just didn't look worth the time. Liz wasn't faring any better on the suffering-begins-with-desire equation, and I really didn't want her to be miserable, and I, too, found our house pretty goofy, so I finally decided that manly self-respect required my buckling on the not-so-very-old tool belt and building a staircase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, I worked with a grim, angry speed, hoping to get the whole gig done fast and cheap. I even hired some fly-by-night Brazilians for the initial demolition job, which included removing an obsolete chimney in precisely the physical space my staircase would have to occupy. And then I hit the first fork in the road: I couldn't rightly eliminate an office before I built a replacement in the basement, and because this replacement would ultimately be my own, I had every right to make it as nice as I could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three weeks, a couple of two-by-four stud walls and a lot of Sheetrock later, I had a snug, brightly painted basement office. Liz liked it so much she suggested that maybe she should take it for the duration of the project. Along with my disappointment, I felt a first glimmer of carpentry pride; just like that, I had knocked together an office that even my wife found appealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This feeling retreated when I returned to the main project, the building of the new staircase. The demolition of the space had turned up some unpleasant surprises. The walls in our future bedroom, for example, were made of flimsy quarter-inch Sheetrock screwed onto a hundred years' worth of cheap wood paneling and multiple layers of ancient wallpaper. Because I was now the boss of this project, I made a snap decision to rip out absolutely all the flimsy wall coverings in both of our old offices. That, in turn, revealed more unpleasant surprises: zero insulation, wildly substandard electrical wiring and absolutely none of the earthquake-proofing considered safe for San Francisco housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a weeks-long frenzy, with the help of several day laborers and the oversight of a few friends in the building trades helping me get everything up to code, I ripped out and replaced all the original knob-and-tube wiring, added steel framing hardware to strengthen the basic structure, reinforced one entire side of the home's foundation with new rebar and fresh concrete, packed the walls with new fiberglass batt insulation, covered that with heavy-duty structural plywood and then covered the plywood with extra-thick new Sheetrock. Then I beefed up the floor joists to stop a weird bouncing we had discovered, laid down brand-new maple tongue-and-groove flooring, built a gorgeous new staircase to the upper flat (an extremely complicated job) and, finally, painted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liz took a look around. She checked out the beautiful, solid, soundproofed new bedroom. She admired the gleaming floors. She positively exulted over the walk-in closet. Then she poked her head into the room adjacent to this new bedroom -- the office that was now beautifully fixed up for her use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's when she had a vision: maybe that cute little room should become a TV nook, and maybe she should just stay put in the basement office I created for myself, and maybe I should, well, you know, stick a desk somewhere else in the basement, like in the windowless, unfinished space between the furnace and the water heater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next weekend, Liz left town with our daughters. She had got her way on the TV-nook issue; she even ordered a Room &amp; Board couch for the space. Meanwhile, I was working alone on the one adjustment we agreed to make upstairs in our main living quarters. Our bathroom was ridiculously large, given the size of our home, so I knocked down one of the walls to shrink the bathroom and thereby claim a little more room for our puny dining room. But once I did the demo and stood there in a pile of dusty debris, I had a vision of my own: if we completely eliminated that bathroom, we could create a truly generous dining room. And, once we got started really digging into the upstairs, it would be crazy not to rip out still more walls and ceilings and transform the unfinished attic space into a truly excellent little writing garret for myself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Liz and the girls returned from the weekend, I had turned that finishing-touch project into a more-or-less complete gutting of our entire upstairs. I had also turned the symbolic corner that I mentioned earlier: until that point, everything I did could have been described as an exceptionally thorough job of claiming space for an expanding family. Everything I did after that point, I've since come to see, was pure power lust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIZ AND I talked, over the years, about how badly writing work prepares you for carpentry. Chief among these handicaps was that writing encourages the quick production of rough drafts; in this age of computerized word processing, there's no reason not to blurt out a loose approximation of what you're looking for, and then begin tweaking. Not so with carpentry, where there's no easy way to cut and paste a misplaced element. And yet, over those next few months, we discovered that the writerly approach really did have its upsides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first was that, by making every decision on the fly, as we lived amid the change, we didn't have to work very hard at visualizing each new idea. And by the time we had to pick wall surfacing and trim styles and paint colors, we had hashed over every possible choice in our endless breakfast and lunch and dinner conversations. And yes, our children did live in what my college roommate, Russ, who visited during this period, labeled a ''toddler death zone'' -- tiptoeing between power saws, balancing on bare joists and remembering never to touch exposed wiring en route to the claw-foot tub in the middle of the kitchen, where we all now bathed. But nobody ever got hurt. It also worked: that oversize bathroom did indeed disappear, creating a new ''great room.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that brings me to the other upside of the writerly approach: the closer we got to doing everything we ever dreamed of doing to our home, the more we realized that we couldn't have done it any other way. If we hoped to accomplish our entire master plan from the start, we never would have started at all; the project would have seemed too overwhelming, too expensive and too frightening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by breaking the job into chunks and letting each flow into the next, we entered a kind of fugue state of intuitive forward progress, designing absolutely everything in terms of what felt best for the two of us and nothing more. We also jointly discovered something about Liz herself, and the relationship between suffering and desire: she had been right, because she really did stop hating our house when the work was all over. In fact, she even claims to love the place, right on down to the attic office, which she has since claimed for herself.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR TWO LONG September days, I cruised the Los Angeles freeways with the ''home stager'' Meridith Baer and her two top deputies, looking at very expensive houses. Given the location, the dollar figures being tossed around and the fact that there were four of us in a gas-guzzling tank, I couldn't help feeling like one of Vince Chase's boys in ''Entourage,'' the HBO show that revolves around four buds driving in an S.U.V. from one breathtaking L.A. setting to another. But instead of looking at women, we were looking at houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most were either on the beach or in exclusive enclaves like Brentwood and Beverly Hills and were on the market for more than $10 million. Although new and uninhabited, they were all furnished with Baer's signature mix of antiques and custom-made furniture, her light palette and eccentric touches (she puts a cast-stone pig in every kitchen). They truly were the real estate versions of Vince Chase's women -- hot in a rather cold, untouchable way -- and I only saw one that I actually wanted to marry, as it were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wanted it so badly that I now look at the photographs on the Realtor's Web site and wonder how I can find millions of dollars and a reason to move West. It's a penthouse condominium in the rehabbed National Biscuit Company building in scruffy downtown Los Angeles. The condo rises over three levels, with landings on the stairs between each one; it has exposed brick, walls of a pristine, tooth-whitened white, an interior elevator in case you're too tipsy for the vertiginous stairs and more than 3,600 square feet of terrace space. From the rooftop deck, you can turn around slowly and catch views of the mountains, the famous Hollywood sign, LAX, the Los Angeles Times building, the American Apparel factory and, when I was there, the residual forest-fire smoke still lingering over Pasadena.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what makes National Biscuit Company No. 703 especially desirable are the furniture and personal effects -- although they belong to no person -- that Meridith Baer &amp; Associates put inside. Hand-selected from the firm's inventory, which takes up 135,000 square feet of warehouse space, they are exactly the objets that I would own in the urban-bohemian-plutocrat-Angeleno version of my life. There in the dining room are the Louis XV chairs and settee, the Aubusson carpet and the slightly kitschy hand-carved wooden candelabras, all set off by the stone urn covered in moss -- which I surely picked up somewhere in my travels -- and the ersatz Giacometti sculpture. There is the 30-foot port-colored velvet curtain that falls the height of the entire loft. But to show that I am not mired in the distant European past, there are the off-white Philippe Starck chairs and, in the bathroom, his Louis Ghost chairs. To show I am not a culture snob, there are the Stephen Verona black-and-white prints of populist heroes like Leonard Bernstein and Henry Winkler. And to show that I am not some prissy collector, there is the mountain bike, hanging by hooks from the ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Someday soon, at its current $2.9 million asking price or something lower, somebody, my West Coast fantasy version of me, will buy Biscuit 703, and when that happens Meridith Baer's trucks will back up to the freight elevator and cart all her furniture and effects -- the curtain and the settee, the Aubusson and the Starcks, the piano and even the copy of Thomas Keller's ''French Laundry Cookbook,'' which now sits on the kitchen countertop, helpfully opened to Page 27 -- back to the warehouse, which is in an industrial area southeast of Los Angeles. Each item will be reshelved, awaiting the moment Baer or one of her 12 designers takes it down for use in another house. This is the fate of Baer's art. It not only lacks the obvious permanence of a movie or book; it lacks even the place in our memory accorded a great concert or play. For once the house sells, her pieces leave, to be replaced by whatever the owner or his decorator fancies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barb Schwarz, a real estate broker from Seattle, claims she was the first home stager, in the 1970s. (She founded the International Association of Home Staging Professionals and the online Staging University.) Since then, thousands of stagers have offered their services to sellers and their brokers, promising that their touches will help a house move, even in the worst markets. Some stagers charge mere hundreds of dollars and offer helpful hints, like ''take down that picture'' or ''reposition that sofa.'' Others will, for thousands of dollars, prescribe a full makeover with advice on what color to repaint your walls, what shrubs to uproot and what to plant and what new bathroom fixtures will appeal to today's discerning buyer; they will even subcontract the work for you, hiring painters and gardeners, renting tables and beds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the grandes dames, of whom Meridith Baer is perhaps the grandest. She began just before the late, great real estate bubble, in a region where developers, building fast and big, often needed enough furniture to make 9,000 empty square feet seem cozy and lived in. She will provide that furniture as well as art, books, silverware and touches of ready-made character. What she doesn't have, her staff of 70, including decorators, movers, carpenters and upholsterers, will make or find. She will then bill you $20,000, $30,000, even $50,000, plus a monthly rental fee if the house sits on the market. And you -- if you have developed a house on spec, and it's sitting there calmly ignorant of the real estate crash while you panic about your mounting bills -- will pay that fee. You'll pay it because you believe that a good home stager moves houses, and because, as much as you needed her when times were good, you fear that you need her now more than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meridith Baer has no training in real estate, interior design, construction, art, architecture, fabrics, carpentry or urban planning. She often doesn't know what designer is responsible for a chair she owns or what period an antique comes from. But she has brains, energy and a rather startling degree of luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baer was born in 1947 and spent her early years living in a house on the grounds of San Quentin State Prison, north of San Francisco, where her father was a warden. When she was 13, her father moved the family to Des Moines, where he had been hired to oversee Iowa's prisons. Baer's mother was ''a wild collector of everything beautiful,'' who dragged Baer and her two brothers to every roadside flea market or tag sale they passed. In Des Moines, she also began buying and selling houses. ''I was thinking one of the reasons I'm compelled to do what I do is because I moved 15 times before I was 15 years old,'' Baer says, with perhaps a little bit of exaggeration. ''We kept moving from house to house in Des Moines, because she was flipping.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baer's first bit of luck came when she was attending the University of Colorado. She was approached by the producer Jerry Bruckheimer, still years away from ''American Gigolo'' or ''Top Gun,'' who asked if she would like to be in a Pepsi commercial that he was producing nearby. She was flattered and figured, Why not? ''I started getting these checks in the mail,'' she says. ''I thought that was kind of cool.'' Baer moved to New York and kept modeling. She helped sell a lot of cigarettes: she was a Winston girl, a Kent girl and a Benson &amp; Hedges girl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her every-girl quality -- ''I'm little, I'm not glamorous,'' she says -- worked for television too. When she moved to Los Angeles, she found small acting parts. She was in one episode of ''CHiPs'' and the last episode of ''Happy Days.'' She began writing and selling screenplays. A script based on her childhood at San Quentin was made into a forgettable 1981 movie with Tatum O'Neal. Meanwhile, Baer dated the author Michael Crichton, married and divorced a photographer and found herself, in 1991, on a blind date with the English actor Patrick Stewart. ''I fell in love with his voice,'' Baer says. ''He showed up at my door and here was this bald guy. I had no idea who he was. But he had this beautiful voice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baer stopped acting and writing; her new full-time job was being with Stewart. After they broke up two years later, she moved into ''a little house in Brentwood, 1,100 square feet.'' Having ''lived in a very cool house with Patrick,'' she was depressed by her new digs. ''But I woke up the next morning bound to make it beautiful. I bought a fountain to keep the noise out. I planted roses.'' For four years, she poured her own money into the house. ''Next thing you knew it was the most beautiful place you'd ever seen,'' she said. ''Then the owner came to town and said, 'Oh, my God, I could make a lot of money on this.' And he kicked me out.'' The owner put the house on the market, and it sold right away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This experience did not make Baer think she wanted to be a stager. For one thing, there were no stagers, at least as far as Baer knew. For another, there seemed to be renewed life in her writing career: Barbra Streisand's production company asked Baer to write an adaptation of a novel that Baer had optioned. But the Streisand people weren't offering much money, and meanwhile the broker who sold the house she redecorated came to Baer with a proposal for other houses he was listing: ''The broker was saying, 'Can you do this for me?' '' And Baer decided that she could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THAT WAS IN 1998, and since then her business has, she says, doubled every year except for the current one. Baer estimates that about 90 percent of her staging is in new houses, either built on spec or extensively rehabilitated by an investor. Her furniture currently sits in about 130 houses, and her dozen designers will stage more than 300 houses in 2009. Baer rarely stages the houses herself anymore, but she keeps buying -- hitting flea markets and estate sales and antique stores; she is responsible for the warehouse's 2,000 antique French lemonade bottles, its five-foot-tall pepper-mill lamp, its sculptured metal monkey holding a broom (''I don't know why I bought that, but it will sell a house someday'') and its antique proctological probes. She says she has staged houses being sold by Halle Berry, Bob Dylan and Harrison Ford, and houses she staged were purchased by Brad Pitt, Reese Witherspoon and Sean Combs. She recently staged 40 Beverly Park, a mansion in Beverly Hills that she says was the most expensive house purchased in America this year (the original asking price was $45 million, although it was reportedly reduced to $31.5 million before it sold).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She hired her nephew, Brett Baer, in 2004, a few years after he got his M.B.A.; he grew up in Michigan, where his father teaches at a Christian college, and had never lived in California before. He seems well acclimated, very comfortable in his Venice Beach loft and on his cellphone, which he freely put to use even in a restaurant whose menu was printed with the command ''No cellphones in the dining room.'' He declined to give an official title, saying only, ''I do the business development; I do sales; I sign-up work.'' Baer's other aide-de-camp is Heide Ziecker, who has answered phones, kept the books and, Baer says, ''been one of our top designers.'' Like Brett, Heide has a very un-Hollywood background: her father is Hal Lindsey, the apocalyptic Christian Zionist who co-wrote ''The Late, Great Planet Earth,'' the best-selling nonfiction book of the 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles is the land of reinvention, where names change, noses change, lives change. And Baer's business is making people comfortable with that reinvention. Many of the people buying staged houses in the pricey neighborhoods where Baer does most of her work are from other countries; still more are new to the West Coast. ''They have always heard 'Beverly Hills,' and they want 'Beverly Hills,' '' she says. But they don't know what that's supposed to look like. Baer gives them the luxury they expect, with just enough eccentric accouterments that they don't expect. The Baer effect, according to the Los Angeles power real estate agent Mary Lu Tuthill, who has worked with her, is that the buyers ''feel comfortable thinking, I'd love to live in this house -- look how these people live in this house!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Brett nails down another deal on his forbidden phone during lunch, Ziecker tells me: ''There's a signature look that runs through our houses. And that's . . . a look that someone lives in it, and they're well traveled and sophisticated. But they live there.'' Baer says that for living rooms she likes her designers to begin with a white sofa, then go from there. ''You can change the pillows, you can change the throws, you can make it Chinese,'' she says. The designers can accessorize however they like, ''but they are stuck with the stuff I buy.'' And they are stuck with her sense of the theatrical. She likes to imagine one bedroom as the married couple's, another as the little boy's or girl's, still another as the mother-in-law's, where the decor is more formal and ''the mattress isn't too comfortable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I always have a character in my head,'' Baer says. ''After 20 years of screenwriting, I got to see only two movies made, and neither of those movies represented what I had in mind. I get to make up for that missing thing when I go around to the houses.'' She tries to avoid stuff that's ''matchy-matchy,'' to use her term of derision, like furniture ensembles that look as if they were moved en masse from a showroom floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Paul Morrow, a developer and general contractor who has twice hired Baer, says that she's willing to bend according to the character of the house. ''In an Italian-villa-style house, she can't use her white linen with dark-wood furniture,'' he says, and one of her strengths is that ''she'll redo it until it's right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A stager's vision is always subordinate to the owner's need to sell, hence the extreme tactics that Baer is willing to use. She sprinkled 1083 Hillcrest Road, the Beverly Hills house where Groucho Marx lived until his death, with Groucho-themed art, including a replica of an Andy Warhol portrait of Groucho himself, then had her workers fabricate a weathered, autographed script for ''Monkey Business,'' which she mounted on the wall under plexiglass. Prospective buyers can thus partake of the house's history while imagining that they've added to it. The buyer can imagine herself part of old Hollywood; and rich enough to own a Warhol; and quirky enough to have found the script at an auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The girl from the Benson &amp; Hedges billboard, her nephew from the Midwest, her assistant born of evangelical royalty -- they seem to have clear heads and share a sense of humor about what they do. They help new money fall in love with new houses. Even the unfurnished houses themselves are acts of aspiration: built on a leveraged prayer, often on the remains of an old tear-down that some investor thought could be improved upon. There may be no history to the land, but Meridith Baer can fix that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not finding the cure to cancer,'' Baer says. ''But we are helping people see how they'll live in the house -- where they'll hang art, where they'll eat. The kind of thing they're not good at because they are finding the cure to cancer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brett looks at his aunt skeptically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Or acting,'' he says, then makes another phone call.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN his new five-bedroom penthouse at 170 East End Avenue, the 19-story glass and stone condominium overlooking Carl Schurz Park, was ready after a wait of two years, Arvind Sanger, a hedge fund manager, refused to close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By that time, the economy was in turmoil and the market had turned. Mr. Sanger sued the developer, Orin Wilf, demanding his $250,000 deposit back, and complaining of a series of violations of a federal statute, the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, intended to protect consumers who buy in large developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last August, when the developer put the 5,000-square-foot penthouse back on the market, there was apparently a meeting of the minds. Mr. Sanger, the managing partner of GeoSphere Capital Management and an expert on energy markets, dropped his lawsuit and closed on the apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final price, according to city records, was $11.98 million, significantly below the $12.5 million Mr. Sanger agreed to pay in 2007, when the market was hot and the asking price was $14 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the fear of economic collapse fading, and the real estate market showing signs of perkiness, developers and reluctant buyers have begun settling more of their differences while their disputes wend their way through the courts and the attorney general's office, lawyers and brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically when deals are struck, the fine points are cloaked in confidentiality agreements at the request of developers, who don't want other buyers to think they are a soft touch. Mr. Wilf would not discuss the details of the settlement, but said in a statement, ''I wanted him in the building and I did what I had to do to close the deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Related Companies, the developer of the <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center and other major projects, has made a point of insisting that it has not made any deals. But even Related was said to have been close to settling with several buyers of large apartments at the Brompton, a new building designed by Robert A. M. Stern at Third Avenue and 85th Street, according to brokers familiar with the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negotiations at the Brompton got under way after a lawyer for several buyers, Adam Leitman Bailey, made a claim in federal court in Manhattan, also citing the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, that if upheld, could allow buyers in many Manhattan developments to get their deposits back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the buyers said to have reached an agreement in principle at the Brompton was Alex Shnaider, a Canadian steel magnate with large investments in Eastern Europe. He had agreed to buy four penthouses for $25.8 million in 2007. Settlement talks, which were to have included a confidentiality clause, were halted last week, according to several people familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joanna Rose, a spokeswoman for Related, said in a statement that two-thirds of the 193 apartments in the 22-story building had already closed, ''all at original contract price with no concessions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But company officials have acknowledged that there have been ''feelers'' out among the litigants, and others briefed on the discussions said that the latest negotiations became stalled when the company learned that a reporter had asked about them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The claim pending in federal court relies on a provision of a federal law that allows a buyer in a large project to back out of a contract within two years unless it includes a legal description of the lot ''in a form acceptable for recording.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, individual condominium units are recorded in property records by lot numbers that are not assigned until the building is nearly finished, long after many contracts are signed. This makes it all but impossible for developers to comply with the plain meaning of the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But during the boom years, when apartment prices were rising month by month, and buyers could flip at a profit, no one worried much about the fine print. Lawyers for condominium developers said they believed that contracts providing buyers with the lot number for the entire building, rather than the individual condo, would satisfy the requirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dispute at the Brompton has become unusually acrimonious. Ms. Rose said that Mr. Bailey had exaggerated the number of clients he had, and that out of 12 clients, 5 closed at ''full contract price,'' 4 surrendered their deposits, and 3 were still fighting the developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the breakdown in talks, Mr. Bailey accused Related of trying to delay in order to keep other buyers from learning about the issues he had raised. In a statement, he said that six clients were still fighting the Brompton, and that others had received concessions. He refused to discuss the negotiations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Brooklyn developer who took advantage of a faculty-housing exemption to build oversized condominium buildings, then sold the units on the open market, will be barred from selling apartments in New York State, according to an agreement between the developer and the attorney general's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with barring him from selling real estate securities, the settlement requires that the developer, Mendel Brach, pay $10.9 million to the residents of the 72-unit development to repair structural defects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2002, Mr. Brach obtained a zoning variance from the city allowing him to build nine-story condominiums on Spencer Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, where the normal limit was five stories. Mr. Brach took advantage of a ''faculty housing bonus'' allowing the extra stories by claiming that the buildings would house faculty members of a local yeshiva.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the offering plan Mr. Brach sent to the attorney general's office, which is responsible for approving all new condominium sales, made no mention of selling the units to teachers. The attorney general's office, unaware of the variance, approved the offering and soon all 72 units were sold on the open market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the city learned of the sales, it declined to issue a permanent certificate of occupancy for the apartments, making it all but impossible for the owners to sell, rent or even refinance them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He recklessly and intentionally built an unsafe building that never should have gotten the Department of Buildings' approval,'' said Adam Leitman Bailey, the residents' lawyer. ''He's killed the financial lives of hundreds of people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advised by the attorney general's office that suing Mr. Brach would be fruitless because he did not have the money to make the buildings legal, the residents agreed to a mediated resolution. They say they have spent $1 million on legal fees and architects, but continue to live in the buildings, which are too tall for the neighborhood and racked with building code violations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't feel any closure at all,'' said Daniel Weintraub, who lives with his wife and young son at 201 Spencer Street. The settlement ''is a consolation prize for us because we've been told for so long that going after Brach's money is a waste of time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brach, 36, declined to be interviewed, but in a statement sent through his lawyer, Andrew Weltchek, he said: ''I have worked with the New York attorney general and the unit owners of the Spencer Street condominiums for several years, and have spent more than $1 million to help investigate and repair conditions in the buildings. Recently, I consented to judgments in favor of the attorney general and the unit owners. I will continue to do everything in my power to help the attorney general and the unit owners bring the buildings up to the highest standards possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agreement is expected to be filed in court next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until a few years ago, Mr. Brach was known as an up-and-coming real estate developer. ''He was very well known, well respected,'' said Isaac Abraham, a fixture in the Brooklyn Hasidic community. ''He was a very charitable guy, someone who didn't just want to make money, but wanted to help the needy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brach's business began to unravel in 2005, when his planned 16-story condominium building on North Eighth Street in Williamsburg was stalled by the city because of construction violations. Soon after, he defaulted on his construction loan and the half-built project languished until a new developer resumed construction this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is up to Mr. Bailey, the residents' lawyer, to collect the $10.9 million judgment, and the apartment owners still must seek certificates of occupancy from the Department of Buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement Friday, the department said: ''The Buildings Department has been working with the owners of these units to address numerous code deficiencies at this building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Brach satisfies all conditions of the settlement, he can ask to have his real estate security privileges reinstated in five years.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Sales of Existing Homes Climb 9.4%</span>
</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD   </div><div>852 words</div><div>24 October 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More foreclosures are looming, unemployment is surging and the economy remains in the tank -- but home buyers are apparently undaunted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in September were at their highest level in more than two years, the National Association of Realtors reported Friday. Sales were up 9.4 percent from August, to a seasonally adjusted level of 5.57 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A blockbuster month,'' said Michael D. Larson, an analyst at Weiss Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an encouraging sign for sellers, the number of homes on the market dropped significantly. Inventory fell to 7.8 months of supply, from 9.3 months in August. In September 2008, the supply was 10.1 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the impressive figures, however, lurk indications that the recovery may have trouble sustaining itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agents' association attributed many September sales to people eager to take advantage of the government's $8,000 tax credit for first-time buyers before it expires next month. First-time buyers accounted for nearly half of the market during the last year, according to an association survey, a historically high level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing industry groups, including builders, lenders and agents, are lobbying to have the credit extended or even enhanced through at least next summer. They argue that the credit is not only providing crucial support to the housing industry at a fragile moment, but say it is literally helping clear up the wreckage from the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the foreclosure hot spot of Las Vegas, for instance, many of the former owners trashed their houses before abandoning them to the banks, said Forrest Barbee, who manages a thousand real estate agents for Prudential Americana Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Folks stripped out the appliances, put holes in the walls, removed the plumbing, killed the landscaping,'' said Mr. Barbee. ''It's sick and twisted to say there was anything good about that, but buyers are using their tax credit to make repairs. It's helping the local economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, the Obama administration seems lukewarm to an extension. The Housing and Urban Development secretary, Shaun Donovan, told the Senate Banking Committee this week that ''these proposals can be very expensive'' and that the end of the credit would not cause a ''catastrophic'' decline in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new Treasury Department report showing widespread abuse of the credit by individuals who did not qualify for it will probably not help the case for renewal. The administration is expected to make a decision in the next few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts were not that impressed by the September numbers. They noted that sales had been so weak during the last few years, and the range of government assistance programs so extensive, that it was surprising more homes were not sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you consider the hundreds of billions spent to prop up the housing market,'' Mark Hanson of the Field Check Group wrote in a research note, the improvement in sales was ''really not that great.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those things propping up the market has been the Federal Reserve, which has been buying mortgage-backed securities to keep interest rates low. As the Fed begins to wind down its purchases in the next few months, rates will become less enticing. Analysts expect them to rise to at least 6 percent from the current 5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly a third of the transactions in September were distressed sales. In areas like Las Vegas and inland California, investors have been competing since the spring with first-time buyers for low-cost foreclosures. More expensive homes have languished, often because would-be buyers cannot get approved for loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has increased sales volume -- sales in the western states rose 13 percent in September -- while depressing median prices. But the supply of distressed houses is beginning to run low in California. That may be temporary and is undoubtedly good news for those facing foreclosure. But it is beginning to undercut the market's apparent vigor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't have it all,'' said Andrew LePage, an analyst for MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>. ''The dwindling foreclosure inventory has brought the market closer to price stability, but it's making it more difficult to show annual sales growth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northeast lagged in September with a 4.4 percent rise. But Timothy M. Warren Jr. of the Warren Group, which collects real estate data in Massachusetts, said he was ''pretty cheered'' by the prospects for the state's market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If history is to be our guide, six more months of improving sales volume and then median prices should turn the corner,'' he said. ''I think there is pent-up demand from a lot of people after the last four years. And recoveries in the stock market and retirement accounts take some anxiety out of the picture.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MORE than 130 properties in Park City, Utah, are listed at prices of $4 million to $23 million. That says something about a town of about 8,000 people. And what it says is there's a lot of money out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But real estate agents tend to emphasize the nature of the wealth in Park City, rather than the wealth itself. Terms like ''eclectic,'' ''laid-back'' and ''progressive'' are used a lot. Vail and Aspen are offered -- apologetically -- as contrasts. And references to the dozens of multimillion-dollar homes that frequently remain empty for all but a week or a month each year are often tempered by assurances that good people own them. Collective humility, it turns out, is as much a selling point as the area's three major ski resorts and majestic beauty, the Sundance Film Festival and the Olympic Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratio of part-time to full-time homeowners in Park City is about 3 to 1, largely because of the town's proximity to <span class="companylink">Salt Lake City International Airport</span>, about 38 miles away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Owners can board a plane, either from the East Coast or the West, and within minutes of landing be inside their home or condo,'' said Grady Kohler, principal broker at <span class="companylink">Windermere Real Estate</span>-Utah. ''For boomers with kids, this has been a huge attraction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This ease of access has also been attractive to builders of luxury hotels and gated communities; high-end development is a significant part of the town's growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This was in the works back in the 1980s and '90s,'' Mr. Kohler said, ''but after the 2002 Olympics there was a frenzy that didn't let up until 2006.'' The mountainsides covered with housing units are testament to this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all properties in Park City are priced in the millions. Many older condominiums that need a little work can be found for $150,000 to $350,000. These are one- or two-bedroom units that are right in town. From there condo prices go up to about $6 million for four- or five-bedroom units; some are free-standing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listing prices are down about 10 percent to 15 percent since 2006, and there are more homes on the market than there have been in about two years.</p>

BAGLI   </div><div>789 words</div><div>23 October 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>31</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants and landlords spent much of Thursday struggling to figure out what the state high court's ruling on the future of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village meant for all types of New Yorkers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate moguls feared the news would cripple their industry, and tenants worried about their rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the lack of clarity, the ruling by the New York Court of Appeals had an immediate chilling effect on real estate in New York: Landlords questioned whether they could raise rents, and some even went so far as to cancel plans to buy more apartments in buildings with tax subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's terrible for the industry,'' said Ed Kalikow, whose family owns 2,000 apartments in the city. He did not know how many of those units would be affected. ''A lot of people bought property with the thought that they would get the rents up. People made decisions on that. Banks made loans. This decision is another nail in the coffin.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While tenant groups who had spent the last several years fighting the owners of Stuyvesant Town welcomed the news, they also recognized that the ruling may complicate and extend how long it takes for current or past tenants to receive rent rebates. They also feared that conditions would deteriorate as owners deferred maintenance and repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, 4,352 of the 11,227 apartments at the two complexes have rents at market rate, up from 3,189 in late 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision complicates the financial problems of landlords like Tishman Speyer Properties at Stuyvesant Town and Stellar Management at Riverton Houses in Harlem, which paid record prices for residential properties during the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They assumed that rents would continue to skyrocket while they rapidly converted rent-regulated apartments to market-rate units. Instead, rents have tumbled sharply over the past year, and property values have plummeted as landlords struggled to pay their loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders also may be less willing to restructure loans with troubled landlords -- like the Tishman Speyer partnership that bought Stuyvesant Town -- without the infusion of hundreds of millions of dollars in equity, said Chris Delson, a partner in the real estate and restructuring group at the law firm <span class="companylink">Morrison &amp; Foerster</span>, which is involved in bankruptcies of both the Extended Stay Hotels chain and the shopping center developer <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem extends beyond Stuyvesant Town to buildings in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're not the only landlords who did this,'' said Daniel Alpert, managing partner of Westwood Capital, a New York investment bank that was part of a tenants' bid for Stuyvesant Town in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords who were hoping to buy some of the city's distressed apartments worried they would be forced to scale back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James R. Wacht, president of the real estate owner and management company Sierra Realty, had been shopping for hundreds of troubled condos to rent out, and then sell when the market improved. But after speaking with his lawyers, Mr. Wacht said, he feared the ruling would be extended to new condominium buildings that received tax abatements not covered by the ruling. He said he put his investment plans on hold because he feared he would never be able to sell occupied units if tenants had a right for a lease renewal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The issue is uncertainty,'' he said. ''It makes it impossible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some groups tried to calculate how many apartments were affected by the ruling. Harold Shultz, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Citizens Housing and Planning Council and former deputy commissioner at the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, estimated that 35,000 to 70,000 apartments fell under the decision. There are about one million rent-stabilized apartments in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Strasberg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents landlord groups, has said that the landlords of as many as 80,000 apartments would be affected by the ruling. On Thursday, he suggested that it was mainly a problem for property owners in Manhattan, where rents are more likely to exceed $2,000 a month. But exactly how many units were affected, he said, ''no one knows.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government agencies scrambled to figure out how they would carry out changes the ruling would require.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state housing agency, the Department of Housing and Community Renewal, could be inundated with petitions from tens of thousands of tenants claiming they had been overcharged by landlords receiving tax breaks, as well as from landlords disputing the claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Plastiras, a department spokesman, said it was ''reviewing the decision'' and was waiting for the trial court to provide guidance.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Top State Court Faults Rent Rise At Big Complexes</span>
</div><div class="author">By CHARLES V. BAGLI   </div><div>1168 words</div><div>23 October 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state's highest court dealt a potentially crippling blow on Thursday to the owners of the sprawling Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village complexes in Manhattan when it ruled that they improperly began charging market rents on thousands of apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ruling by the Court of Appeals may leave the current owner, a partnership of Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty, and the former owner, Metropolitan Life, liable for an estimated $200 million in rent overcharges and damages owed to tenants of about 4,000 apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a 4-to-2 decision, the court said the owners improperly raised rents beyond certain set levels at the complexes while receiving tax breaks from the city for major renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ruling could affect landlords of as many as 80,000 apartments across the city who may also have improperly raised rents and deregulated apartments while receiving special tax breaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the immediate and most devastating impact was on the Tishman Speyer partnership, which was already facing extreme financial difficulties after paying a record $5.4 billion in 2006 for the properties near the East River. The owners are running out of cash to pay building loans, and analysts have said it is highly likely the partnership will default by December. If the owners are forced to reimburse tenants, analysts say it would only hasten the path to default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Innuarto, president of Realpoint, a credit rating agency, characterized the ruling as ''the last shoe to drop'' for Tishman Speyer and BlackRock. The partnership originally had $890 million in reserve funds that were established, in part, to pay the difference between rent revenues and the monthly debt payments on the property; Mr. Innuarto said there is only about $24 million left -- only enough to cover the gap until December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The property has never been able to generate nearly enough cash to service its debt,'' said Manus Clancy, a senior managing director at Trepp, another credit rating agency. ''The interest reserve is dwindling, and now the property faces the prospect of taking a hit on its income.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its decision, the court acknowledged that the developers had predicted ''dire circumstances for our ruling, for themselves and the New York City real estate industry generally.'' But the court pointed out that numerous unresolved issues could reduce the amount of money the owners may have to repay, and said that ''if the statute imposes unacceptable burdens, defendants' remedy is to seek legislative relief.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing boom in 2006, the Tishman Speyer partnership, like other investors at the time, bought the complexes with aggressive plans to convert rent-regulated apartments to market-rate rents by weeding out tenants who it said did not qualify for rent regulation and by raising rents on vacant apartments after major renovations. The partners had planned to convert half the apartments by 2011, but the process has proven far more difficult and time consuming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after the Tishman Speyer partnership took over, nine tenants of seven apartments in the complexes filed suit claiming that the landlord had improperly raised rents for thousands of market-rate tenants while collecting more than $24 million in tax breaks since 1992 under the city's J-51 housing program. The program was intended to encourage landlords to rehabilitate their properties by providing tax breaks on the cost of various building improvements or renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ruled the landlords had indeed improperly raised rents and decontrolled apartments. That decision galvanized the real estate industry, which submitted briefs on behalf of the Tishman Speyer partnership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They argued the court had misread the state law and had overturned ''15 years of real estate industry practice that had been endorsed by two government agencies with primary responsibilities in this area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander H. Schmidt, a lawyer who represented the original nine plaintiffs in the class-action case, said he hoped the current and former owners would quickly resolve the class members' rent overcharge claims by ''settling this case, and ending the litigation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evan Horisk, a plaintiff in the case, was elated. He left Stuyvesant Town in 2007 after Tishman Speyer notified him that the rent for his two-bedroom market-rate apartment would jump 26 percent to $3,350, from $2,660 per month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When it comes to someone's home -- their most important place -- we must prevent predatory corporations from shuffling their money around at our expense,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a strongly worded dissent written by Judge Susan P. Read, the idea that the developers' ''losses ultimately will turn on legal issues and defenses yet to be resolved is cold comfort.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the absence of meaningful legislative action, uncertainty will reign in an industry already rocked by the bursting of the great residential real estate bubble,'' the dissent continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer released a statement characterizing the decision as ''an unfortunate outcome for New York.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Innuarto, the credit rating analyst, said the ruling was likely to accelerate the process by which the lenders turn to a ''special servicer'' to oversee the property because of the imminent danger of default on about $4.4 billion in loans. Tishman Speyer Properties would lose only the $56 million it put into the deal, while its partners, investors and lenders would take a far bigger hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ruling did not specify a remedy; developers fear they could have to pay treble damages and rent rebates dating back as many as four years, or to the point at which an apartment was deregulated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about one million apartments with regulated rents in the city. Over the past two decades, landlords have lobbied successfully to loosen those restrictions. Under state law, landlords can deregulate an apartment when the rent for a vacant unit reaches $2,000 or more per month, or when the rent is above $2,000 and a tenant's household income is above $175,000 for two consecutive years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the apartment is deregulated, there are no restrictions on the landlord's ability to raise the rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords are also allowed to pass along a portion of the cost of major renovations to tenants. At Stuyvesant Town, for instance, the landlord routinely spent about $40,000 renovating vacant apartments and as a result was able to raise rents by $1,000 a month. The total rent would then exceed the $2,000 threshold and the landlord was permitted to charge market rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents 25,000 landlords and building managers, said it was clear the ruling has the ''potential to force some buildings into bankruptcy or foreclosure if they're required to roll back rents, but it would also have a direct impact on the city budget.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHARLES V. BAGLI   </div><div>589 words</div><div>22 October 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>30</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After five consecutive years in which residential construction in New York exceeded 30,000 apartments and houses annually, fewer than 6,300 units will be built this year, according to the latest report from the New York Building Congress, an industry trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The abrupt reversal of fortunes in the residential market is one of the main reasons that construction spending is expected to fall by 20 percent this year to $25.8 billion, from a peak of $32.4 billion in 2008, according to an annual report released by the group on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending is down in just about every category, including hotels, office buildings and public works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bright spot is that the situation could have been worse, said Richard T. Anderson, president of the Building Congress. A year ago, the group forecast a 30 percent drop, with as many as 30,000 construction workers losing their jobs. It turns out, the report says, that the industry has lost 11,000 jobs this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a declining construction market,'' Mr. Anderson said, ''but not as much as we anticipated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, the report contends that the downturn may have bottomed out. Construction spending is not expected to fall below $25 billion in 2010 or 2011, although Mr. Anderson acknowledged that some industry executives were more pessimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're way too exuberant,'' the developer Douglas Durst said of the report. Commercial vacancy rates are continuing to rise, he said, and rents are falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the report shows a sharp drop in the construction of office towers, with only two buildings, the Diamond Center on West 47th Street and 1 World Trade Center , under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear whether three other office towers at the former World Trade Center site will be built soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Boston Properties canceled two proposed office buildings on Eighth Avenue, and <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> abandoned plans for a tower over the Port Authority Bus Terminal. And the nearly completed 40-story tower at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue, 11 Times Square, still does not have a tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think you'll see another new commercial building for some time,'' Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residential market is more bleak. More than 460 residential projects have been delayed, nearly a third of them in Brooklyn, according to the latest figures from the city's Buildings Department. Many analysts say it will take several years for the market to absorb all the luxury apartments that have been built recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the slowdown, Mr. Anderson said, construction spending in 2009 will be 45 percent greater than it was in 2004. Government spending, which is expected to account for 60 percent of construction activity this year in New York City, has held up better than expected, according to the report. The city's capital spending program has remained above $10 billion, with much of the money going to schools, the extension of the No. 7 subway line and a water filtration plant in the Bronx. <span class="companylink">The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span> is also spending billions of dollars rebuilding the World Trade Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the future is uncertain, given the multibillion-dollar financing gap in the state budget. The Port Authority has also been forced to stretch out its capital projects with the drop in revenue from bridges and tunnels. And the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is struggling financially and may have to postpone its five-year capital program.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Oct. 22 about the writer Augusten Burroughs's home in Battery Park City misstated a word in a quotation regarding his writing process. Mr. Burroughs said: ''I write from memory. And I have my diaries'' (not ''dairies'').</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Thu Nov 12 2009</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''THIS is the first apartment I've ever owned,'' Augusten Burroughs said. ''Wouldn't you know it would be in a building where the developer went bankrupt and fled the country?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It does seem an oddly appropriate backdrop for the gothic serial memoirist, who turns 44 on Friday. While it is not clear if Yair Levy, the developer of Mr. Burroughs's new home at 225 Rector Place, a condominium in Battery Park City, actually fled the country, it is true that the building's ill-fated conversion process has been as dysfunctional and miserable as a tale from Mr. Burroughs's own famously dysfunctional and miserable childhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Levy, the developer, has had an awful year: his other condominium, Sheffield57, which he bought for $418 million with a partner, Ken Swig, went into foreclosure in August, and last fall, Mr. Levy was charged with assaulting Mr. Swig with an ice bucket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Burroughs worried that he had brought his own bad luck to the building. Indeed, in 2005 when he built a house with his former partner, Dennis Pilsits, in Amherst, Mass., Mr. Burroughs said he installed lightning protection, ''because I'm the sort of person who gets struck by lightning.'' Instead, the house flooded, wrecking the place their first Christmas there. This tale and others are collected in ''You Better Not Cry,'' Mr. Burroughs's seventh book, out next week, a slim handful of hapless holiday stories, including one detailing a wincingly gross tryst with an aging sidewalk Santa. (Mr. Burroughs describes him with typical pungency as ''Ebola in need of a back wax.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we are digressing from the horror at hand: With Mr. Burroughs's Battery Park building now in receivership, its creditor, <span class="companylink">Anglo Irish Bank</span>, has begun foreclosure proceedings against its developer. Meanwhile, Mr. Burroughs and the other 50-plus unit owners in the beleaguered building -- all of whom endured days without heat or hot water last winter, and have been tiptoeing around a maze of live wires and drywall in their empty, unfinished halls for nearly a year -- are requesting that they be included in the foreclosure proceedings, as they endeavor to wring some sort of justice from their experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not that I could sell you this place for $15 now,'' said Mr. Burroughs, who paid $625,000 in cash for his studio apartment last year. But he has no regrets. On the contrary, of all the owners, he may be the happiest, despite some personal travails we will get to later. (Also, he probably has the deepest pockets here; most residents, he said, are young, first-time buyers who have sunk all their money into their apartments, which at this point they can neither sell nor refinance.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Mr. Burroughs, his apartment is weirdly, comfortably home. ''It fits the person I am,'' he said. ''Not the person I'd like to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent afternoon, Mr. Burroughs, lanky and boyish despite the tattoos curling around his forearms, was stretched out on the king-size four-poster bed he has set smack in the middle of the apartment. Draped and swagged in a manner that would please the Libyan dictator, the bed is a sumptuous galleon and office for him. Little seating arrangements ring the tiny room, which he decorated this summer, downloading photos of art, furniture and objects found on 1stdibs, shrinking them to scale and laying them out on a floor plan using Gimp, a Photoshop-like program from Linux, the free operating system that Mr. Burroughs compared with Alcoholics Anonymous: ''You can get help from total strangers anywhere in the world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burroughs, who skipped college and most of high school, but did spend nine months at the Control Data Institute, he said, quoting its jingle -- ''Train for tomorrow's future today!'' -- is something of a tech geek. Born Christopher Robison, he changed his name on his 18th birthday to Augusten Xon Burroughs, deriving his three new names thusly: Burroughs was once a manufacturer of mainframe computers; ''xon'' was computer-speak for ''in a state of accepting input''; and ''Augusten just sounded cool and modern,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've micromanaged everything here,'' he said, directing a visitor to a spot on the Borge Mogensen sofa at the foot of his bed. ''What do you see?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A very nice view of the Statue of Liberty, as it happens. You can also see the shaded windows of what Mr. Burroughs said was his first Manhattan apartment, chosen because he had seen the lights of Battery Park City from a plane once and had an experience akin to Gatsby's, gazing at the lights on Daisy's dock. Not that he explained it that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I grabbed my boss's Marimekko blazer and said, 'God, I want to live there,' '' is how he put it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A serious affair with a man he nicknamed ''Pighead'' -- which began, as careful readers of the Burroughs oeuvre will remember from ''Dry,'' his rehab memoir, when the two started joking around on a phone sex line -- makes Battery Park City a memento mori. Pighead was George Stathakis, a Wall Street broker who worked in an office across the West Side Highway; the two met in person at the Winter Garden. Mr. Stathakis died of complications from AIDS in 1998, an event that sent Mr. Burroughs on one of his last epic benders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, sober for nearly a year, he met Mr. Pilsits, who had placed a personal advertisement online. ''It was all very old-fashioned,'' Mr. Burroughs said. ''We'd go out on dates, have dinner and then go home. Separately.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a year, Mr. Burroughs moved into Mr. Pilsits's Upper West Side apartment. The rest is publishing history: Mr. Burroughs's first, Dickensian memoir, ''Running With Scissors,'' spent four years on the best-seller lists. Five books followed, each more chaotic than the last, all best sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Running With Scissors,'' the movie starring Annette Bening and Gwyneth Paltrow, was released in 2006. That same year, Mr. Burroughs and his publisher, St. Martin's Press, were sued for libel by the Turcotte family, the real-life version of the family Mr. Burroughs memorialized in ''Scissors'' as the Finches, into whose gothic, Grey Gardens-esque home Mr. Burroughs moved as a teenager when his mentally ill mother went off the deep end. The suit was settled for an undisclosed sum in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have been asked for years, 'How do you know it's true?' And I just do,'' he said. ''I write from memory. And I have my dairies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that a psychiatrist had recently diagnosed his ''sensory processing disorder,'' a condition of heightened physical and mental sensitivity that Mr. Burroughs claimed causes him to retain experiences more vividly than the rest of us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, his last book, a grim depiction of his alcoholic father called ''A Wolf at the Table,'' was published to wildly mixed reviews. ''Determinedly unfunny, awkwardly histrionic and sometimes anything but credible, it repudiates everything that put Mr. Burroughs on the map,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. His publisher said it has been his best-selling hardcover to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. Pilsits, who had been running a graphic design firm, began taking on more and more of the financial side of ''Augusten Burroughs, the business,'' a thriving and complex commercial entity comprising not just the books but also television projects and a steady schedule of college speaking engagements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He didn't suddenly walk in and take over,'' Mr. Burroughs said. ''But he had ideas about starting anLLC and having good lawyers, and when he saw my lack of, um, excitement when discussing this topic, he just assumed the role.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In hindsight, Mr. Burroughs rues this development. ''It allowed me to remain emotionally crippled,'' he said, ''and it allowed Dennis to not think about what it was he really wanted to do with his life and grow increasingly dissatisfied.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not immediately. In 2005, he and Mr. Pilsits built a house in Amherst, next door to Mr. Burroughs's brother, John Elder Robison, author of his own memoir about living with Asperger syndrome. (Watch for a memoir from their mother, Margaret Robison, sometime in the next year or so.) And they sold Mr. Pilsits's apartment to buy the Battery Park City place, which they signed a contract for nearly two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burroughs described the brokers -- the ''sleek creatures in Prada'' -- the sleek office on the main floor of the building and the seductive floor plans. But by December of last year, it was clear that something was very wrong. The brokers and their fancy office had vanished, along with all the construction workers, leaving the building looking like a war zone, said the residents' lawyer, Marc Held. In February, residents learned the building's bank accounts were empty, the developer was broke and the building was just days away from losing not only its staff but also basic amenities like hot water and electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local politicians began to agitate on the residents' behalf, and receivership followed. By last month, the lobby and common areas were very nearly finished, though the fate of the building -- who will buy it and what sort of redress the residents may receive -- is unknown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet as the building moved toward normalcy, Mr. Pilsits and Mr. Burroughs grew apart, finally splitting over the summer. And Mr. Burroughs panicked; the apartment held only an air mattress and dog beds (Mr. Pilsits has the couple's two French bulldogs). ''I told Dennis, 'I better do this place up right away because it's me that's going to be living in this bankrupt mess of a building,' '' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in typical Burroughs fashion, grim reality was soon transformed. Whatever you think of his source material, Mr. Burroughs is a skilled survivor, still the architect of his own very good fortune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last story in ''You Better Not Cry'' tells of the days leading up to the first Christmas in Mr. Burroughs's and Mr. Pilsits's house: there is the flood, the wrecked house, a flotilla of dehumidifiers and a trashed Christmas tree. By Christmas Eve, however, Mr. Pilsits has salvaged the tree and silenced the dehumidifiers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Mr. Burroughs said: ''I'm here and he's there, and we still love each other. We are closer than we've ever been because we are talking. I don't know what will happen, but I know it will be O.K.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With both Los Angeles area teams in the league championship series, you might expect that fans there, in the nation's second-largest market, would watch in mass quantities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">O.K., it could not have been easy for local fans to watch the Angels lose their first two games to the Yankees and the Dodgers lose two out of three to the Phillies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the story is that the Los Angeles market is being drubbed by New York and Philadelphia. Maybe it's the old time-zone thing that limits viewership in the West Coast because what starts at 8 o'clock in New York begins at 5 in Santa Monica. Perhaps Angelenos have more amusing diversions. Maybe it's the cold and the rain in the East keeping fans inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or maybe old baseball cities like New York, Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia tend to support their teams in greater numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, to the National League Championship Series on TBS. The Los Angeles market peaked with a 10.9 rating for the Dodgers' Game 1 loss to the Phillies, according to Nielsen Media figures. That game showed substantial growth during the game, with the rating more than doubling to a 14.8 in the late innings from a 7.1 early on. But the Dodgers' afternoon victory in Game 2 produced a 5.9, and Sunday night's 11-0 loss generated just a 7.3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A closer look at Game 3 reveals a well-earned dissatisfaction among hometown Dodgers fans as the debacle unfolded. The game peaked at a 9.6 locally (or 543,000 households) from 8:15 to 8:30 p.m. Eastern -- it had barely begun -- and as the Phillies took a 6-0 lead in the second inning, the rating tumbled until it finished with a 4.3 (242,000 homes).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-quarter of all TV homes have been watching the games in Philadelphia. The game-by-game ratings there would please Ben Franklin: Game 1, a 27.7; Game 2, a 22.2; and Game 3, a 29.1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not easy for a market with 2.95 million TV homes to beat one with nearly twice as many, but that's what Philadelphia has been doing to Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Los Angeles market is losing to New York in the Angels-Yankees American League Championship Series on Fox, but not as sharply. For Game 1, the New York rating of a 17.4 (1.3 million homes) was 83 percent better the 9.1 (or 514,000 homes) in Los Angeles. For the 13-inning Game 2, which started in late afternoon on the West Coast, the Los Angeles market produced a 10.8 (610,000 homes) and New York a 19.3 (1.4 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Yankees' 4-3 win over the Angels in Game 2 demonstrated that a game that ends after 1 a.m. in the East would not exhaust viewership, at least in the teams' markets. In the last half-hour of the game, the rating in Los Angeles broke the 15.0 level for the only time in the series, and the game was being seen by 874,000 homes at 10 p.m. Pacific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, in New York, the local rating had sagged a little from its height at about 11:15 p.m. Eastern, but was still a 20.3 with 1.5 million households watching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Los Angeles market's behavior is not an aberration. During last year's N.L.C.S., also between the Dodgers and the Phillies, the five games averaged a 10.7 in the Los Angeles market -- and a 25.9 in Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when the Angels played the White Sox in the 2005 A.L.C.S., the games rated an average 15.8 in Los Angeles -- and a 26.4 in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BASEBALL VS. FOOTBALL On a weekend with the Yankees playing an epic game Saturday night and the Giants and the Jets losing Sunday afternoon, which did best in the local ratings? The Yankees, with the 19.3, beat the 16.2 for the Saints' rout of the Giants and the astonishing 17.1 for the achingly awful Jets loss to Buffalo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jets broadcast, on CBS, had the benefit of starting at 4:15 p.m. Eastern. It lasted four numbing hours and finished around 8:15. I know the masochism of being a Jets fan; I sometimes admit that I am one. But so many viewers stood by for so long that you'd have thought Woody Johnson was slashing the prices of personal seat licenses. The rating for the game pushed past a 21.2 at 7:30, climbed to a 22.5 at 7:45 and ended with a 23.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The game could prompt aggrieved fans to file a class-action suit to be compensated for the time spent waiting fruitlessly for a victory. A creative lawyer might ponder a test case of 5,000 fans whose pain and suffering is worth $50 for each of the four hours of viewing. Imagine the fun. It could start a movement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CLEVELAND -- The first night after she surrendered her house to foreclosure, Sheri West endured the darkness in her Hyundai sedan. She parked in her old driveway, with her flower-print dresses and hats piled in boxes on the back seat, and three cherished houseplants on the floor. She used her backyard as a restroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second night, she stayed with a friend, and so it continued for more than a year: Ms. West -- mother of three grown children, grandmother to six and great-grandmother to one -- passed months on the couches of friends and relatives, and in the front seat of her car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this fall, she exhausted all options. She had once owned and overseen a group home for homeless people. Now, she succumbed to that status herself, checking in to a shelter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one could have told me that in a million years: I'd wake up in a homeless shelter,'' she said. ''I had a house for homeless people. Now, I'm homeless.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing numbers of Americans who have lost houses to foreclosure are landing in homeless shelters, according to social service groups and a recent report by a coalition of housing advocates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only three years ago, foreclosure was rarely a factor in how people became homeless. But among the homeless people that social service agencies have helped over the last year, an average of 10 percent lost homes to foreclosure, according to ''Foreclosure to Homelessness 2009,'' a survey produced by the National Coalition for the Homeless and six other advocacy groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Midwest, foreclosure played a role for 15 percent of newly homeless people, according to the survey, reflecting soaring rates of unemployment -- Ohio's reached 10.8 percent in August -- and aggressive lending to people with damaged credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a shelter for women and children run by the West Side Catholic Center in Cleveland, where Ms. West now lives, foreclosure accounted for zero arrivals in 2007, the center's executive director, Gerald Skoch, said. Last year, two cases emerged. This year, the number has already reached four.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar increases have been reported at shelters in California, Michigan and Florida, where a combination of joblessness and the real estate bust have generated unusually severe rates of foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people who become homeless because of foreclosure had been low-income renters whose landlords stopped making their mortgage payments, leaving them scrambling for new housing with little notice and scant savings, according to the survey and interviews with shelters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in recent months, there has been a visible increase in the number of former homeowners showing up in shelters. Like Ms. West, most have landed there after months trying to stave off that fate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These families never needed help before,'' said Larry Haynes, executive director of Mercy House in Santa Ana, Calif. ''They haven't a clue about where to go, and they have all sorts of humiliation issues. They don't even know what to say, what to ask for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many start off camping out in cars, particularly in warmer places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've seen a rise in people sleeping in their cars,'' said Rick Cole, city manager in Ventura, Calif., which recently allowed car-camping in designated areas. ''Some are foreclosed former homeowners, and some couldn't afford their rent. People will give up their house before they give up their car.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those with means try to rent homes or apartments, though tainted credit often makes that impossible. Growing numbers are landing in motels that rent by the week, cramming whole families into single rooms and using hot plates as kitchens. But as unemployment expands, many are losing the wherewithal to remain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many take refuge with families and friends, occupying extra bedrooms, basements and attics. But such hospitality rarely lasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, as lean times endure and paychecks disappear, homeless shelters are absorbing those who have run out of alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Ms. West, whose youthful appearance belies her age, in her mid-50s, the nights spent on couches in other people's homes were uncomfortably familiar. She grew up an only child in a housing project in Neptune, N.J., where her mother slept in the lone bedroom, and she occupied a pullout sofa in the living room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've always had this dream of doing better,'' she said. ''I always wanted to own my own house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She realized that dream shortly after arriving in Cleveland with her husband and two children in the early 1990s. At first, they rented. But one fall afternoon, Ms. West found herself on a block lined with leafy trees in Mount Pleasant, a neighborhood east of the Cuyahoga River that was a magnet for middle-class black families like hers. Red brick homes with wooden porches sat on ample lots. Public schools were a few blocks away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she saw an ad in the Sunday paper offering a house on that very block, she bought it for $45,000; for the $9,000 down payment she used the savings her mother had left her when she died. She and her husband assumed the mortgage from the previous owner, with affordable payments of less than $400 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. West then had a job as a maintenance worker at an apartment complex for about $9 an hour. Her husband earned about $10 an hour as a truck driver. As the years passed, they added shrubbery to the front yard and photos of children's birthday parties to the walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought that was going to be my house,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She tapped her inheritance to buy another house on nearby Union Street, paying $15,000 in cash for a light-blue, vinyl-sided A-frame. She turned the house into a home for five homeless people. She did their laundry, reminded them to take their medications and cooked meals, while collecting payments of up to $750 a person each month from the agencies that placed them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, Ms. West and her husband spent more than they earned. They used credit cards to finance restaurant meals. They bought a new S.U.V.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the group home, Ms. West's compensation slipped as the state limited benefit payments. Yet every month brought the same thicket of bills -- water, electricity, gas, plus food for the people under her charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2001, Ms. West and her husband took out a $67,000 mortgage on the Union Street house -- which had increased considerably in value -- to refinance high-interest debts, assuming payments of nearly $700 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years later, her husband left her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It just took the life out me,'' she said. ''I was in a very bad state, a very depressed situation. Things just kind of went downhill. I just didn't care anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2005, she was broke. She sold the brick house to her cousin, disbanded the group home and moved in. She paid what bills she could through temporary jobs as a signature collector for petition drives. But as many months passed without work, the bills piled up past due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the next year, terse letters were coming from the mortgage company -- notices of delinquency, then threats of foreclosure. Much of the neighborhood was in a similar state. Broken windows sat unrepaired at a two-story apartment block across the street, where tattered curtains flapped in the breeze. The city boarded up abandoned homes to deter vagrants, drug addicts and prostitutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. West wrote to her mortgage company, seeking lower payments. But with tainted credit and no full-time job, she was not a candidate for a deal. Fliers beckoned with relief as companies offered to negotiate with her lender for lower payments. But when she called, the companies demanded upfront payments as high as $500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I told them, 'if I had that money, I wouldn't be going into foreclosure,' '' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the spring of 2008, Ms. West accepted an offer from the mortgage company: move out, hand over the keys and collect $2,500. She sold what furniture she could and put the rest on the street -- tables, beds, a couch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her uncle had said she could stay with him for a while. But when she called him to say she was on the way, he told her that his girlfriend was uncomfortable with the arrangement. Ms. West's daughter was in a cramped rented house with her boyfriend and her two children. Her son was in a rooming house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Ms. West, a stylish woman with a penchant for shiny lipstick and glittering jewelry, wound up camping in her car. She listened to the radio to drown out the voices of prostitutes trawling the street. She meditated. (''Just blank out everything in your mind,'' she said. ''Just go to a place that's peaceful, like a beach.'') She prayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was scary,'' she said. ''Here I am, alone, and I don't have nowhere to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next day, she moved in with a friend, remaining there for about three months. For several more months, she stayed with the cousin who had bought her old brick house and was living there with her husband and seven children. Toys lay scattered across the floor. The walls vibrated with music, television and the sounds of children. She lay awake on the couch, a vagabond in the one place that had once felt so solid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was losing my mind,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was grateful to be inside -- particularly during the Cleveland winter -- yet never comfortable or stable enough to plan beyond the next day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You know in the back of your mind that people don't really want you there,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, she lived out of her car, spending days at the public library, where she washed up in the restroom and used a computer to scan meager job listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, a woman she met on the street took her in and helped her formulate a recovery plan. She signed up for food stamps. She enrolled at a community college in a three-month, state-financed training program that would give her a certificate for an entry-level job in biotechnology, putting her in position to earn as much as $16 an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, she got a bed at the homeless shelter, reluctantly accepting that she needed her own space to re-establish her life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I never wanted to go to the shelter because of the stigma,'' she said. ''I'm a very independent person. I felt like I got myself into this situation, and I've got to get myself out. But I knew I couldn't just keep going back and forth and staying with these people and not moving forward with my life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She sleeps in a twin bed with a flower-print duvet, in a small room painted lavender. Her plants line the windowsill. She keeps to herself, reading motivational books, as she prepares to start classes next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is working again, taking care of senior citizens in their homes part time, and saving money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By December, she will exhaust the shelter's 90-day limit, so she is hurrying to line up a house to rent while arranging a subsidy through the West Side Catholic Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is still shaken by the past and anxious about the future, but she is again looking ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do want to eventually own a house again,'' she said. ''That's the American dream. That's what everybody wants.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOOK down: The names of New York neighborhoods are not carved into the sidewalk. As an area begins to gentrify, a new label often pops up to match the rising property values. A southern piece of Harlem was recently rebranded SoHa, and Park Slope, Brooklyn, keeps creeping south into territory once known as Sunset Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually, these nicknames are the invention of brokers trying to sell the area's new feel. But in Hudson Heights, which makes up the northwest corner of Washington Heights, a community group founded in 1993 to fight neighborhood decline claims the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Hudson Heights Owners Coalition, H.H.O.C., came up with it,'' said Simone Song, a principal broker at Simone Song Properties, ''though the real estate brokers got blamed for it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elizabeth Lorris Ritter, the owners group president, said, ''We didn't set out to change the name of the neighborhood, but we were careful in how we selected the name of the organization.'' To try to give their neighborhood a boost, members lobbied city officials, invested in area parks, and organized events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a phony name,'' countered Andrew S. Dolkart, the director of Columbia University's historic preservation program. ''It was Fort Washington -- that's the historic name of the neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever you want to call it, this microneighborhood has always had a look and feel that set it apart from the larger area in which it nestles. For one thing, there's the architecture. The area was developed in the 1920s and 1930s, later than the rest of Washington Heights, so it has a significant concentration of Art Deco buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cultural makeup of Hudson Heights sets it apart as well. The larger neighborhood has an enormous concentration of Dominicans, while Hudson Heights is more diverse. According to figures from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, just over half of the population of Washington Heights and Inwood is Dominican; 62.9 percent are Hispanic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hudson Heights had an influx of Dominicans, Mr. Dolkart said, ''but it didn't become as heavily Dominican as areas to the south and to the east.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to him, the 1980s brought another wave to the area: ''what I call refugees of the Upper West Side and Park Slope. Prices were relatively low compared to other areas in Manhattan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though real estate prices have gone way up in the last 20 years, a dollar still takes you much further in Hudson Heights than it does downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Benini and his wife, Ana Rodriguez, who rented in Hudson Heights for 10 years, bought a two-bedroom last winter. He declined to say how much they had paid; these days, two-bedrooms generally start at $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can actually get eight people at our dining room table,'' Mr. Benini said. ''That's not something you can normally do with a Manhattan apartment. And quite frankly, farther downtown, we would not have been able to afford it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This affordability pulls in a lot of young families with children -- the neighborhood is full of strollers and toddlers -- but it also attracts retirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Garcia and his wife, Clare, both grew up in Washington Heights. After spending more than 35 years in New Jersey raising a family and three years in a rental at Peter Cooper Village, they've just moved back, settling in a one-bedroom co-op on West 190th Street, which they bought for $425,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Garcia cited the affordability as a factor in their return, but another is the area's dynamism. It has always been a neighborhood of immigrants, he pointed out, so it's always changing. Mr. Garcia, who is of Puerto Rican descent, and Mrs. Garcia, who is of Irish origin, say they also appreciate the diversity. ''It's New York,'' was how she put it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geographically, Hudson Heights is set apart. The Hudson to the west is as clear a barrier as one could find, and Fort Tryon Park -- home to the Cloisters -- caps off the northern edge. The eastern boundary is more contentious, though most often it is said to be west of Broadway. And while many people consider the southern tip to be at the George Washington Bridge on 181st Street, others suggest that the neighborhood now stretches down to J. Hood Wright Park at 173rd Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area feels more residential than most of Manhattan. The only commercial stretches are on 187th Street, which has small shops, and 181st, which in addition to local stores has chains, like the <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> on Fort Washington Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not as relentlessly urban as other parts of Manhattan,'' said Alexis Higgins, who has lived in the area for five years. ''I would even say this neighborhood is like the semi-burbs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Higgins, along with her husband, Scott, and their 2-year-old son, lives in Castle Village on Cabrini Boulevard, a five-building complex overlooking the river. They have a two-bedroom one-bath co-op, which they bought in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in the 1930s for renters, the five X-shaped towers went co-op in 1986. Along with Hudson View Gardens, a 1920s Tudor co-op complex across the street, they are among the largest buildings around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Architecturally, they're great,'' Mr. Dolkart said. ''They're anchors of the neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Castle Village received a lot of attention in May 2005, when part of a 75-foot-high retaining wall below the complex collapsed onto the West Side Highway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Gerald Fingerhut, the president of the co-op board, repairs cost $26 million. The co-op is still involved in litigation -- with parties ranging from insurance brokers to engineers -- to recoup a portion of the costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Castle Village is also known for something else: children. When Ms. Higgins, who is pregnant with her second child, told her old obstetrician that she now lived in Castle Village, she said, ''Oh, you live in kid village.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complex has private gardens, but there are public parks throughout Hudson Heights. In addition to Fort Tryon and J. Hood Wright Parks, there is Bennett Park, on 185th Street between Fort Washington and Pinehurst Avenues. According to the Department of Parks and Recreation, its small patch of grass and playground is the highest point of land on the island of Manhattan, clocking in at 265.05 feet above sea level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are restaurants and bars, but not many. Neighborhood life revolves around the parks, but there are also community events open to the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Aside from the baby brigade, myself included,'' Ms. Higgins said, ''there are a ton of artists and creative people. It's not going to become a cultural wasteland with that kind of demographic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a monthly chamber music series called Concerts in the Heights, and classical music at Our Saviour's Atonement Lutheran Church. There is a film club and a speed-walking group, which marches through Fort Tryon Park three times a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an annual Harvest Festival in Bennett Park and, in the summer, an Uptown Arts Stroll, with visual and performing arts. Fort Tryon also hosts the city's annual Medieval Festival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the housing stock in Washington Heights is rental, and there are rentals available in Hudson Heights as well. A one-bedroom runs about $1,200 to $1,700 per month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But another factor that distinguishes Hudson from Washington Heights is the abundance of owner-occupied housing, most of it in co-ops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to brokers like Ms. Song of Simone Song Properties and Gus Perry of Stein-Perry Real Estate, one-bedrooms run from $260,000 to $400,000 and two-bedrooms from $400,000 to $650,000. Apartments in Castle Village, which has doormen, large gardens and sweeping views of the Hudson and the Palisades, can be a bit more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Like every other neighborhood in the city, we've been affected,'' Mr. Perry said of the last year's decline in real estate values. ''But we're probably less affected than other neighborhoods.'' He estimates that prices have come down 5 to 10 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the combined elementary and middle school known as No. 187 Hudson Cliffs, on Cabrini Boulevard, 70.7 percent of fourth graders met state standards in English and 88.2 percent in math. Of eighth graders, 72.6 percent satisfied requirements in English and 88.4 percent in math.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closest public high school is Gregorio Luperon Prep, on 165th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Its SAT averages last year were 340 in reading, 370 in math and 347 in writing, versus 435, 459 and 432 citywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The A train runs through Hudson Heights, traveling express from 125th to 59th Street, and reaching Midtown in about 25 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1930s brought in a flood of Central European Jews. One famous son is the statesman Henry Kissinger, whose family settled in Hudson Heights after fleeing Germany in 1938.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phones wouldn't stop ringing at the office of San Francisco's assessor-recorder. A besieged clerk repeated the same words over and over: ''It's too late to appeal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property tax bills arrived in San Francisco last week. Despite the recession and plummeting home prices, homeowners are learning that their property values are up, along with their taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call it the 2-percent solution. Assessors all over California have been addicted to it since 1978 when Proposition 13 capped assessment increases. The most any property value could rise, officially, was 2 percent a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, nearly every property assessment automatically goes up 2 percent annually, even if property values are down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when Jon Stuber opened a letter in July saying the value of his home had increased, his first reaction was, ''No, it didn't!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, Mr. Stuber left a rundown rental, took his life savings and bought a few-frills condo at 15th and Mission. It is rare to be a first-time homeowner in one of the world's most expensive cities. Mr. Stuber, originally from modest circumstances in rural Maine, lives a frugal, Hulu-instead-of-cable lifestyle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have been friends since he moved here a dozen years ago, and I watched him go from slinging hash in a restaurant to managing projects for a biotech firm. He has done hard labor for everything he owns. I was proud of him the day he closed on that condo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stuber bought it in 2007 for $610,000. No one thinks it is worth that much in 2009, but the city sent him an assessment of $634,642.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm going to fight,'' he vowed. ''I pretty much found out my property is about $100,000 less.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stuber is not alone. They are still processing the maelstrom of mail at City Hall, but this could be a record year of about 6,500 property assessment appeals, on par with the recession of 1993. Inspired by my friend's outrage, I studied my own assessment and also filed an appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners are armed with statistics from Web sites like Zillow.com that show home sale prices down an average of 21 percent in San Francisco from 2008 to 2009. They want more than just a waiver of the 2 percent. If they prevail, it will cost the county more, on some properties, than if there had been no increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We try to be fair,'' said Phil Ting, San Francisco's assessor-recorder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ting did decrease the assessments on about 5 percent of the properties in San Francisco -- 9,997 parcels. But, he said, ''everybody who didn't get a decrease went up 2 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all assessors take the same approach -- though, in fairness, property values elsewhere in the region have taken more of a hit than those in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, Santa Clara County's tax assessor, Larry Stone, reduced the assessments of nearly one in four homes. ''If I know someone is over-assessed, why would I look the other way?'' Mr. Stone said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reductions help those who get them, but an analysis of home sales data for the 2009 tax year shows a price drop in every single San Francisco neighborhood. This explains why people are livid. Up? Is this a joke?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is certainly not funny if you try to appeal. To a novice, the paperwork reads like Aramaic translated into gibberish. Then comes the wait. It is expected to take more than a year to process the appeals, and homeowners must pay the contested taxes up front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the frustration is that it is already too late to object in many counties. There were warnings, but the problem did not hit home for many people until tax bills arrived -- hence the avalanche of incredulous calls to City Hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longtime homeowners are protected from this mess, since Proposition 13 guarantees that their properties are assessed for less than what they are actually worth. But the value of homes bought in San Francisco since 2004, and as far back as 2000 in Santa Clara County, is probably down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those homeowners, how can assessors justify any rise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're not required to do a 2 percent bump, right?'' I asked Mr. Ting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He stared at me for an uncomfortable moment, like I was blaming him for the anger homeowners feel. Mr. Ting then explained how difficult it was to determine accurate values during this decline, but he said taxpayers might get relief -- next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's talk that there may be no 2 percent across the board,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No more 2 percent solution for anyone. What a concept.</p>

</div><div class="author">By COLIN MOYNIHAN   </div><div>677 words</div><div>16 October 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>The New York Times on the Web</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal prosecutors announced charges on Thursday against 41 lenders, lawyers and others in the real estate industry who they said used fraud to obtain more than $64 million in loans connected to more than 100 residential properties in New York State.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investigation involving the F.B.I., the Secret Service, the New York State Banking Department and other agencies led to the wire fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy charges against the lawyers, mortgage brokers and loan officers, who engaged in complex plots that operated over a period of years, said Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fraud schemes alleged in the cases unsealed today reflect a veritable smorgasbord of scams,'' Mr. Bharara said during a news conference in Lower Manhattan. ''Whether the economy was going up or the economy was going down, these alleged fraudsters were working feverishly to game the system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bharara said that the investigation, which he called Operation Bad Deeds, uncovered eight separate cases in which people were accused of obtaining loans through fraudulent means by falsifying mortgage applications, flipping properties and stripping equity from properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The targets of the fraud included desperate homeowners who were having difficulty making mortgage payments or facing foreclosure, Mr. Bharara said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, 32 people surrendered or were arrested in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina, prosecutors said. Four others had been charged previously, and five more were still at large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutors said that the largest scheme involved eight people connected to a mortgage brokerage firm in Queens called GuyAmerican. Among them were Peggy Persaud, a loan officer for the GuyAmerican Funding Corporation, which arranged loans from banks, and Ravi Persaud, a lawyer. The two Persauds -- between whom there is no known relationship -- and the others are accused of fraudulently obtaining $23 million in loans involving 44 properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The indictment said that the defendants in that case recruited straw purchasers to buy homes in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, sometimes looking for owners who were desperate to sell. They then resold those properties at inflated prices to other straw buyers, arranging for the new buyers to obtain loans using fraudulent information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Persaud received hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions based on the fraudulent loans, the indictment said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the second straw buyers obtained loans, some money was transferred to bank accounts controlled by two lawyers, Mr. Persaud and Cheddi Goberdhan, who were hired to represent the lenders, the indictment said. Later, those lawyers issued payments to the straw buyers and others involved, according to the indictment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After taking control of homes from the first straw buyers, the defendants sometimes continued to flip the properties to other straw buyers, obtaining additional fraudulent loans in the process, the indictment says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, prosecutors said, the defendants would strip all the equity from the homes, putting them through sham transactions and saddling the properties with enormous debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another case involving a Bronx real estate company called MTC, 10 people were accused of participating in a $5.6 million ''foreclosure rescue'' scheme in which they sought out troubled mortgage holders facing foreclosure, running radio ads in which they presented themselves as saviors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An indictment said that the defendants in that case, including the chief of MTC, Lavette M. Bills, duped troubled homeowners into selling their properties at low prices or persuaded them to transfer the deeds to their homes, promising to help solve their financial problems and then return the properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, prosecutors said, Ms. Bills and other defendants flipped those properties to straw buyers at inflated prices subsidized by unaffordable loans that the defendants persuaded lenders to issue based on false documentation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to a question from a reporter, Mr. Bharara said he could not confirm or deny whether investigators would look at the banks that issued loans based on false information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This office has a tradition of looking at institutions and executives of institutions,'' he said. ''And we will go wherever the facts lead.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Man Charged in Harlem Real Estate Fraud</span>
</div><div class="author">By JOHN ELIGON </div><div>951 words</div><div>15 October 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>30</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2007, Henry Vargas began shopping what he said was his 60 percent stake in a plum piece of Harlem real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wooed potential buyers with the name of his father, Victor -- a well-established Harlem landlord -- saying that his father owned a 30 percent stake in the commercial property, a triangular lot just north of Central Park, at Lenox and St. Nicholas Avenues. A third man with a stake in the lot, Manuel Duran Jr., was an elderly dirt farmer from the Dominican Republic whose share was only 10 percent, Mr. Vargas told potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vargas, 35, even posed in front of the property for a photograph that appeared in a real estate journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By May 2008, an independent developer agreed to buy Mr. Vargas's share for $4.8 million, giving him a $1 million down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five months later, New York Road Runners, the nonprofit organizer of the New York City Marathon, signed a contract to buy the same 60 percent share for $8.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property, it turned out, was not Mr. Vargas's to sell, prosecutors said on Wednesday. In fact, he owned no part of it, and Mr. Duran was the sole owner, Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, said at a news conference in his office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vargas, indicted on charges of forgery, grand larceny and scheming to defraud, was arraigned Wednesday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan in connection with his attempt to sell the property at 21-41 Lenox Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutors said that Mr. Vargas forged documents to make it seem as though he had a 60 percent ownership interest in the property. Before forging those documents, prosecutors said, Mr. Vargas had entered into an agreement with Mr. Duran to potentially buy the property for $36 million. That agreement gave Mr. Vargas access to information about the building, including the leases of the tenants, that he used to further present himself as the true owner, prosecutors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Mr. Vargas pleaded not guilty and remained in custody pending a bail application that his lawyer, Steven Ross, planned to submit. Mr. Ross declined to comment on the case because he said he had received it only shortly before the arraignment and had not had time to review all of the facts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vargas faces forgery and grand larceny charges that could land him in prison for up to six years if convicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutors said on Wednesday that Mr. Vargas had a history of forgery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2000 and 2003, Mr. Vargas, who lives in Whitestone, Queens, pleaded guilty to separate forgery charges and served a year in a federal prison, prosecutors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current case, the developer, Pete Skyllas, never went through with the purchase. But believing that Mr. Vargas was the majority owner of the property, Mr. Skyllas let him keep the $1 million down payment as a loan and agreed to share in any profits that Mr. Vargas would make from a sale, prosecutors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Road Runners never paid Mr. Vargas any money, prosecutors said, but put $1 million into an escrow account. The group also spent about $300,000 in fees for lawyers and other consultants related to the transaction, prosecutors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutors said that Fernando Mateo, the head of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, was a collateral victim of Mr. Vargas's scheme. Mr. Mateo had lent Mr. Skyllas $3.8 million for a different real estate venture, with Mr. Skyllas's supposed stake in the Lenox Avenue property as collateral, prosecutors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Vargas's scheme fell apart after the Road Runners told one of the building's tenants about the transfer, and that tenant notified Mr. Duran, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said that Mr. Vargas was trying to get as much money as possible up front from the Road Runners, and said he might have been planning to flee to the Dominican Republic, where his father is from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If he would have been willing to wait and take over his father's business, he could have done well,'' Mr. Morgenthau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A profile of Mr. Vargas that appeared in the New York Real Estate Journal in June 2008 called him an ''innovative businessman'' who was instrumental in revitalizing Harlem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''His work in the community will forever be the subject of conversation for many years to come in Harlem,'' the article said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victor Vargas has made a living as a landlord of apartment buildings on West 111th Street for 30 years, said his daughter, Emily Ospino, 39.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2008, Henry Vargas took out an $8.5 million mortgage on the buildings without telling his father, according to Carl E. Person, a lawyer for Victor Vargas. Henry Vargas pocketed about $1.1 million and allowed the mortgage to go into default, Mr. Person said. The elder Mr. Vargas was unaware of his son's actions until receiving a foreclosure notice, Mr. Person said, adding that the action has forced Victor Vargas to file for bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I felt a range of emotions -- shocked, upset, betrayed, victimized,'' Victor Vargas, who speaks little English, said through Ms. Ospino. ''I couldn't believe my son would do this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victor Vargas said he believed that his son manipulated his mother into siding with him, causing a rift that led to their separation three years ago. They had been married for 40 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has torn our family completely apart,'' Ms. Ospino said. ''It's just a mess.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is closing in on a milestone: building or preserving 165,000 city-financed apartments and houses for low-, moderate- and middle-income families, the goal of a $7.5 billion housing plan he announced in 2002 and expanded in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has already financed the creation or preservation of 94,000 units, including 72,000 for low-income households, city officials say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those efforts have been overwhelmed by a far larger number -- the 200,000 apartments affordable to low-income renters that New York City has lost over all, because of market forces, during the mayor's tenure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shrinking supply of these apartments, highlighted by researchers at New York University, illustrates not only the increasing strain that housing costs have had on this city of renters, but also the limits of the mayor's success in providing the city's poor with reasonable places to live. While the mayor's plan has put thousands of low-income families in new or rehabilitated buildings and helped stabilize neighborhoods, it has been nearly drowned out by the twin waves of gentrification and rent deregulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're losing units even with additions to the stock under the mayor's housing plan,'' said Victor Bach, a senior housing policy analyst for the Community Service Society, a nonprofit antipoverty group, and a member of a panel that advised the Bloomberg administration on housing in 2002. ''I'm not knocking the plan. I'm just saying it hasn't done much to stop the hemorrhaging of lower-rent units across the city.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Including public housing, the number of apartments considered affordable to low-income households -- those earning less than 80 percent of the city's median income, or less than $37,000 -- decreased to 991,592 from 1,189,962, a drop of nearly 17 percent, from 2002 to 2008. About 42 percent of the city's households fit in that income category in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data were supplied by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University, which analyzed the city's Housing and Vacancy Survey from 2002, 2005 and 2008. The center and other housing experts consider an apartment affordable if it costs no more than 30 percent of a family's income, or about $925 a month for a family earning $37,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the numbers present a gloomy picture, they did contain a glimmer of hope. The worst years were between 2002 and 2005, when the city lost affordable apartments at the highest rate of the mayor's tenure. In the next three years, as the mayor's plan took hold, the city actually gained about 8,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're very proud of what we've accomplished, but we're also not satisfied or done,'' said Rafael Cestero, the city's housing commissioner. ''We can't undo what happened between 2002 and 2005, but what happened during those years is exactly why we created the largest municipal housing plan in the nation's history. What the data suggests is that the response is working.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A majority of the 200,000 units in the Furman Center data -- 137,000 apartments -- had been part of the rent regulation system but were deregulated. In most cases, they became market-rate once their rent topped $2,000 and they became vacant, as allowed by the rent regulation system. Thousands of others had been in the state Mitchell-Lama or federal Section 8 programs, but were taken out of those subsidy programs by their owners and converted to market-rate apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The affordability of all of the city's 2.1 million rental apartments is of course beyond the control of Mr. Bloomberg and the city's housing agency, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing experts and tenant advocates say that the mayor has been far from powerless, and that his housing policy has suffered from a kind of tunnel vision, by focusing energy and resources on his 165,000-unit target rather than the larger pool of existing housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenant advocates have been pushing state legislators to make it harder to remove apartments from rent regulation, a move strongly opposed by landlords and the real estate industry. The mayor has been virtually silent on the issue, though he appoints the members of the Rent Guidelines Board, which decides the annual rent increases for rent-stabilized apartments. He proposed state legislation in 2003 that would prevent the loss of Mitchell-Lama units, but the measure failed and has become a low priority for the mayor, tenant advocates say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There needs to be a focus on preservation at the same level of intensity that there is for new development,'' said Michelle de la Uz, executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee, a nonprofit Brooklyn-based affordable housing and community development group. ''It's not as though things aren't moving in the right direction. It's that advocates have a different sense of urgency.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bloomberg's campaign said that the mayor intends to expand the housing plan by investing an additional $965 million, which will help preserve 10,000 more units of Mitchell-Lama housing than originally planned and stabilize apartment buildings that are overleveraged, meaning their debt is unsupportable by the income generated by rents, a widespread problem that has led to the physical and financial deterioration of many buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Housing and Vacancy Survey showed that in 2008, 29.4 percent of all renter households in the city paid more than 50 percent of their income toward rent, an increase from 25.5 percent in 2002. Experts call those families ''severely rent burdened.'' (The city's median income in the Furman survey differed slightly from that in other recent surveys.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial squeeze has a spillover effect. It leads to overcrowded conditions and illegally partitioned rooms. It contributes to the record number of homeless families in city shelters. It fills the halls of the city's housing courts and fuels residential evictions, which have risen slightly to 25,027 in 2008, from 23,669 in 2006. And it causes many people to move out of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study prepared for the Bloomberg administration by the polling firm Harris Interactive found that 64 percent who moved out of the city cited housing costs as a major reason. The 2006 study was obtained by the Center for an Urban Future, a nonprofit research group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the recession, James Hadden was earning up to $1,000 a week cutting hair at a Harlem salon, but more recently he has taken home $400 to $700. So he has fallen behind on the $1,300-a-month rent on his one-bedroom apartment, a fourth-floor walk-up on Lenox Avenue. His landlord began asking him to pay weekly. ''I'm going to go pay this man's rent so he'll stop calling me,'' Mr. Hadden, 42, said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he was happy to be only 16 blocks from work; closer to the salon, on Fifth Avenue at 116th Street, rents are even more expensive. But he said he sometimes heard gunfire outside his building on Saturdays. ''My family comes to visit me and I'm embarrassed to show them where I live,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the net losses of affordable apartments, experts in the field are quick to praise Mr. Bloomberg on much of his housing record. The mayor's plan has suffered only one major setback since it was unveiled in December 2002: Mr. Bloomberg's goal of creating or preserving 165,000 units by 2013 was pushed back one year in late 2008 because of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cestero, the housing commissioner, said the plan was on schedule and no further delays were expected. He said the preservation of existing affordable housing was the agency's ''No. 1 priority,'' and he said the agency would ''engage in the discussion'' about rent regulation at the right time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan relies on the rezoning of underused manufacturing areas, including the Greenpoint and Williamsburg neighborhoods in Brooklyn, that allowed developers to build larger buildings if they set aside some apartments as low-cost units. New units have also been created through the city's Housing Development Corporation, which issues bonds and uses its corporate reserves to finance low-cost mortgages to affordable housing developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the city has done an extraordinary job, more than any other place in America,'' said Jerilyn Perine, executive director of the nonprofit Citizens Housing and Planning Council and the former city housing commissioner who helped create the mayor's original plan in 2002. ''You have to go to Europe to find another city that has this kind of robust, sustained housing policy and housing investment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 94,000 units the administration counts as gains, fewer than half, about 35,000, are new. The rest are apartments that City Hall says it has preserved as affordable, by providing low-interest loans to rehabilitate them or keep them from leaving rent-subsidy programs..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some housing experts say the loss of affordable units is evidence of the city's economic vitality and a natural consequence of demand for affordable housing exceeding supply. As Ms. Perine wrote in the housing plan, there has never been a time in the city's history when all of its population's housing needs have been met with safe and affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think there's a serious crisis in this area,'' said Magda L. Cruz, a lawyer and an owner representative on the Rent Guidelines Board. ''I do believe a big problem is employment, and salaries just not being high enough to sustain cost-of-living increases. That's something the mayor plays a part in, but it doesn't have to do with building new housing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordable housing is in such demand that most new apartments are awarded by lottery. Alan Ceballos, 30, said he was grateful to have won his two-bedroom apartment, costing $839 a month, in a new building on University Avenue in the Bronx.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ceballos, who earns about $33,000 a year as a sales associate at a car rental agency, won the spot three years ago, allowing him to move out of a one-bedroom that cost $794. He and his wife had two children then, and now have three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that traffic often speeds down the street and that people who hang out in a park by the building sometimes smash car windows; his own windshield has been broken. But he is happy with the building itself: its cleanliness, security, price and size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Before, it being a one-bedroom, it did not have enough closet space,'' said Mr. Ceballos. Besides the extra room he now has, ''the kitchen is bigger, the living room is bigger, so it's adequate space now.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN DIEGO -- THERE are many things that can strike fear in a grown man's heart -- strange, unexplained noises in the night, the feeling that someone is whispering in your ear when no one is about -- things that did seem to happen in the suburban home of the first-time director Oren Peli and that inspired his very low-budget movie ''Paranormal Activity,'' which totters this very moment on the precipice of pop-cult sensation. But the one that seems to make Mr. Peli most uncomfortable is the suggestion that he and the girlfriend with whom he lived when those strange goings-on took place should do an interview together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been broken up for two years,'' Mr. Peli says. ''It would be kind of weird.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahhh, the complexities that ensue when art follows the paranormal and so much hangs on the marketing. Let us pause for a moment and invoke the sacred words ''The Blair Witch Project'' -- although with ''Paranormal Activity'' No. 5 at the box office last weekend, the incantation may no longer be necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The film deals with a young couple who move into a new home and encounter Strange Goings-On. Katie, who enjoys beading, is open to the idea of spirits; Micah, a day trader, is a skeptic who sets up a video camera in the bedroom to find out what is really happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Peli, a 39-year-old former day trader and Web designer, thought about setting up a video camera in the bedroom of his home here, after moving in several years ago, when he and his then-girlfriend, Toni Taylor, who enjoyed making beaded jewelry, were troubled by strange sounds. But it seemed like a better idea to make a movie about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He shot the film in his home in seven days, for a cost he estimates at $10,000, not including the requisite home improvement, which we shall deal with later. The two unknowns who played Katie and Micah, Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat (apparently the film was so low-budget they could not even afford new names), were each paid $500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a review last weekend, the New York Times film critic A. O. Scott called the movie a ''crudely made, half-clever little frightener'' with ''a measure of ingenuity.'' But the most withering criticism, to anyone with a shred of decorative self-respect, was Mr. Scott's opinion that the house was ''nondescript.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, its white stucco exterior has a certain Southern California charm, although it is identical to those of the other houses in the development. Inside, it is instantly evident that this is the home of a bachelor indie filmmaker: There's a six-foot cardboard advertisement for ''Paranormal Activity'' to the left as you walk in; three computers and packages of Oreos and pretzels on the breakfast counter; and a den with a 73-inch Mitsubishi TV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Peli, barefoot, in jeans and a shirt that might trace its paternity to soccer, is a low-key, friendly host, apologizing for constantly checking his messages and taking calls throughout the interview -- he is in preproduction for another film, he explains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He makes coffee, shares Oreos and runs through his bio, which includes growing up in Israel, where he was a computer geek who dropped out of high school at 16. At 17, he created a computer program with a friend, which brought in $120,000 and allowed them to go to the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He lived first in Los Angeles, then moved to San Diego, where he worked in Web design. In 1999, when he was 29, he met Ms. Taylor, then 25, who set up phone systems for businesses. Neither believed in ghosts or an afterlife, though Ms. Taylor, like the woman in the movie, was more spiritually inclined. By January 2003, they were a serious couple looking for a place to raise a family, and they moved into this four-bedroom house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What did it cost?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Half a mil,'' the former day trader says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The noises started the first night he and Ms. Taylor were in the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Toni grabs me and says, 'There's someone in the house,' '' Mr. Peli says. ''It ended up being the ice maker.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then things that were not as easily explained started happening. A large plastic container of detergent that weighed at least five pounds, and had been on a deep shelf, was found the next morning across the room. The couple began to feel vibrations in bed, and yet when they checked the United States Geological Survey site for earthquakes, there hadn't been any. Oddest of all was Ms. Taylor's persistent feeling that someone was whispering in her ear. Mr. Peli, who never heard any whispering, considered wiring the house to find the source, but decided against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he began writing a treatment for the film, bought a $3,000 <span class="companylink">Sony</span> Fx1 camera and a computer for editing and, like any director, started framing the shots. Most of the action takes place in the bedroom, where the couple slept on a mattress on the floor. It was immediately apparent to Mr. Peli that this would be neither cool nor appealing in a film. He searched for an appropriate bed, finally settling on a carved wood piece, for either $1,400 or $1,600. He also realized that the wall-to-wall carpeting throughout the house would have to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It made the house look really bad -- like an apartment, not like a house, '' he says. He paused, concerned about giving away too much of the plot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generalize, he is directed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hardwood floors are easier to slide things or people on,'' he says. ''And there are sounds. Footsteps on hardwood definitely sound more menacing than on carpet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hardwood floors cost between $25,000 and $30,000, Mr. Peli says; he also spent $7,000 to replace the wall along the stairs with a banister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Peli and Ms. Taylor broke up in 2007, soon after the film, in which Ms. Taylor is credited as a producer, made its debut at the Screamfest Festival in Los Angeles. They remain friends, and Ms. Taylor has attended several screenings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she moved out, the strange sounds stopped, Mr. Peli says, but says Ms. Taylor still hears them. And so, after seeing Mr. Peli, it was time to talk to Ms. Taylor, who lives a half-hour away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Taylor, who is blond with an air of soft and wounded vulnerability, is renting the back half of a modern home in a wooded grove. The one-bedroom apartment, with a vaulted ceiling and a large, elaborate tub that juts into a garden, has a dreamier and far more interesting vibe than Mr. Peli's house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It once belonged to a film producer and his girlfriend, a Las Vegas showgirl, Ms. Taylor says. She also says she believes her landlady's mother died there; her landlady insisted on having a psychic do a cleansing ceremony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Taylor herself seems psychically jumpy. When a soap dish falls from the bathroom wall shortly after a reporter arrives, she finds it significant. That's weird, she says. Why would that happen now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been a major loss in her life recently -- a very close friend named Brian died in May after minor surgery. While Mr. Peli is the new talent everyone wants to meet, Ms. Taylor is in a place of mourning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their breakup seems to be a tender subject, but Ms. Taylor speaks fondly of their first date, in a more carefree time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He rolled up in a little red Miata, wearing a leather jacket. He tells me, 'The only thing I worry about is am I going to drive with the top down or am I going to the Jacuzzi?' '' she says. ''I worry about everything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is she still in love with him?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who wouldn't love Oren, Ms. Taylor says. He is so decent and smart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to the subjects at hand, ghosts and spirits. Ms. Taylor confirms that she does not believe in them, but she didfeel as if someone was whispering into her ear when she moved into the house in which ''Paranormal Activity'' was filmed. It wasn't as it was in the film, where the woman's hair blows across her face whenever a spirit is near, but Ms. Taylor says that she could certainly feel something on her face. And in her new place, she says, there have been many more strange occurrences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her friend Brian would sometimes spend the night, she says, and on the four-month anniversary of his death, she came home to find the sheets on his side of the bed pulled down. Also, towels had been rumpled, and she never leaves towels rumpled. And a gift from Brian, a Smashing Pumpkins CD box that she had placed in a drawer, had been moved to a shelf beside a card he had given her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On another occasion, she had seen the hem of the curtain on the garden door suspended in the air as if someone were holding it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could have been air from the bottom of the window, no?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No way,'' Ms. Taylor says. ''Wind is fluffy. This just kept it up there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The talk turns to friends and loss. Grief can confuse the mind, the reporter suggests. You can forget something as simple as the person you were standing next to at a funeral. Isn't it possible that one might have, uncharacteristically, mussed some towels and forgotten to straighten them, or removed a gift from a drawer and put it on a shelf?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a nice explanation,'' Ms. Taylor says. ''But that box was definitely in a drawer, no place else. And when I came home, it was out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is more talk of the death of friends, of the pain of never having had the chance to say goodbye. Then the reporter, finally out of words, departs, leaving Ms. Taylor with the saddest of specters, the ghost of a friend that never goes away.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO -- The financial district of this city, the fifth-largest metropolitan area in North America, with a population of 5.4 million, is the scene of an exceptional flurry of development, especially in light of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three green towers with a combined 3.1 million square feet of office space are opening before the end of the year in the downtown financial district. In addition, within a 20-minute walk, three high-rise condominium-hotel towers costing about 1.23 billion Canadian dollars (about $1.19 billion) will open next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This unusual burst of construction has rejuvenated the lower edge of the Bay Street financial district. The district has also projected to the south into a vacant 30-acre site across Front Street toward the Lake Ontario waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the worldwide economic downturn, ''Toronto's real estate investment fundamentals and its place as Canada's financial capital are more sound than most international capitals -- New York included,'' said Blake Hutcheson, a partner and head of global real estate investing at Mount Hallet Capital, a New York-based private equity fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the torrent of development in Toronto's financial district was the culmination of a process that had taken 20 years ''from concept to completion.'' The three new downtown office towers were started before the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their developers have preleased more than two-thirds of the space, taking advantage of pent-up demand for modern office space. No significant office towers had been built in the financial district for 17 years, according to the city's planning department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first of the financial district towers to be completed was the 51-story 1.2-million-square-foot Bay Adelaide Centre West, developed by a partnership of the <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties Corporation</span>, based in New York, and <span class="companylink">BPO Properties Ltd</span>., based in Toronto. It opened this month and has been 73 percent preleased to the accounting giant KPMG and other tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The name of the tower includes the word ''West'' because two more phases, encompassing another 2.6 million square feet of space, are planned. Construction of this first tower, which cost 308 million Canadian dollars, actually began almost two decades ago but was aborted after the foundation was completed in 1991, during an earlier recession, when Toronto's office vacancy rates hit 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Farley, president and chief executive for Brookfield's Canadian commercial operations, says the new building is the first high-rise office building in downtown Toronto to be awarded a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design gold rating. He said that the building would have ''an estimated 40 percent energy savings relative to other buildings built to the Canadian Model National Energy Code,'' another voluntary standard that gives builders green bragging rights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another new building, the RBC Centre, a 43-story tower with a 10-story podium and three underground parking levels, is the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span>'s new head office. It was developed at a cost of about 420 million Canadian dollars by the <span class="companylink">Cadillac Fairview Corporation</span> of Toronto on behalf of its parent, the <span class="companylink">Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan</span>. The new tower, which is to open later this month, is at the edge of the financial district, in a thriving entertainment district that includes a circular concert hall, an opulent 1900s-era theater, and other entertainment venues, restaurants, bars and recycled period buildings turned into offices, studios and loft condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final new building, the 30-story Telus Tower, which is costing about 250 million Canadian dollars, is on a corner of the windswept 30-acre former railway lands, which have been abandoned for about three decades. It is to be completed next month. The site is near Union Station, the country's busiest passenger transportation hub, used by about 250,000 passengers each work day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Menkes, the president of Menkes Developments of Toronto, the developer of the tower, says the building is 82 percent leased by Telus Business Solutions of Vancouver, which provides communications services across Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Hospitals of Ontario Pension Plan</span> of Toronto and Halcyon Real Estate Partners Fund, a New York-based institutional real estate equity fund, are joint venture partners with Menkes. ''Nearly filling the building space in a difficult leasing environment was an accomplishment,'' Mr. Menkes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new buildings will all provide access to the 16.8-mile underground PATH system, a climate-controlled retail, service and food walkway winding under most of the office towers downtown, with access to the subway. The office buildings will also be connected by the PATH to Union Station, which itself will be redeveloped in 2010 at a cost of 640 million Canadian dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three luxury hotel-condominiums that are under construction are in the downtown Bay Street financial district or within a few blocks of it. They are the 70-story Trump International Hotel and Tower, which is to cost 500 million Canadian dollars; the 53-story <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> and Residences at the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span>, with a price tag of 300 million Canadian dollars; and the 65-story Living Shangri-La Toronto, projected at 430 million Canadian dollars. They are expected to open next year or early in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these properties are expected to be attractive to executives doing business in the financial district, and they will have conference facilities. The upper stories will be used for residential condominiums, a booming sector in Toronto. Another building just starting to go up in the area is 18 York Street, a 26-story tower across the street from Telus Towers. It is expected to open in the fall of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GWL Realty Advisers of Toronto is developing the tower for the <span class="companylink">British Columbia Investment Management Corporation</span> of Vancouver. <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> is expected to be the principal tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kaid Al-Ani, an associate partner of the Mitchell Partnership of Toronto, which is designing its mechanical systems, says 18 York Street will be noteworthy for its cooling system, which will circulate cold water drawn from Lake Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Webber, a planner who leads the green practice for Toronto-based Halsall Associates Ltd., an engineering consulting firm responsible for green and sustainability features at 18 York Street, says all of these new buildings ''meet several city of Toronto planning objectives, including expansion of the downtown business district, employment growth, transit-oriented development and revitalization of the area surrounding Union Station.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it seems surprising to have all this activity during a recession, there was an acute need for new construction in the financial district, according to John O'Bryan, a vice chairman of <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Ltd</span>., a commercial real estate services company, in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until this year, the newest buildings there were almost 20 years old, and a number of major tenants had been pushing for more modern buildings with larger and more efficient floor plates and green qualities, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of them also preferred to be downtown because financial employees are seen as increasingly eager to live in condos downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Bryan noted that most of the tenants in the first two buildings came out of existing downtown buildings, leaving huge blocks of space to refill. ''The older buildings that tenants left had never been retrofitted, and yet were always full,'' Mr. O'Bryan said. ''Owners will now retrofit those old buildings and fill them up over time.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE sudden rise in home prices suggests that the psychology of the market has shifted substantially. But what should we expect in the months ahead? Not necessarily that we're entering a new housing boom. To a large extent, where we're heading depends on what home buyers are thinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some clues are found in the annual home-buyer surveys that Karl Case, the Wellesley economics professor, and I have run for years. For the surveys, we canvas recent home buyers in four cities -- Los Angeles, San Francisco, Milwaukee and Boston; the surveys are now being conducted under the auspices of the Yale School of Management. We have just received the 2009 results, with responses from June and July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's survey coincides nicely with the upturn in home prices, the sharpest change in direction we have ever seen. The data show that the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 10-City Composite Home Price Index for the United States rose 3.6 percent between April and July. While that is not a whopping increase, it followed a decline of 4.8 percent in the previous period, between January and April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suddenness of this shift surprised me. In my column in June, I wrote that home prices might well continue to decline for years. As of that time, the S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller price index had fallen every month for almost three years. Add to that the prospect of continuing high unemployment and a weak economy for years to come, and the prospects for home prices did not seem rosy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new data are startling. Since the indexes began in 1987, the closest parallel to such a change came at the conclusion of the last housing bust, at the end of the 1990-91 recession. Home prices rose 2.3 percent from April to July 1991 after having fallen 2.1 percent from January to April that year. By July 1996, five years after that ''turnaround,'' home prices were down 0.6 percent from their July 1991 level, and down 13.8 percent in inflation-adjusted terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could the more extreme recent shift mean that home prices will just keep rising this time? Here is where our new survey results are helpful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We looked at both the long- and short-term attitudes of home buyers. In our survey, we ask, ''On average over the next 10 years, how much do you expect the value of your property to change each year?'' The average answer among 311 respondents in 2009 was an increase of 11.2 percent. The median response -- with half above, half below -- was 5 percent, also high. That sounds rather like bubble thinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a home buyer who borrows 90 percent of the money to acquire a house, an appreciation rate of 11.2 percent offers an investment bonanza. By putting a small amount of money down, investors stand to make a large gain if home prices climb. That is the power of leveraging. Recently, however, home buyers have also experienced the unpleasant consequences of leverage when home prices fall. Investing in a home during the wild past few years has been like gambling in a casino: You can leave with riches or empty pockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In our survey data from one year earlier, when prices were falling at an annual rate of nearly 20 percent, buyers were still expressing long-term optimism. Then, the average answer to the question about expected yearly increases in home values was 9.5 percent a year, with a median of 5 percent -- high figures indeed for that time. The bubble thinking is not new.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those long-term expectations may not have changed much in character, but short-term expectations certainly have. In the survey, we also ask, ''How much of a change do you expect there to be in the value of your home over the next 12 months?'' Here, the average answer for June-July 2009 was a 2.3 percent rise, versus a negative 0.4 percent a year earlier. That was a dramatic change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another survey question is this: ''If you think that present trends will not continue forever, what do you think will stop them?'' Respondents were asked to answer in their own words. In 2008, when the current trend was unambiguously down, people nonetheless made it clear that they thought a housing recovery would come as the recession ended, with a new president after the election, and after home prices have come back down. What has changed in 2009 is that they suddenly see this anticipated scenario as actually playing out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An additional question pertains to short-run considerations of market timing. We have been asking respondents whether they agree with this statement: ''I bought now because I felt that I had to even though I might have done better financially if I had waited.'' During the housing boom in 2004, only 17.9 percent agreed with that statement. That figure doubled, to 36.7 percent, when prices were dropping fast in 2008, and now has come back to 24.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT should we conclude? Given the abnormality of the economic environment, the sudden turn in the housing market probably reflects a new home-buyer emphasis on market timing. For years, people have been bulls for the long term. The change has been in their short-term thinking. The latest answers suggest that people think the price slide is over, so there is no longer such a good reason to wait to buy. And so they cause an upward blip in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, it appears that the extreme ups and downs of the housing market have turned many Americans into housing speculators. Many people are still playing a leverage game, watching various economic indicators as well as the state of federal bailout programs -- including the $8,000 first-time home-buyer tax credit that is currently scheduled to expire before Dec. 1 -- in an effort to time their home-buying decisions. The sudden turn could signal a new housing boom, but is more likely just a sign of a period of higher short-run price volatility.</p>
