<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private employers maintained a steady pace of hiring in August, and the number of contracts to buy previously owned homes surged in July, suggesting that the economy was regaining enough momentum for the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to raise interest rates this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data released on Wednesday showed a weakening of factory activity in the Midwest, indicating that the manufacturing sector continued to be hobbled by the residual effects of a strong dollar and a slump in oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This should give the Fed confidence that the economy is strong enough to generate new employment and, importantly, that the economy has enough forward momentum to withstand an interest rate hike,'' said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ADP National Employment Report showed that private nonfarm payrolls increased by 177,000 jobs this month after rising by 194,000 in July. August's gain was in line with economists' expectations. The services sector accounted for all the increase, with construction shedding 2,000 jobs on top of the 5,000 lost in July. Manufacturing payrolls were flat after rising by 5,000 jobs in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">ADP</span> report, which is jointly created with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report for August, which is due on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of last year, the United States' central bank raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade and has held them steady since. But with a range of data suggesting the economy has regained speed after sputtering in the first half of the year, most economists expect another rate increase in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Atlanta Fed</span> is forecasting third-quarter gross domestic product rising at a 3.5 percent annual rate. That upbeat assessment of the economy was further bolstered by a second report on Wednesday showing that contracts to buy previously owned homes surged in July after two straight months of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said its Pending Home Sales index, based on contracts signed last month, increased 1.3 percent to its second-highest reading in over a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The latest rise suggests some improvement in existing-home sales,'' said Kevin Cummins, senior economist at RBS in Stamford, Conn. ''However, we may not see all of the latest reported increase filter through as quickly as it usually does'' because of delays in the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for housing is being driven by the labor market, which is steadily generating increases in wages as it nears full employment. But sales are being constrained by tight inventories and high prices, which are causing appraisal complications and delaying the closing of contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the manufacturing sector is not keeping up with gains in the overall economy as factories continue to process the lingering effects of the dollar's rally and the oil price collapse. In addition, the sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been hamstrung by weak global demand and an inventory correction in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a third report, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its business barometer fell 4.3 points to 51.5 in August. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in factory activity in the automotive-heavy region.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDThe Hamptons' star-studded cachet has long tilted east of the Shinnecock Canal to the highly prized -- and high-priced -- areas of Southampton Village, Bridgehampton and East Hampton Town. Expansive oceanfront estates, fashionable shops and chic restaurants add to their aura as premier seaside resorts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when it came to buying a summer house, Will and Lynn Bagliebter of Scarsdale, N.Y., stopped short of the canal. They had no interest in going east.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Having been to the Hamptons many times over the years, and suffered through traffic east of Southampton, we were determined to find something, initially to rent and then to buy, that was west of these traffic issues,'' said Mr. Bagliebter, 65, a lawyer, adding that being ''down to earth,'' he and his wife had ''no use'' for a social scene. ''Getting stuck in traffic in our minds would be a major drawback and irritation to buying in the Hamptons.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traffic worsens east of the canal because the divided highway ends and the road narrows. So for those who believe that an easier trip to the beach as well as comparatively lower housing prices are more important than a fancy ZIP code or celebrity sightings, west of the canal is an increasingly sought-after option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is no longer a stepchild,'' said Todd Bourgard, an associate broker with <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>. West of the canal includes Hampton Bays, which straddles the canal; Quogue; Westhampton Beach; and Remsenburg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the Bagliebters paid $915,000 for a shingled 2,400-square-foot Cape Cod-style house with an in-ground pool on an acre in Westhampton Beach. This summer, even before a planned $500,000 renovation, the house was catnip for their children and grandchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Westhampton Beach offers us everything we could possibly want in a vacation home. Frankly, we are not sure what the east offers that the west doesn't,'' Mr. Bagliebter said. ''The beaches here are as nice as the beaches on the other side of the canal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mornings, the couple stroll into town for breakfast at the Beach Bakery Grand Cafe; evenings ''the kids walk into town to get ice cream,'' added Ms. Bagliebter, 61, a banker. The couple also can walk to the movies and the Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center. He plays golf; she attends services at the Hampton Synagogue in Westhampton Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel, said that rising automobile traffic to the east ''is perhaps a factor for the greater growth in sales west of the canal over the past five years.'' The 21.9 percent surge in sales volume west of the canal compared with five years ago, he said, ''represents the shift in demand to west of the canal from buyers being priced out of the east-of-the-canal area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the second quarter of this year, the average price of homes west of the canal was $1,005,758, slightly less than half of the average $2,015,387 east of the canal, where eight-figure price tags are commonplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past five years, sales prices in the Hamptons west of the canal experienced more growth, with a 15 percent uptick, while east-of-the-canal prices dipped 4.8 percent, Mr. Miller said. West of the canal, prices in the second quarter of this year were up 8.8 percent over the same period last year; on the east side the increase was 2.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing stock west of the canal is more ''skewed toward lower-priced homes'' than it is to the east, Mr. Miller said. According to the Hamptons market report he prepares for <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>, 53.1 percent of all sales in the second quarter were for less than $1 million, which is ''inconsistent with the general perception of the Hamptons housing market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents say the way of life in the western beach towns also is more low key than that to the east.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the sun set on a recent Wednesday, Pamela Glazer, 62, a local architect, ordered clams at the Beach Hut, a packed waterside concession at Meschutt Beach County Park in Hampton Bays. An enthusiastic crowd was dancing to Mambo Loco, a local band. Children played in the sand, and paddle boarders plied the Great Peconic Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Life out here is about being on the water,'' Ms. Glazer said. ''If you are coming out for the scenery, there is no reason to go further east.'' But she noted that those seeking ''a certain prestige'' and the ''lifestyles of the rich and famous,'' are ''not going to be happy'' in the western Hamptons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing up, Oliver Freundlich, 43, an architect who now lives in Brooklyn, spent weekends and holidays at his parents' Bridgehampton spread up tony Jobs Lane from Mecox Beach. But when he looked for a summer place with his wife, Britta von Schoeler, 41, and their daughter, Wilhelmina, 7, buying east of the canal ''was absolutely out of the question financially.'' Nor, with busy work schedules, did they ''want to run the risk of tearing our hair out on three-hour drives back and forth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. von Schoeler's family rented a place in closer-in Hampton Bays, which opened his eyes to ''traditionally more blue-collar neighborhoods'' with smaller lots, he said, ''but, most important, still in joyful proximity to some of the greatest beaches on the East Coast.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the couple paid $700,000 for a white-shuttered shingled house with five bedrooms and two and a half baths on 0.66 acre in Westhampton. It included a resident pass to Rogers Beach. ''The combination of being 68 miles from the city and eight minutes from the beach hit our sweet spot,'' Mr. Freundlich said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With waterfront restaurants like CowFish and Rumba that you can pull a boat up to, Hamptons Bay is hopping, Mr. Bourgard of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> said. Sales in Hampton Bays, which he called the Hamptons' ''most reasonably priced area'' are up 25 percent from last year, and ''last year was a booming year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among Hampton Bays listings, he said, are five bayfront homes for under $1 million, 10 between $1 million and $2 million, and eight from $2 million to $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, one of Mr. Bourgard's listings, a nine-acre shorefront property for $4,995,000 in Hampton Bays, went into contract with a client who had been renting a house in Bridgehampton. ''Now they are seeing the value,'' he said. ''It takes as long to get from Manhattan to Hampton Bays as it does from Hampton Bays to East Hampton.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharon and Joop de Korte came to Hampton Bays because they wanted to change their lives as well as start a new business together -- she was in market research and he was a sound engineer for rock 'n' roll bands and for Rachael Ray, the television personality. So starting about three years ago, they began buying fixer-uppers to rent or flip, eventually amassing six, two of them waterfront, in Hampton Bays and East Quogue. For capital, they used an assist from her father and the proceeds from the sale of a two-bedroom Upper East Side co-op for just over $1.2 million in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They themselves live in East Quogue, in a waterfront cottage with three bedrooms and one bath that they purchased for $450,000 in 2015. They added a sunroom and now enjoy the ''peace and quiet and accessibility to the city,'' said Mr. de Korte, who is 62.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We go out to have lunch in the backyard, and there are swans that come up to the dock,'' Ms. de Korte, 53, added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for their business: ''Our broker is begging us to sell waterfront properties because there aren't enough of them, and the prices are climbing much faster than homes not on the water,'' said Mr. de Korte, who has cut back a bit but still works for Rachael Ray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 17 years, Enzo Morabito, an associate broker with <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, sold luxury properties in Sagaponack, Bridgehampton, East Hampton and Montauk. Seven years ago, when he moved west to Westhampton Beach so his son could be in its school district, Mr. Morabito began concentrating on luxury waterfront sales from East Quogue to Remsenburg. ''The price differential is so great it is unsustainable,'' he said, with the eastern Hamptons ''getting priced out'' across the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary DePersia, an associate broker with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said he expected the west would soon start making inroads on the cachet and prices of the east. His $24.95 million listing for a six-year-old shingle-style oceanfront house with nine bedrooms on three acres in Quogue, the priciest of the western beach towns, ''would be $60 or $70 million on Meadow Lane'' in Southampton Village, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Someone will come along and say, 'Why shouldn't I be buying this here, instead of spending two or three times the amount east of the canal?' '' Mr. DePersia said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summer rentals are also less expensive to the west. In Quogue, a 1993 contemporary house, with eight bedrooms and eight and a half baths, a three-bedroom guest apartment, a pool and a 50-foot deepwater dock on Penniman Creek, rented from Memorial Day to Labor Day for $225,000, Mr. Morabito said, adding that a similar house farther east would rent in the mid-$300,000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Olstein, the chairman and chief investment officer of the Olstein Funds, called the Hamptons west of the canal ''an undiscovered paradise for the wealthy.'' In 1992, Mr. Olstein rebuilt a six-bedroom house with a pool on Duck Point in Remsenburg with panoramic views of Moriches Bay, purposely avoiding his Wall Street friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People need to be five minutes from Billy Joel, and I don't care about Billy Joel,'' said Mr. Olstein, 73, whose house is on the market for $6,950,000 because of an illness in the family. ''I didn't want to be out in the hub of society and the parties. I do that all week. I wanted to escape, be out there in an hour and a half and respectfully turn down every invitation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers, of course, are also striking out for the west. Before ground was broken earlier this month for the Estates at Remsenburg, a 23-acre subdivision of custom houses, half of the development's 19 lots had sold, said Lawrence Citarelli, the developer and owner/broker of First Hampton International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a steadily growing demographic shift of people wanting to sell east and buy west,'' he said. ''It is for those who want a little bit of quiet, not the pound-the-chest mentality.'' With the beaches, shopping and concerts in the gazebo on Main Street in Westhampton Beach, and jet service at Francis S. Gabreski Airport in Westhampton Beach, he said, ''no matter how you slice it, this side screams value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction is scheduled to start next spring for 37 townhouses with three bedrooms and three baths at the Boat Houses at Shinnecock in Hampton Bays, which will have boat slips and a dock on the eastern bank of the canal. The price tag? $1.6 million-plus each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hampton Bays is a special location with a lot of waterfront opportunity,'' said Gregg Rechler, a managing partner of <span class="companylink">Rechler Equity Partners</span>, the developer of the project. He's a boater, he says, and to be able to get to the ocean, Shinnecock Bay and Peconic Bay ''is kind of amazing.'' Across the canal on the west side, he is also redeveloping the old Canoe Place Inn as an inn and catering hall. ''The great thing about Hampton Bays is you are between two of the best towns,'' he said. Westhampton Beach is about 20 minutes west; Southampton Village is roughly 20 minutes east.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the 24-unit townhouse condo Ponquogue Point in Hampton Bays, six units have sold, some with water views. Prices range from the mid-$600,000s to $1.6 million, Mr. Citarelli said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maria Cunneen, an associate broker with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said east of the canal ''will always have the allure,'' but many younger buyers seeking a nice place out of the city to hike, surf and paddle board are having ''that aha moment,'' realizing ''west of the canal is offering them a lot more bang for the buck.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Boaters want docking and access to the water,'' Ms. Cunneen added. ''It is untouchable east of the canal for them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: September 4, 2016, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A cover article last Sunday about beach towns on Long Island west of the Shinnecock Canal described incorrectly a group of bayfront properties for sale in Hampton Bays. They are listed by various agents working for different companies; they are not all listings of Todd Bourgard of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>. The article also described incorrectly a nine-acre shorefront property listed by Mr. Bourgard. It is under contract; it has not sold. In addition, an accompanying map misspelled the name of a beach. It is Cupsogue Beach, not Cupsoque Beach.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Donald Trump sold a Palm Beach, Fla., estate for $95 million, making it the most expensive single residential property ever sold in town. Now the property is about to set another record -- as Palm Beach's most expensive tear-down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Backhoes and dump trucks have started crushing and carting away the 61,744-square-foot French provincial home at 515 North County Road, along with an 8,200-square-foot tennis house, a pool house and a carriage house. While such tear-downs have become common in Palm Beach and other high-end resort towns, the demolition of the six-acre estate known as Maison de l'Amitié, or House of Friendship, represents a new level of disposable wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bought by Mr. Trump in 2004 for $41 million and sold in 2008 to a Russian billionaire for $95 million, the residence has since sat empty, a monument to the housing bubble and to Trump's outsize salesmanship. The big question now is what will come next for one of Palm Beach's biggest white elephants and whether its value can ever reach its 2008 record price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to town planning documents, the owner of the property, a limited liability company linked to the Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, plans to split the property into three parcels that will be sold. Last week, the Palm Beach Town Council approved the owner's proposal to subdivide the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unclear when the properties will be listed. Brokers say each parcel, at around two acres, would have to sell for $35 million to $40 million for the owner to make a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an aggressive price,'' said Gary Pohrer, a real estate agent in Palm Beach. ''It's possible. But it could take a long time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The history of the property is filled with financial ups and downs. It was once owned by Robert Dun Douglass, a member of the Dun &amp; Bradstreet family. The property was sold in 1930 to Harrison Williams, an electric utility tycoon said to be one of the richest men in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After successive owners and building changes, the property was bought in 1988 for $12.08 million by Abraham Gosman, a Massachusetts nursing home and health care magnate. Mr. Gosman built the current mansion on the property. But after his business faltered and his debts piled up from lavish spending, Mr. Gosman filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, as part of the bankruptcy, the property went up for auction. Mr. Trump topped at least two other bidders with an offer of $41.35 million. After the sale, he told The <span class="companylink">Palm Beach Daily News</span> that he would turn the estate into the ''second-greatest house in America,'' after his Mar-a-Lago home down the road. He would then sell it to ''create terrific value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extent of Mr. Trump's improvements after the purchase remain unclear. Mr. Trump initially said he had ''gutted the house'' and made $25 million in extensive renovations. Yet in the application for demolition, filed in February, the architect for the project said that the 2005 and 2006 renovations were limited to a new kitchen, the creation of new bedrooms and bathrooms, and ''some minor interior alterations of doors, frames and windows.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump put the home on the market in 2006 for $125 million, making it the most expensive listing in America at the time. When no buyers emerged and Mr. Trump replaced several brokers, he trimmed the price to $120 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the summer of 2008, just before the real estate market crashed, Mr. Trump found his buyer: Mr. Rybolovlev, a former medical student who took his fertilizer company public in 2007 and later moved to Switzerland and Monaco. He had toured several homes in Palm Beach but hadn't found what he wanted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I showed him five big oceanfront homes,'' said Carol Digges, a real estate broker representing Mr. Rybolovlev at the time. ''But he said, 'I want something more grand, something bigger.''' When she showed him Maison de l'Amitié, Mr. Rybolovlev was impressed and eventually negotiated a deal. Mr. Trump maintains he sold the property for $100 million, yet people involved in the deal, as well as the sales deed, put the price at $95 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Mr. Rybolovlev said he bought the property as an investment. ''This acquisition is simply an investment,'' he said in a statement and ''does not represent a decision by me to live in the U.S.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technically, the buyer was a limited liability company, County Road Property L.L.C., which is controlled by an offshore trust benefiting members of the Rybolovlev family. Mr. Rybolovlev was named in the Panama Papers (the leaked documents that disclosed information on offshore entities of the wealthy) as having used offshore trusts to hold assets, though a spokesman said the trusts were used for ''asset protection and estate planning.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet according to Mr. Rybolovlev's ex-wife, Elena, Mr. Rybolovlev may have had other reasons to pay a high price for the property and to use offshore trusts. When the limited liability company bought the property, the Rybolovlevs were in the midst of a bitter divorce. Mr. Rybolovlev's ex-wife accused him in a lawsuit of ''secreting and transferring assets in order to avoid his obligations,'' and she sought half of the Palm Beach house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rybolovlev denied the claims, adding that the trusts were created years before the divorce. Last fall, the two reached a settlement and agreed to end all legal actions related to the divorce, including the claims over the Palm Beach property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the eight years after the purchase, Mr. Rybolovlev quietly entertained offers on the home, according to local brokers, but none met his asking price of more than $125 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the Palm Beach Architectural Commission approved the demolition of the estate. According to brokers and neighbors, crews have been working daily at the site with an oversize backhoe and bulldozer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The limited liability company has also submitted a request to the town to subdivide the land into three parcels. The proposal calls for the largest lot, at the southern end, to be 2.35 acres, with the potential to include a house of more than 51,000 square feet with 10 bedrooms and 12 baths. The other two parcels would be just under two acres, able to accommodate homes of 42,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Palm Beach, the biggest land prize is ocean frontage. The largest parcel would have 173 linear feet on the water, while the other two would have about 150. To receive the expected asking price, the parcels would have to sell for more than $215,000 a linear foot of ocean frontage. Brokers say most recent sales of Palm Beach oceanfront went for about $100,000 to $120,000 a linear foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth Griffin, the hedge fund manager, has spent more than $120 million in Palm Beach to buy and combine four parcels of land, which brokers say worked out to be more than $200,000 a linear foot. Mr. Rybolovlev's property is considered among the best on the island -- close to the town center and with direct access to the beach. Some brokers say it could well top the Griffin price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I suspect one person will buy all three parcels of land and keep it as one estate,'' said Angela Koch, a Palm Beach real estate broker. ''All it takes is another Ken Griffin.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks on Wall Street posted modest gains on Tuesday, bringing indexes nearly back to the record levels they reached last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building companies rose sharply following a big increase in sales of new homes last month, and <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> soared after the electronics retailer reported a surge in profit as online sales increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average rose 17.88 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,547.30. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index rose 4.26 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,186.90 and the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite rose 15.47 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,260.08.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was another quiet day in trading on Wall Street. Volume on the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span> was again below 3 billion shares, making it one of the slowest days of the year. Monday was the slowest day so far in 2016. Investors have had little in the way of economic data or company news to react to for the last couple of weeks, and many traders are on vacation in the ending days of summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week’s biggest event is Friday, when the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, is scheduled to speak at an annual conference of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The Fed is not expected to raise interest rates at its September meeting, but Ms. Yellen’s comments will be dissected for clues on the likelihood and timing of a future increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors did respond positively to a survey from the 19-country eurozone that showed business activity expanded in August at a modest but steady pace. It was a sign that companies were not overly worried about Britain’s decision to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>. The <span class="companylink">IHS Markit</span> survey of purchasing managers also reached a seven-month high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government bond prices were little changed. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note held steady at 1.55 percent. The dollar slipped to 100.22 yen from 100.29 yen late Monday. The euro fell to $1.1305 from $1.1323.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The DAX in Germany closed up 0.9 percent, and the CAC-40 in France rose 0.7 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 0.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks also benefited from news that Americans stepped up their purchases of new homes[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/24/upshot/the-housing-market-is-finally-starting-to-look-healthy.html?ref=business] in July at the fastest pace in nearly nine years. <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, the luxury home builder rose nearly 9 percent, while <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> and <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> rose about 3 percent each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In individual companies, <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> surged $6.43, or 20 percent, to $39.23 after the retailer reported results that beat analysts’ estimates. Notably, <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> said sales in stores open at least a year rose in the latest quarter, a sign that the company’s turnaround strategy is working in the face of strong competition from Amazon and other online retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drug maker Mylan fell $2.28, or 5 percent, to $45.62, the second-biggest drop in the S &amp; P. 500, following growing outrage over the skyrocketing price increases [http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/08/22/epipen-price-rise-sparks-concern-for-allergy-sufferers]for Mylan’s EpiPen product, which is used treat people who may be suffering from a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans and Democrats in Congress have started asking questions about Mylan’s price increases. The EpiPen, invented in the 1970s, used to be roughly $100 for two pens only a few years ago, but now costs roughly $600 for the same two pens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude oil[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/oil-petroleum-and-gasoline/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] closed up 69 cents to $48.10 a barrel while Brent crude, used to price oil internationally, rose 80 cents to $49.96.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other energy trading, heating oil[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/heating_oil/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] rose 1.5 cents to $1.502 a gallon, wholesale gasoline rose 1.5 cents to $1.499 a gallon and natural gas rose 8 cents to $2.761 per thousand cubic feet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices in the United States were unchanged in July thanks to falling gasoline costs, but solid gains in industrial output and home building suggested a pickup in economic activity that could allow the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to raise interest rates this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's mixed reports came as William C. Dudley, the influential president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the central bank could increase rates next month, citing a tightening labor market that he said was starting to spur faster wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York, said: ''The strong housing starts and industrial output performance will bolster the Fed confidence that growth momentum has rebounded, potentially supporting the bias for a near-term hike. Nevertheless, with inflation continuing to miss to the downside, the case for caution remains strong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's flat reading in the Consumer Price Index from the Labor Department was the weakest since February and followed two straight monthly increases of 0.2 percent. In the 12 months through July, the C.P.I. rose 0.8 percent after increasing 1.0 percent in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The so-called core C.P.I., which strips out the volatile food and energy components, edged up 0.1 percent in July. It had risen by 0.2 percent in each of the previous three months. The year-on-year core C.P.I. increased 2.2 percent in July after advancing 2.3 percent in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks a measure of inflation that has been stuck at 1.6 percent since March. ''It's possible'' for the Fed to raise rates at its policy meeting on Sept. 20 and 21, Mr. Dudley told <span class="companylink">Fox Business Network</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were increases in the costs of hospital services, doctor visits and prescription medicine. Rents increased a solid 0.3 percent. But Americans got some relief from gasoline prices, which dropped 4.7 percent last month, the first decline since February, reflecting renewed declines in crude oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite benign inflation, economic growth is picking up after output averaged 1.0 percent in the first half of the year. In a separate report, the Fed said industrial production shot up 0.7 percent last month after rising 0.4 percent in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production was bolstered by a 0.5 percent jump in manufacturing output, the largest gain since July 2015. Warmer-than-usual weather caused utilities to raise production by 2.1 percent while mining output increased 0.7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a third report, the Commerce Department said housing starts increased 2.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.2 million units in July, the highest level since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's increase in groundbreaking activity supports the view that investment in residential construction will rebound after slumping in the second quarter for the first time in more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreaking on single-family homes, the largest segment of the market, rose 0.5 percent to a 770,000-unit pace in July, also the highest level since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts for the volatile multifamily segment increased 5.0 percent to a 441,000-unit pace. The multifamily segment of the market continues to be supported by strong demand for rental accommodation as some Americans shun homeownership after the housing market collapse.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks on Wall Street closed at a record high Monday. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued its recent recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Makers of chemicals and mining companies made the biggest gains, and machinery companies and banks followed. Investors sold government bonds and utility and phone companies. Those stocks had climbed earlier in the year as investors sought safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average climbed 59.58 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,636.05. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.10 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,190.15. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite added 29.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,262.02.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks have seesawed between small gains and losses for more than a week as investors consider mixed reports on the health of the economy and a decline in corporate earnings. That has not stopped them from setting records, but investors remain wary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market has run up in anticipation of better earnings ahead,'' said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist for TIAA Investments. ''If those earnings don't come, we have the Wile E. Coyote moment where we're off the cliff,'' Mr. Nick said, adding, ''and we're going to fall.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second-quarter earnings are nearly all in the books, with this week's releases from <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> and Target among the last to appear. Corporate earnings are down once again this quarter. Investors don't expect much growth in the third quarter either, but they are starting to expect improvement after that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benchmark crude oil jumped $1.25, or 2.8 percent, to $45.74 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark used to price international oils, rose $1.38, or 2.9 percent, to $48.35 a barrel in London. After a steep slide for most of June and July, the price of United States crude oil gained 6.4 percent last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drilling rig operator Transocean added 53 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $10.43. <span class="companylink">National Oilwell Varco</span> picked up $1.04, or 3.1 percent, to $34.85, and <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> rose 81 cents, or 2 percent, to $42.18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chemicals company <span class="companylink">LyondellBasell Industries</span> rose $2.16, or 2.9 percent, to $77.49. The mining and energy company <span class="companylink">Freeport-McMoRan</span> climbed 36 cents, or 3 percent, to $12.17. The aluminum producer Alcoa gained 35 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $10.52.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Utility companies took the largest losses: <span class="companylink">Southern Company</span> declined 86 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.49. <span class="companylink">Consolidated Edison</span> sank $1.88, or 2.4 percent, to $76.24. Phone companies and household goods makers also slipped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Mid-America Apartment Communities</span>, the real estate investment trust, will buy competitor <span class="companylink">Post Properties</span> for about $3.9 billion in stock. Both companies own large numbers of rental properties, and demand for rentals has boomed in recent years because many people are being priced out of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Post Properties</span>' stock rose $5.86, or 9.4 percent, to $68.08. Mid-America stock lost $5, or 4.9 percent, to $97.15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey showed that homebuilders in the United States are more optimistic about the market as prices and sales of new homes rise. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index rose from last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, new home sales grew by the fastest pace in eight years, aided by continuing job growth and low mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The August contract for gold rose $4.50 to $1,340.30 an ounce. Silver gained 14 cents to $19.85 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.15 a pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar fell to 101.2 yen from 101.23 yen, and the euro rose to $1.1184 from $1.116.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The DAX in Germany was up 0.2 percent, and the CAC 40 of France dipped less than 0.1 percent. The British FTSE 100 gained 0.4 percent. The Nikkei 225 in Japan edged up 0.3 percent, and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong rose 0.7 percent.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JACK HEALY </div><div>2255 words</div><div>4 August 2016</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2016 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Hutchings bet it all when he built his 3,300-square-foot dream home on a strip of rock-strewn desert gazing west toward the Las Vegas Strip. He had made a fortune building custom homes as Vegas boomed higher and higher, and for his own, he chose red Spanish tiles, wrought iron and silky white plaster. A guesthouse? Sure. Swimming pool? Of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was 2006. You know what happened next. Today, more than eight years after the housing crash, Mr. Hutchings, 49, owes about $800,000 on a property that has not recovered its value from the bubble days. As neighbors lost their homes to foreclosure, he started to hear gunshots and see stray dogs roaming the streets here around Sunrise Mountain. A drug dealer moved in down the block. Over the protests of his wife, Terrisa, Mr. Hutchings now stashes an unloaded shotgun in the bedroom closet and a handgun in the kitchen cabinets, tucked beside the glassware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He could walk away from his mortgage and lose the $580,000 he has paid, or he can keep pouring his savings into the same hole. It is a mess with no good choices, he said, just like the presidential election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He will vote Republican, but Clinton or Trump — either way, it feels like a losing wager, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The whole system’s kind of broke,’’ he said. ‘‘We’re trying to reinvent ourselves, trying to run businesses, trying to pretend like it’s 2003 again. And it’s not.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hutchings said he had watched the presidential race with growing nausea, as Donald J. Trump feuded with the Muslim parents of an Army captain killed in Iraq and urged Russia to release Hillary Clinton’s emails. He said that the Democrats were exploiting a military family’s grief for political purposes, but that the election was becoming a mixed-martial-arts fight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I did blink,’’ he said. But he still, warily, supports Mr. Trump. ‘‘It sort of puts a little bit of acid in the stomach,’’ he said. ‘‘I just don’t know what this world’s going to be like in 90 days. I have never been more confused about my country.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas is a glittering promise built on a simple truth: The house always wins. But years after rotten loans and plunging home values made Las Vegas the center of the housing crisis, thousands of people have yet to recover from the cataclysm that tipped the United States economy into a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with new resorts springing up on the Strip, home values recovering and record numbers of visitors pouring back to this American playground, thousands of people in golf-course mansions, gated condominiums and stucco starter homes are still stuck in 2008, battling with their banks, owing more than their homes are worth, trying to negotiate a sale to avoid foreclosure. To visit this underwater America is to take a tour of too-easy money, bad choices and worse luck, and of the way the economic toll of the Great Recession still haunts much of America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They blame themselves, but their scorn for banks and bailouts runs as wide and hot as the desert. The crash tarnished their faith in that core American belief that buying a house was a foolproof path to security and prosperity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing sales and prices are rebounding across Las Vegas, but the market was in such a deep pit that families who bought at the peak or borrowed against their homes say they may never see any return on their $240,000 starter home. Some who walked away are bouncing from rental to rental, negotiating bankruptcies and trying to fix their credit. And they say the tepid job market — Nevada’s unemployment rate is 6.4 percent, up slightly in the most recent government survey — is an added weight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To them, the economic recovery was a fickle storm that brought rain to some parched farms while skipping theirs. The frenzied market for million-dollar studio apartments in Manhattan and seven-figure bungalows in Los Angeles might as well be another planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ‘last stand’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Marine veteran, Mr. Hutchings is now a block captain for the neighborhood association near Sunrise Mountain, 10 miles east of the Strip. Like many residents of the scattered American cities where violent crime is rising, he got so concerned that he installed iron gates and 12 security cameras to watch over his 1-year-old son, Maxim, and 3-year-old daughter, Natalia, as they play. When he takes them to the park, he goes armed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One afternoon, Maxim was speed-crawling across the sunset-colored kitchen tiles, and Natalia was changing from sundress to sundress and dancing with abandon. She sensed a move could be in the future, and was already making plans for where her dolls would go in her new room. Her mother, a choreographer from Australia, seemed ready to fight to stay. She and Mr. Hutchings had their wedding reception in the backyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘This is something you don’t walk away from,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hutchings frowned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I’m like, here’s another payment walking out the door,’’ he said. ‘‘There’s another semester of college gone.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He stepped outside and glanced toward the glittering golden Wynn and Trump hotels, the fake New York skyline and onyx pyramid. There are a lot of troubled homes between here and there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One in four homeowners in the Las Vegas area owes more to the bank than his or her home is worth, according to RealtyTrac. That is the third-highest rate in the United States, behind Cleveland and Akron, Ohio. And though prices are recovering, they are still below the frenzy of 2005, when people lined up for open houses and bought homes for nothing down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hutchings skimmed through the neighborhood’s hodgepodge of upper-middle-class wealth and suburban decay. Manicured mansions border a Mormon temple at the foot of Frenchman Mountain. Down the hill, old horse pens are ringed with graffiti on a street where, Mr. Hutchings said, he once found shell casings. One minute, he seemed ready to give up. The next, he was determined to keep up the fight with his bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘This is my last stand,’’ he said. ‘‘I’m like that old farmer who won’t get off his property.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he drove, he raved about ‘‘Plutocrats,’’ a book by Chrystia Freeland that critiques the rise of the superrich. He also reflected on the two times he had met Mr. Trump, at a Florida nightclub and a real estate event. ‘‘Just a supercool guy,’’ he said. ‘‘Nothing like he is on TV.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a city whose skyline bears his name, many people have a Trump story. Mayor Carolyn G. Goodman said she had met him about 15 years ago when she and her husband, Oscar, then the mayor, made a pilgrimage to Trump Tower to discuss redeveloping 61 acres of old rail yards. Ms. Goodman said her husband had envisioned a kaleidoscope of architectural styles. Mr. Trump insisted on one look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I had such a headache when I left,’’ Ms. Goodman said, sitting in her seventh-floor office. ‘‘Two bigger egos there are not.’’ Downtown Las Vegas and the Strip spread from her window to the horizon. On her desk were photos of her with celebrities and politicians, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the comedian Carrot Top.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Goodman has rotated from Republican to Democrat to nonpartisan, and said the recovery had been too slow. Her calendar is full of meetings with investors from China and Australia with high-rise dreams. But one of her own sons is upside-down on his mortgage, she said. It all has left her uncertain of which candidate, if any, to support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hillary?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘No. Next question.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trump?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘No.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I’m really praying that between now and November there’s some clarity, that somebody shows some leadership,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selling to avoid foreclosure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leave the lofty office and drive north, to a quiet suburban street across from an elementary-school parking lot where Mark and Anna Lissor taught their son, and now their grandson, to ride a bike. The Lissors are hitting retirement age, but they owe about $500,000 on an overdue home-equity loan they used to remodel their house. They are hoping to negotiate a short sale for less than the value of their loan. It would spare them foreclosure, at least.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I was so stupid,’’ Ms. Lissor said. ‘‘How could I be so naïve? I just didn’t realize what was going to happen. Our balance was going up every month, every month. And then everything plummeted. And we were in the hole.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lissors are Republicans: He wears a ‘‘One Nation Under God’’ T-shirt, and their car has a <span class="companylink">National Rifle Association</span> sticker. Still, Ms. Lissor gives President Obama credit for creating programs that sought to keep people in their homes. But she said the bailouts had ended up favoring banks over typical homeowners. She sees Mrs. Clinton as a liar and a cog in a rigged system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Shawn, their grandson, tumbled across the living room couch in a Captain America muscle outfit, Mr. Lissor walked into his study and pulled up the real estate listings for the neighborhood. A galaxy of blue dots filled the computer screen, each representing a house at some stage of the foreclosure process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘There’s one down the street,’’ he said. He clicked over to his home, a red dot up for sale to satisfy the bank. ‘‘I don’t care what they sell it for. I’m getting nothing out of it.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘They brush us off’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Head to the northern fringe of town, where waves of new homes run abruptly into an eternity of desert. The Jansons live here, in a peach-colored house they bought for about $290,000 at the height of the bubble. It was their dream home, with enough space for their growing and grown children and grandchildren, for the Christmases when they set up two trees and cooked for 20 relatives. They are trying desperately to hold on to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are all Democrats, and staunch Clinton supporters. They worry that a Trump presidency would be a pipeline to the rich and stifle government programs to help workers or the poor. One afternoon, with the blinds drawn against the summer sun, they watched the political aftermath of the Dallas police shootings play out on <span class="companylink">CNN</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘If Trump gets in there, we’re in deep trouble,’’ said Josephine Janson, 55.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Christmas, her husband, Kevin Janson, 56, lost his $20-an-hour job as a security guard at MGM Grand and took a replacement gig at a downtown casino for $12 an hour. Ms. Janson was getting fewer and fewer hours at the jewelry counter at <span class="companylink">Kohl’s</span>. Then, in June, she was hospitalized with a severe potassium deficiency, and said she had lost her job the day she returned to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family started to strain to make $2,000 monthly payments on a loan that, even at the best of times, ‘‘was a little bit beyond our means,’’ Mr. Janson said. As the house’s value sank, they owed more than it might ever be worth. They spent $3,500 and countless hours to modify the loan and reduce the payments to a more manageable $1,500 a month. They have Mr. Janson’s paycheck and his pension as a retired member of the Air Force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘We can probably do it, but just barely,’’ Mr. Janson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of their friends and neighbors sold at a loss or walked away from their homes, but the Jansons decided to stay. When he drives home from work every day at midnight, he skims past signs for sparkling new houses — Harmony Homes! The Preserve! — but the house is all the family has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘What we have is what we’re sitting in,’’ Mr. Janson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their oldest daughter, Amanda Bumgardner, 29, was living at home with her three children as she waited for her husband to finish an Air Force tour in Arkansas. Last month, they moved to New Mexico. She is riveted to the news: of the presidential campaigns, the turmoil over race and policing. She keeps <span class="companylink">CNN</span> playing like a night light as she and her children go to sleep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One afternoon, as he sat at the kitchen table, Mr. Janson expressed frustration that had been building for months. ‘‘It just seems like the harder you work, the more punctual you are, the more integrity you have — none of that matters anymore,’’ he said. ‘‘It stinks. They brush us off like a crumb off the table.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went upstairs, into the closet just off the bedroom where their 2-year-old grandson, Peyton, often curls up with them at night. Mr. Janson keeps a ham radio there, and when the children were growing up, he would tune the dials and bring them voices from Alaska, California, the Cook Islands in the South Pacific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Ms. Bumgardner sifted through the children’s clothes and princess dresses tucked in the closet, debating what to take with her to New Mexico and what to leave, Mr. Janson spun the tuning knob and threw out his handle: ‘‘KC7ZOH, Las Vegas, Nevada, looking for any stations.’’ He listened through the static, waiting for someone to answer.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.S. hunts for dirty money in luxury real estate deals</span>
</div><div class="author">By LOUISE STORY </div><div>673 words</div><div>29 July 2016</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>14</div><div>English</div><div>© 2016 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a quarter of the all-cash luxury home purchases made using shell companies in Manhattan and Miami were flagged as suspicious in a new effort to unearth money laundering in real estate, the Treasury Department said. As a result, officials said they would expand the program to other areas across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expansion of the effort to identify and track the people behind shell companies, begun in March, means that there will now be increased scrutiny of luxury real estate purchases made in cash in all five boroughs of New York City, counties north of Miami, Los Angeles County, San Diego County, the three counties around San Francisco and the county that includes San Antonio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The examination, known as a geographic targeting order, is part of a broad effort by the federal government to crack down on money laundering and secretive shell companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The information we have obtained from our initial G.T.O.s suggests that we are on the right track,’’ Jamal El-Hindi, the acting director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network within the Treasury, said in a department news release on Wednesday. ‘‘By expanding the G.T.O.s to other major cities, we will learn even more about the money laundering risks in the national real estate markets, helping us determine our future regulatory course.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the suspicious transactions that the Treasury Department found tied to sales in New York or Miami this year were a $16 million cash withdrawal, a person involved in counterfeit checks and someone involved in moving $7 million around in shell companies associated with South America, Treasury officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The areas being added to the order are places where buyers frequently purchase luxury real estate using shell companies, the officials said. The dollar values involved purchases of more than $500,000 or more in Bexar County, which includes San Antonio; $1 million in Florida; $2 million in California; $3 million in Manhattan; and $1.5 million in the other boroughs of New York City. Title insurance companies, which are involved in virtually all real estate transactions, are charged with carrying out the order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury officials have said that their real estate tracking program was inspired in part by a series last year in The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> that examined the rising use of shell companies. The investigation found that real estate professionals, especially in the luxury market, often do not know much about buyers, and it uncovered numerous buyers of high-end real estate who had been subject to government investigations around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One installment of The Times’s investigation documented properties purchased in shell companies by friends and family of the prime minister of Malaysia. Those properties were subject to the largest asset forfeiture order ever in a kleptocracy case, which was announced this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury officials said they were seeing benefits to the program in Manhattan and Miami, citing an increase in suspicious-activity reports being filed by banks and noting that the Department of Justice is finding the combination of the real estate and banking information to be helpful in its investigations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broadening of the rule signifies that the Treasury Department thinks the benefits to law enforcement from this sort of data collection are likely worth the cost to the industry, said Eric Berg, a lawyer at <span class="companylink">Foley &amp; Lardner</span> in Milwaukee and former member of the kleptocracy unit at the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘There’s a lot of pushback from industry,’’ Mr. Berg said. ‘‘Clearly some sort of internal dialogue came to the conclusion that this is worth doing.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the title companies are ordered to identify the buyers, the burden often falls to the real estate agent, said Aaron Leider, the president of the Beverly Hills/Greater Los Angeles Association of Realtors and owner of the Keller Williams agency in Brentwood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘They come to us, because who knows the client?’’ he said. ‘‘They don’t know the client.’’</p>

</div><div class="author">By VIVIAN MARINO </div><div>1374 words</div><div>24 July 2016</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Corbisiero wanted a quick sale on his studio pied-à-terre in West Chelsea, as he planned to use a portion of the proceeds for his daughter's looming college expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he and his wife, Julie, who live in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, were thrilled when three bids emerged within a week. Two were all cash. ''The other buyer preferred to do it with financing,'' said Mr. Corbisiero, an independent stock trader. ''But why should I wait for them to get a mortgage?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale closed in March, just two months after the unit was listed. It went to one of the mortgage-less buyers, who sweetened the pot by paying $20,000 above the $1.195 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any competitive market, all-cash offers typically win out. In neighborhoods and at price points where inventory is tight and bidding wars almost a certainty, the financing-free strategy at the bargaining table has become more commonplace -- and more or less imperative, some real estate brokers say. A key advantage is that these deals are done more quickly than financed transactions, which appeals to sellers like the Corbisieros. There is no lender red tape to slow down the process, like appraisal requirements and concerns about whether those appraisals will come in high enough and whether buyers can borrow as much as they need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, not everyone has the means to make such a hefty purchase with cash, and even those who do may not want to deplete their savings and investment accounts for a single real estate deal. Nationwide, cash sales accounted for a little more than a third of all home sales at the start of this year, according to the research firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. But in Manhattan, that figure is higher, and rises with price: In the first half of 2016, more than 44 percent of all sales were cash only, and nearly 81 percent were for homes above $5 million, according to numbers compiled for <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span> by the appraiser Jonathan J. Miller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One solution for the reluctant cash buyer is to delay financing: Buy using all cash, but borrow soon after. Delayed financing can help buyers stay competitive in hot housing markets, and even negotiate a better deal, without tying up their assets for too long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are different ways to use this strategy. For more modest purchases, there is a little-known <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> program that took effect five years ago. It allows certain buyers without mortgages to obtain a cash-out refinance soon after closing on a home -- which means they can get much of their cash back almost immediately. (Before the delayed-financing program began, borrowers had to wait at least six months before tapping into home equity.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These policies were instituted after the real estate meltdown, to help get the market moving again,'' said Steven A. Milner, the chief executive of the US Mortgage Corporation in Melville, N.Y. The intent was to provide a borrowing option for problem properties that might not initially qualify for a mortgage, but likely could qualify after they were fixed up and maintained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In order to participate in the <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> program, borrowers must show, among other things, that there are no liens against the home and must document the sources of the cash for the purchase. They must also prove that the sale was at ''arm's length,'' meaning they didn't buy the property from a relative or close business associate. Borrowers, however, are limited in how much they can cash out, depending on whether the property is a primary or second home. A maximum of 70 percent of its appraised value is allowed, according to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, up to local conforming loan standards -- in Manhattan, that means a $625,500 loan amount on a single-family home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For larger purchases, in which the maximum-percent cash out would exceed the amount in the conforming loan standards -- often the case in pricier markets like New York City -- cash buyers can opt for delayed financing through non-agency ''jumbo'' loans that are not subject to borrowing limits and the strict conventional rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Someone puts in an all-cash offer and takes their liquid assets to buy the property for all cash, and then gets preapproval for a loan,'' said Bradley Wayman, the mortgage sales director at Citibank in Manhattan. ''In many cases, they'll have a loan in process and close with all cash.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Milner said that these types of delayed financing transactions account for around 2 percent of his business, while Mr. Wayman said, ''On average, our top loan lenders do one deal per month.'' And most of those deals, he said, involve homes priced below $4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the situation at the very high end of the market, ''when you go down the ladder, it becomes more competitive in terms of offerings -- there are a lot less of them,'' said Michael Graves, a broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, referring to homes for sale. For that reason, he advises the sellers he represents not to accept offers contingent on the buyer obtaining a mortgage. ''In the last six years, there has been only one deal where we accepted a finance contingency. It's not up to us where the cash comes from, but it must be cash.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He continued: ''Some are borrowing from their 401(k)'s; others are liquidating investments. Some are asking family members to help close. Many of them are selling another property. I've seen pretty much everything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew I. McDonald, an investment adviser specializing in the life sciences industry, relied on his stock portfolio. He was forced to abandon any plans to get a mortgage and instead offer all cash on the two-bedroom condominium in Chelsea that he bought a couple of years ago after learning of multiple bids following the first showing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's kind of crazy: You walk in and see the place for 10 minutes, and then you have to make a decision on it,'' Mr. McDonald said. ''But after looking at so many properties for a year, you just know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that ''the only way to go was all cash at the asking price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McDonald came up with the $3 million for the purchase after liquidating several investments, then three months later, took out a $1.95 million jumbo loan -- a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage at 2.5 percent with <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, he said -- that enabled him to replenish much of his investment portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His agent, Crystal Zahedi of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, who also represented Mr. Corbisiero, said, ''When you get a well-priced apartment in this market, you do have to use that strategy -- or, at the very least, have a deal not contingent on financing. That's the first step.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it's fairly common for buyers to forego a financing contingency these days, the all-cash, delayed-financing strategy has been slow to catch on, partly because many home buyers simply aren't aware of the option. (And in some co-op buildings, it also may not be feasible, because residents are required to have a certain amount of liquidity available after a purchase.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I hadn't been a real estate broker, I probably wouldn't have come up with the idea,'' said Kristin Thomas-Senior, an associate broker at Compass, who employed the delayed-financing strategy when buying a three-bedroom condominium with her wife, Fern Senior, a marketing manager, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in late 2013. ''l saw how so many of my clients had been outbid.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pair came up with $1.425 million in cash largely by selling off their stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Then, about two and a half months after closing on the property, they took out a $675,000, 10-year adjustable-rate mortgage with <span class="companylink">Citibank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This turned out to be a good move,'' Ms. Thomas-Senior said, ''because the property has since appreciated.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ </div><div>727 words</div><div>24 July 2016</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>23</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karl E. Case, an economics professor at Wellesley College who helped revolutionize how home prices are tracked by real estate professionals and home buyers alike, died on July 15 in Wellesley, Mass. He was 69.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Case had Parkinson's disease and multiple myeloma and died in a hospice near his home, his wife, Susan, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the daily ups and downs of prices for stocks and bonds have long been easy to obtain and analyze, the housing market was much more opaque when Mr. Case teamed up in the 1980s with a Yale economist, Robert Shiller, to develop an economic model to track home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two collected information like the price of the same property over time as it changed hands, and tweaked the data to account for reliability and other quirks. This created what has become the benchmark for gauging the value of the single biggest investment most Americans own: their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller Index charted the remarkable rise of housing prices in the bubble that preceded the Great Recession, its subsequent bursting, the sharp declines in 2008 and 2009, and the slow but steady recovery in the real estate market since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both men warned before the recession that the housing market was getting ahead of itself. Mr. Case presciently sounded the alarm about the danger posed by rising subprime borrowing in the decade before the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He was more connected to the business world than most academics,'' Mr. Shiller said in an interview. ''He also talked to people in the real world, like home appraisers, in order to isolate data for housing prices, which wasn't easy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karl Edwin Case, who was known as Chip, a childhood nickname, was born in New York City on Nov. 5, 1946, the son of Karl Case, a banker, and the former Lillian Collier, a homemaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Case graduated from <span class="companylink">Miami University</span> in Ohio in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in economics and then spent three years in the Army, running field hospitals in Vietnam at the height of the war there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He met his future wife, Susan Galbraith, when the two were undergraduates at Miami. They married in 1969.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to his wife, an education consultant, Mr. Case is survived by a daughter, Kristen Case, an English professor at the University of Maine at Farmington; a half brother, George Calnan; and two grandchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Case began teaching at Wellesley after earning a doctorate in economics from Harvard in 1976. His focus on housing was propelled by the real estate boom in the Boston area in the 1980s as computer companies there, like <span class="companylink">Digital Equipment Corporation</span> and Data General, prospered, foreshadowing the current boom in Silicon Valley and other tech-driven areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Case was introduced to Mr. Shiller by Sharon M. Oster, a Yale economist and colleague of Mr. Shiller's. The two men found they had complementary interests that would prove useful as they developed and expanded their index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shiller had studied bubbles in the bond and stock markets; Mr. Case was an expert on taxes and incentives, as well as low-income housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As they developed their model for broader use, Mr. Case and Mr. Shiller also showed that housing prices were not necessarily rational. Like the prices of stocks, home values are susceptible to momentum and human impulses like fear and greed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1991, the two worked with Allan Weiss, a management consultant who had studied with Mr. Shiller at Yale, to develop their model commercially. They sold it to Fiserv in 2002. Mr. Case retired from teaching at Wellesley in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From tracking four cities, the Case-Shiller data has expanded to cover dozens of cities and thousands of ZIP codes, as well as providing national benchmarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their creation is now produced by <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> and <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> and is known as the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What Case and Shiller put together is really the gold standard for price changes in the housing market,'' Edward Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard, said in an interview. ''It has the beauty of being both transparent and reliable.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By ROBERT J. SHILLER </div><div>1028 words</div><div>19 July 2016</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>14</div><div>English</div><div>© 2016 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buy land: They’re not making it anymore. That often repeated adage sounds like good financial advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over the long run, it hasn’t been. Despite solid price increases over the last few years, land and homes have actually been disappointing investments. It’s worth considering why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let’s start by looking at the numbers. The best long-term data on land in the United States is for farmland, which is valuable in its own right and can also be considered a great reservoir that can be converted to housing and other purposes at opportune times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the century from 1915 to 2015, though, the real value of American farmland (deflated by the Consumer Price Index) increased only 3.1 times, according to the <span class="companylink">United States Department of Agriculture</span>. That comes to an average increase of only 1.1 percent a year — and with a growing population, that’s barely enough to keep per capita real land value unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to my own data (relying on the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, which I helped create), real home prices rose even more slowly over the same period — a total increase of 1.8 times, which comes to an average of only 0.6 percent a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What all that amounts to is that neither farmland nor housing has been a great place to invest money over the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To put this in perspective, note that the real gross domestic product in the United States grew 15.5 times — or, on average, 3.2 percent a year — from 1929, the year official G.D.P. numbers began to be kept, to 2015. That’s a much higher growth rate than for real estate. But why?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For home prices, a good part of the answer comes from supply and demand. As prices rise, companies build more houses and the supply floods the market, keeping prices down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply response to increasing demand may help explain why real home prices nationwide fell 35 percent from 2006 to 2012 (and even more in some cities). Investment in residential structures in the United States was at near-record levels as a percentage of G.D.P. just before the price declines. Prices have been rebounding since then — and so has construction of new houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is true they aren’t making land anymore. And, in fact, farmland prices have done better than home prices over the last century as well as in the worst years for housing, the years bracketing the recent financial crisis. Real farm property values actually rose 21 percent over the full financial crisis, that is, between 2006 and 2012. For farmland, there was only a small 3 percent drop in real price from 2008 to 2009, which was quickly reversed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don’t get too excited. They aren’t making land, but because of technological advances collectively called the Green Revolution, there has been something akin to a long-term supply increase. This 20th-century miracle in agricultural science greatly improved crop yields per acre. From the standpoint of farm output, there was no need for new land. This revolution involved the discovery by Fritz Haber of a cheap process to produce ammonia for fertilizer at the beginning of the century and the discovery of new high-yield strains of wheat by Norman E. Borlaug at midcentury. Both men won Nobel Prizes for their work. These innovations permitted multiplication of yields per acre and very likely saved hundreds of millions of lives from starvation worldwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effects of this revolution are complicated. One might think that progress that improves yield per acre would put upward pressure on land prices. But that is not necessarily so, if it occurs globally and prevents food price increases that would otherwise earn farmers more revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What’s more, the food revolution may be accelerating with changes like lab-produced milk from genetically modified yeast and lab-produced meat from stem cells, eliminating the need for livestock and their pasture. This could have deleterious effects on farmland prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, underneath every home is a piece of land. Although that is typically only a bit of former farmland, it is often in an urban or suburban area, where a plot of land tends to cost much more than in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes that little piece of land dominates the value of the home, particularly in dense urban areas. But if we are to understand long-term trends, we need to realize what land represents, even in Manhattan or Silicon Valley or any booming area. People in such places usually aren’t buying land for its own sake but for the myriad services that housing provides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These services have developed enormously over the last 100 years, changing the spatial and geographic dimensions of housing. There are vastly more highways and automobiles, telephones and various electronic connections, enabling people to leave center cities and still obtain the housing services they want. Thus, from a long-term perspective, these developments relieved a great deal of the upward pressure on home prices in cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, there are some interesting developments in the supply of housing services that economize even further on urban land. We have recently seen interest in ‘‘micro-apartments,’’ which may be little more than 200 square feet but manage to squeeze in a kitchen, a bathroom and an entertainment center. For many people, this tiny space, with its proximity to like-minded people, interesting neighborhoods and restaurants, is preferable to living in a house in a far-flung suburb. Already, rules are being changed in many cities, including New York, allowing the little apartments to be built and to accommodate many more people per acre of city land. These factors could lead to near-zero future demands on valuable urban land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you add all this together, the slow long-term pace of farmland and home price increases is not surprising. Nor would it be shocking if this trend continued for the next century, despite price surges over the last few years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BANKING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking for Signs of rebound after poor first-quarter marks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bank of America[http://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/bank-of-america-corporation?inline=nyt-org] announced its second-quarter financial results[http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2016/07/18/business/18reuters-bank-of-america-results.html] on Monday, with Goldman Sachs[http://cms.em.nytimes.com/content/publish/preview?contentId=100000004535032&amp;branchName=web] following on Tuesday and Morgan Stanley[http://cms.em.nytimes.com/content/publish/preview?contentId=100000004535032&amp;branchName=web] on Wednesday. The big banks that released their results last week generally [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/14/business/dealbook/wall-street-earnings.html] reported[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/14/business/dealbook/wall-street-earnings.html] better-than-expected earnings, particularly after a first quarter that was one of the worst in years. Investors will be looking for signals on how the banks are responding to the continuing lull in interest rates, which has made it more difficult to earn money through lending. After Britain’s vote last month to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, the banks are also likely to be heavily questioned on what they are now planning to do with their operations in London.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A raft of earnings reports from old-guard technology companies will say much about the transition to the new-tech world of cloud computing, mobility and artificial intelligence. IBM[http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/ibm], which is trying to get other companies to use its Watson supercomputer, will report its second-quarter results on Monday, as will Yahoo[http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/yhoo], the once-giant internet portal that is selling core assets. Microsoft[http://cms.em.nytimes.com/content/publish/preview?contentId=100000004535032&amp;branchName=web], a leader in cloud computing, reports on Tuesday. The chip companies Intel[http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/intc], a titan in the personal computer days that fell short in mobile, and Qualcomm[http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/qcom], a mobile leader that has run into competitive woes, are on Wednesday. On Friday, <span class="companylink">General Electric</span>, a century-old manufacturer looking to lead in the sensor-driven internet of things, will also report.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Brexit’ questions for central bank leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> will meet in Frankfurt on Thursday, but it is not expected to make any major changes to monetary policy[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/03/business/international/ecb-interest-rates-meeting.html]. Mario Draghi, the central bank’s president, will hold his first news conference since Britain voted to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> and will certainly be asked how “Brexit” might affect monetary policy. Mr. Draghi will probably also be asked about his views on how Europe should deal with a worsening banking crisis in Italy, his home country[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/business/dealbook/italys-plan-for-banks-could-roil-europe.html]. Barring any striking developments, analysts expect the central bank to hold off from any action at least until September. Jack Ewing

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales are expected to have been strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, at 10 a.m. E.D.T., the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> will release data on sales of existing homes[http://www.realtor.org/topics/existing-home-sales] in June. Last month, the association reported[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/business/economy/existing-home-sales-surged-in-may-reaching-9-year-high.html] that home sales in May ran at their healthiest rate since February 2007, before the housing market collapsed and the economy fell into recession. While economists expect a slight moderation in the pace of sales for June, low mortgage rates are expected to keep annual sales at a healthy annualized level of about 5.5 million units. Nelson D.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comic-Con International opens in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comic book fans are getting their capes and cowls primed for their annual pilgrimage to Comic-Con International[http://www.comic-con.org/], which opens on Thursday in San Diego. The event has evolved in recent years into a showcase for Hollywood studios, which will be clamoring for the attention of an army of nerds expected to exceed 130,000. Virtual reality will have a big presence: FX Networks is promoting “American Horror Story” with a virtual reality experience, and <span class="companylink">Warner Bros</span>. has similar plans for “Suicide Squad.” Entertainment Weekly will host Con-X[http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/08/con-x], a fan zone with a stage for D.J. sets and Q. and A.s with celebrities.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Addressing cybersecurity in cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, auto industry executives and government officials will descend on Detroit to discuss the rising concerns of cybersecurity and hacking. Automobiles have essentially become supercomputers on wheels, and more of them are linked to the internet, posing security risks. (A year ago, researchers showed[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/security-researchers-find-a-way-to-hack-cars/] that they were able to remotely take control of a Jeep Grand Cherokee as it rolled down a highway.) The gathering, called the Billington Automotive Cybersecurity Summit[http://www.billingtoncybersecurity.com/global-automotive-cybersecurity-summit/], is intended to highlight what car companies and policy makers can do to meet the challenge. Speakers include Mary T.

</div><div class="author">By MICHELLE HIGGINS </div><div>1167 words</div><div>13 July 2016</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>15</div><div>English</div><div>© 2016 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City’s ultraluxury real estate frenzy — with its sky-piercing condominium towers and $100 million price tags — has finally come to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with every conceivable amenity, the eight- and nine-digit prices attached to trophy homes with helicopter views and high-end finishes never bore much relation to actual value. Rather, a class of superrich investors primarily drove the market, choosing high-priced real estate as their asset of choice, because it was less volatile than other investments and they could use shell companies to hide their identities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But today, a four-year construction boom aimed at buyers willing to spend $10 million or more has flooded the top of the market just as global market turmoil has caused wealthy investors to pull back and the United States government has moved to scrutinize some all-cash transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s not just the volatility of financial markets that has big spenders sitting on their wallets. Other global trends that have put the lid on high-end spending include China’s tightened restrictions on capital outflows, uncertainty surrounding Britain’s decision to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, lower oil prices curbing wealth in the Middle East, and tax increases and other measures that have driven up property transaction costs in some countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the volume of sales at the uppermost level has dwindled, some sellers have made drastic price cuts and some projects have been delayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers of the skyscraper planned for 111 West 57th Street in Manhattan said they would postpone marketing materials and events for condominiums in the building, some priced as high as $57 million, until next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 432 Park Avenue, also in Manhattan, the tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere, full-floor apartments originally listed for $78 million to $85 million have been split in two and priced at approximately $40 million each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In and around West 57th Street, known as Billionaires’ Row, ‘‘it’s not just slow — it’s come to a complete halt,’’ said Dolly Lenz, a real estate broker to the superrich. She attributed the lack of activity along the corridor to oversupply, little differentiation among glassy ultraluxury units and peak pricing. ‘‘That’s a death knell,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York is not alone. After the global financial crisis hit in 2008, investors turned to high-end real estate around the world as a safe place to park their millions. But since the middle of 2014, prime property values have dropped in Paris; Singapore; London; Moscow; and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, said Yolande Barnes, the director of world research at Savills, a global real estate firm. ‘‘These cities have acted as a store of wealth,’’ said Ms. Barnes, who sees the current decline in values as ‘‘an inevitable setback that you get after a long bull run.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the market still has a long way to go before fire-sale pricing sets in, the declines may indicate that a ceiling has been reached. And even as sales over $10 million drop off in Manhattan, the bulk of the market remains robust, with competition particularly heated for homes priced at less than $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first half of the year, contracts signed for Manhattan residences costing $10 million or more dropped about 18 percent, to 107 units, down from 130 a year earlier, according to data compiled by Olshan Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Miami area, 216 homes and condos priced at $10 million were on the market at the end of June, a 43 percent jump from a year earlier, according to data compiled by <span class="companylink">Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors</span>. ‘‘By anyone’s measurement, that’s more than you’d like to have,’’ said Ron Shuffield, the president of that firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The global misperception was that the demand would be endless,’’ said Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraisal firm. ‘‘The reality was the market was not as deep as what was thought.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As supply has overtaken demand, prices of luxury properties have fallen. After a year on the market, the $45 million triplex penthouse at 10 Sullivan Street in Manhattan, developed by Madison Equities and Property Markets Group, was divided into two units, now listed for $11.5 million and $28.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sellers are even showing a willingness to take a loss. At One57, on West 57th Street, the tower credited with starting the boom in skyscrapers aimed at the extremely wealthy, four apartments up for resale are priced at less than the seller paid, including a three-bedroom listed for $27.95 million that sold for $31.67 million in 2014, according to Streeteasy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Extell Development Company</span>, which is still selling units at One57 four years after beginning sales, reduced the projected sellout value of the tower to $2.56 billion in March, a markdown of $162 million from its 2013 projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers who cling to their original asking prices are either rejiggering their product or casting a wider net to reach buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find buyers for Le Palais Royal, a $159 million mansion in Hillsboro Beach, Fla., that has $7 million worth of 22-karat gold leaf and a 27-foot waterfall, Joseph Leone, the developer, has flown to London, Los Angeles, Dubai and Singapore to put together a team of brokers to sell the property rather than hiring just one firm. ‘‘I believe clients are looking for something unique,’’ Mr. Leone said. ‘‘They are still here, but you need to change your strategy. You need to be creative.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices at the high end continue to set records, that’s largely because many of the deals that are closing now involve contracts that were signed as long as 18 months ago, when many of the buildings were still under construction and the market was stronger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers insist that sales at the top are continuing, just at a slower pace than in recent years. ‘‘There is still very good activity,’’ said Gary Barnett, the president of Extell, ‘‘but it’s hard to close deals because people are not in a rush.’’ To help attract buyers to an unsold $20.1 million, three-bedroom apartment on the 45th floor of One57, Extell hired the designer Jennifer Post to decorate it at an estimated cost of $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Unless you give them a real imperative to buy,’’ Mr. Barnett said, ‘‘they think, ‘I can come back in a month and it will still be there, or maybe the price will be lower.’ That’s why we’re doing these things, to get these deals closed.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller of Miller Samuel was less optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘It takes a while for sellers, whether in new development or resales, to capitulate to sudden changes in the market,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s not that there aren’t any buyers at this level. It’s that there aren’t buyers willing to pay 2014 prices.’’</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STANDARD LIFE FUND HALTS WITHDRAWALS A sense of caution returned to financial markets as Asian stocks dropped for the first time in a week and haven assets rose, Bloomberg reports[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-04/asian-stock-outlook-clouded-with-silver-in-demand-as-crude-falls?nl=dealbook&amp;emc=edit_dlbkam_20160705].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks had climbed last week as it became less likely that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> would raise interest rates in the United States and more likely that central banks would add to monetary stimulus in Europe and Japan. Now Italy is considering using state funds to recapitalize its banking system, giving investors more reason to be cautious in the wake of Britain’s vote to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor wariness also prompted <span class="companylink">Standard Life Investments</span> – the mutual fund arm of a British insurance company, with large investments in London commercial real estate – to suspend requests from investors wanting to exit the $3 billion fund, Landon Thomas Jr. reports in DealBook[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/05/business/dealbook/standard-life-fund-halts-withdrawals-after-brexit-vote.html?ref=dealbook&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;emc=edit_dlbkam_20160705]. The firm said there had been an “increase in redemption requests as a result of uncertainty for the U.K. commercial real estate market following the E.U. referendum result” and that it would end the suspension “as soon as practicable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standard Life had reduced the value of its commercial property investments along with other fund managers last week by 3 percent to 5 percent. Its U.K. Real Estate Fund invests in high-end commercial properties in London, which have soared in value. But the decision by a majority of British voters to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> has raised questions about London’s future as a financial and commercial hub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move caused jitters among traders who were already worried about mutual funds investing in assets that are hard to buy and sell. Mutual funds in Britain that invest in London property markets have been particularly popular as aggressive central bank policies pushed interest rates to zero. Many of them are in effect big bets on London malls, office towers and elite residential developments. But these properties can be hard to sell in a down market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks slid for a second day on Tuesday with shares in Britain’s property sector slumping after Standard Life’s decision, as The Financial Times reports[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b17b4250-427f-11e6-9b66-0712b3873ae1.html?nl=dealbook&amp;emc=edit_dlbkam_20160705#axzz4DOzVEDgU]. Britain’s largest property company, <span class="companylink">Land Securities</span>, fell about 4.6 percent on Tuesday morning. As confidence crumbled, the pound tumbled [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-05/pound-drops-toward-31-year-low-as-selloff-resumes-before-carney?nl=dealbook&amp;emc=edit_dlbkam_20160705]to a 31-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUMMER READING LIST: TELL-ALLS AND CAUTIONARY TALES IN FINANCE Andrew Ross Sorkin[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/05/business/dealbook/a-reading-list-of-tell-alls-strategic-plans-and-cautionary-tales-in-finance.html?ref=dealbook&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;emc=edit_dlbkam_20160705] has plowed through stacks of books to find the best reads on business, finance and technology for you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley,” by a former <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> executive, is the most fun business book Mr. Sorkin has read this year. The story is a tell-all of Antonio García Martinez’s experience in venture capital and at <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, filled with insights into what he calls “the tech whorehouse” of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mohamed A. El-Erian’s “The Only Game in Town: Central Banks, Instability, and Avoiding the Next Collapse” explains the power and limits of central banks, and how interconnected our economies are, while “Makers and Takers: The Rise of Finance and the Fall of American Business,” by the journalist Rana Foroohar, is a well-told exploration of why the economy is leaving too many behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For something a little more introspective, Adam Grant, the youngest-ever tenured full professor at the <span class="companylink">Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania</span>, examines what it takes to be a Steve-Jobs-like success in “Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World.” It turns out procrastination is a great thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deal junkies will devour “Bloodsport: When Ruthless Dealmakers, Shrewd Ideologues, and Brawling Lawyers Toppled the Corporate Establishment,” by Robert Teitelman, the founding editor of The Deal. It tells the story of our modern mergers and acquisitions economy and has captured how power shifted from the boardroom to its shareholders. They can follow up with “Dear Chairman: Boardroom Battles and the Rise of Shareholder Activism,” in which Jeff Gramm, the owner and manager of the Bandera Partners hedge fund and an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, has collected letters sent by investors to chief executives. They are eye-opening, often chilling and include fascinating lessons about business, Mr. Sorkin writes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want to do some reading before the Olympics in Rio, pick up “Brazillionaires: Wealth, Power, Decadence, and Hope in an American Country.” The journalist Alex Cuadros charts Brazil’s economic rise and fall through some of the biggest, most colorful characters in business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those interested in the former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan will have to wait until October, when a biography written by the journalist Sebastian Mallaby will be published. Mr. Mallaby ventured beyond the narrative of him as a genius who was later blamed for the financial crisis to examine the complicated mind of a man who may have had one of the largest ever influences over the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want to put a smile on your face, pick up “To <span class="companylink">Pixar</span> and Beyond: My Unlikely Journey with Steve Jobs to Make Entertainment History,” by Lawrence Levy, the digital animation studio’s former chief financial officer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRITISH COURT CONVICTS FORMER BARCLAYS EMPLOYEES OVER LIBOR RIGGING Three former employees of <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> have been convicted of plotting to improve the bank’s trading results by “dishonestly rigging” the benchmark interest rate known as Libor, Chad Bray reports in Dealbook.[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/05/business/dealbook/barclays-libor-britain-trial.html?ref=dealbook&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;emc=edit_dlbkam_20160705]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trial comes after a half-decade investigation into the London interbank offered rate that led to billions of dollars in fines and shook the reputations of some of the world’s biggest banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The setting of Libor and other rates involves banks submitting the rates at which they would be prepared to lend money to one another. Libor is used to price more than $300 trillion in securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Serious Fraud Office of Britain</span> had claimed that a group of <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> derivative traders in New York and London conspired with rate submitters in London to manipulate the benchmark interest rate. The aim was to increase the traders’ profits from interest rate swaps and other derivative contracts with so-called counterparties, which could include other banks, governments and pension funds, prosecutors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two former Barclays traders, Jay Vijay Merchant and Alex Pabon, as well as Jonathan J. Mathew, a former rate submitter at the bank, were each convicted on a charge of conspiracy to defraud. Sentencing is expected later this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jury, which began its deliberations on June 20, was unable to reach a verdict regarding two other former <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> employees, the former traders Stylianos Contogoulas and Ryan Michael Reich. The convictions were delivered on Wednesday, but reporting was restricted until after the jury had concluded its deliberations on all five defendants. The Serious Fraud Office will now have two weeks to decide whether to pursue a retrial of the Mr. Contogoulas and Mr. Reich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British prosecutors have had mixed results in their efforts to pursue criminal charges over Libor. Tom Hayes, a former trader at UBS and Citigroup, is serving 11 years in prison, but prosecutors hit a stumbling block in January, when six former brokers were acquitted of criminal charges that they helped Mr. Hayes manipulate Libor.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small city of Boulder, home to the <span class="companylink">University of Colorado</span>’s flagship campus, has a booming local economy and a pleasantly compact downtown with mountain views. Not surprisingly, a lot of people want to move here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something else is also not surprising: Many of the people who already live in Boulder would prefer that the newcomers settle somewhere else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The quality of the experience of being in Boulder, part of it has to do with being able to go to this meadow and it isn’t just littered with human beings,’’ said Steve Pomerance, a former city councilman who moved here from Connecticut in the 1960s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of Boulder’s charms are under threat, Mr. Pomerance said. Rush-hour traffic has become horrendous. Quaint, two-story storefronts are being dwarfed by glass and steel. Cars park along the road to the meadow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, you can find a Steve Pomerance in cities across the country — people who moved somewhere before it exploded and now worry that growth is killing the place they love.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a growing body of economic literature suggests that anti-growth sentiment, when multiplied across countless unheralded local development battles, is a major factor in creating a stagnant and less equal American economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has even to some extent changed how Americans of different incomes view opportunity. Unlike past decades, when people of different socioeconomic backgrounds tended to move to similar areas, today, less-skilled workers often go where jobs are scarcer but housing is cheap, instead of heading to places with the most promising job opportunities, according to research by Daniel Shoag, a professor of public policy at Harvard, and Peter Ganong, also of Harvard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason they’re not migrating to places with better job prospects is that rich cities like San Francisco and Seattle have gotten so expensive that working-class people cannot afford to move there. Even if they could, whatever they gained in pay would be swallowed up by rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Boulder, for instance, the median home price has risen 60 percent over the last five years, to $648,200. Today, someone who makes the typical Boulder salary would have to put about 40 percent of monthly income toward payments on a new mortgage or about half toward rent, according to Zillow, a real estate website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘We’ve switched from a world where everybody educated and uneducated was moving from poorer parts of the country to the richer parts of the country,’’ said Professor Shoag, ‘‘to a world where the higher-educated people move to San Francisco and lower educated people move to Vegas.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zoning restrictions have been around for decades but really took off during the 1960s, when the combination of inner-city race riots and ‘‘white flight’’ from cities led to heavily zoned suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have gotten more restrictive over time, contributing to a jump in home prices that has been a bonanza for anyone who bought early in places like Boulder, San Francisco and New York City. But for latecomers, the costs have become prohibitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, a group of politicians, including Gov. Jerry Brown of California and President Obama, is joining with developers in trying to get cities to streamline many of the local zoning laws that, they say, make homes more expensive and hold too many newcomers at bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To most people, zoning and land-use regulations might conjure up little more than images of City Council meetings full of minutiae. But these laws go a long way toward determining some fundamental aspects of life: what American neighborhoods look like, who gets to live where and what schools their children attend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when zoning laws get out of hand, economists say, the damage to the American economy and society can be profound. Studies have shown that laws aimed at things like ‘‘maintaining neighborhood character’’ or limiting how many unrelated people can live together in the same house contribute to racial segregation and deeper class disparities. They also exacerbate inequality by restricting the housing supply in places where demand is greatest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lost opportunities for development may theoretically reduce the output of the United States economy by as much as $1.5 trillion a year, according to estimates in a recent paper by the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti. Regardless of the actual gains in dollars that could be achieved if zoning laws were significantly cut back, the research on land-use restrictions highlights some of the consequences of giving local communities too much control over who is allowed to live there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘You don’t want rules made entirely for people that have something, at the expense of people who don’t,’’ said Jason Furman, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the biggest solution offered comes out of California, where Mr. Brown has proposed a law to speed up housing development by making it harder for cities to saddle developers with open-ended design, permit and environmental reviews. The Massachusetts State Senate passed similar measures. And President Obama has proposed $300 million in grants to prod local governments to simplify their building regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brown’s proposal has inflamed local politicians, environmentalists and community groups, who see it as state overreach into how they regulate development. But it has drawn broad support from developers, not surprisingly, as well as a number of business leaders, including many from the technology industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand how a bunch of little-growth laws make their way into existence, consider how well Boulder is doing — and why it has made people wary of promoting local growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city, about a 45-minute drive from Denver, is surrounded by postcard views of the Rockies. It has the charms of a resort town with the bonus that, unlike a resort town, it has more than ski lift and bartending jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is a virtuous economic cycle in which the university churns out smart people, the smart people attract employers, and the amenities make everyone want to stay. <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> is expanding its offices. A few miles away, a new <span class="companylink">Google</span> campus is under construction that will allow the company to expand its Boulder work force to 1,500 from 400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking to slow the pace of development, last year a citizens’ group called Livable Boulder — Mr. Pomerance was involved in the effort — pushed a pair of local ballot measures that would have increased fees on new development and given neighborhood groups a vote on zoning changes in their area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Toor, Boulder’s former mayor, who worked for the ‘‘no’’ campaign, said, ‘‘You would never build affordable housing, you would never build community facilities like homeless shelters — those things would just never happen if you had all veto power at the neighborhood level.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voters shot the measures down, but development is almost certain to remain the city’s most contentious issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘We don’t need one more job in Boulder,’’ Mr. Pomerance said. ‘‘We don’t need to grow anymore. Go somewhere else where they need you.’’</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan apartment prices continued to hover at or near record highs in the second quarter of 2016, but there are signs that the market may finally be turning more favorable for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales reports to be released on Friday by major real estate firms show some signs that the market is cooling off, with sales volume dropping, fewer bidding wars and more listings hitting the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of closed sales fell 14 percent to 3,434 in the second quarter, compared with the same period last year, according to a report by <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. Contracts signed were down even more for the same period, with 3,287 deals made in the second quarter, a 20 percent drop compared with a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing the market reset,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and the author of a report by <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, which showed the number of resale apartment closings down 9.4 percent to 2,231 in the second quarter compared with a year ago. ''We're exiting the period of euphoria the market experienced for the last several years and entering a market that is closer to long-term historical trends.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartments that sold at or above list price made up 41.3 percent of the market in the second quarter, the lowest share of sales in more than two years, according to Mr. Miller. Just 16.1 percent of those sales were above list price compared with a high of 31 percent in the third quarter of last year, indicating a drop in bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think you're seeing a leveling out,'' said Dottie Herman, chief executive of Douglas Elliman Real Estate. ''As opposed to a buyer's or seller's market,'' she said, ''the playing field is even.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers attributed the slowdown to buyer hesitation brought on by turmoil in the financial markets and a disconnect between what sellers hope to gain and what buyers want to pay. ''Sellers want last year's prices and buyers want next year's prices,'' said Richard Grossman, the president of <span class="companylink">Halstead Property</span>, which reported that the median price of a Manhattan apartment rose 13 percent to $1.11 million from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surge of new development closings pushed the average new development price to a record $3.78 million, up 28 percent in the second quarter compared with a year ago, according to Halstead. The rise in prices was driven by deals that were penned as long as two years ago but closed only in the last few months, as the buildings neared completion. ''They were purchased years ago and reflect a different market than today,'' Mr. Grossman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the average resale price slipped 4 percent from a year ago to $1.5 million, according to Halstead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High housing prices have been coercing more people to sell, easing the inventory crunch that kept sellers in the driver's seat. After hitting bottom at the end of 2013, the number of apartments brought to market has been on the rise, with 6,352 listings in the second quarter, up 10.9 percent compared with the same period a year ago, according to <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. The rise in inventory levels was buoyed by an increase in listings outside the new development market. Resales jumped 25 percent to 5,362 listings in the second quarter compared with a year ago -- the biggest annual increase since the first quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're coming from a market where there was no inventory,'' Ms. Herman, of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, said. ''If there is more inventory, people have more choices. If they have more choices, you have to be more competitive in pricing.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Economic growth in the United States slowed in the first quarter but not as sharply as previously estimated, with gains in exports and software investment partly offsetting weak consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross domestic product increased at a 1.1 percent annual rate, rather than the 0.8 percent pace reported last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday, in its final estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-quarter G.D.P. growth has been revised higher by 0.6 percentage point since the first estimate was published in April. The economy grew at a rate of 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter. The first-quarter revision was broadly in line with economists' expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs the economy has regained momentum in the second quarter, with retail sales and home sales rising in April and May, even though business spending continues to struggle and job growth has slowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But uncertainty stoked by Britain's surprising vote to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> poses a risk to growth for the rest of year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, told lawmakers last week that data pointed to ''a noticeable step-up'' in G.D.P. growth in the second quarter. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta</span> is estimating that second-quarter G.D.P. will rise at a 2.6 percent rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic growth in the first quarter was constrained by a strong dollar and sluggish global demand. Output was also hampered by businesses' efforts to reduce an inventory overhang, with a further drag coming from lower oil prices, which have set off deep spending cuts on capital goods like equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists also say they think the model used by the government to strip out seasonal patterns from data is not fully accomplishing its goal. The economy has underperformed in the first quarter in five of the last six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-quarter business spending on software, research and development was revised to show it rising at a 4.4 percent rate instead of falling at a 0.1 percent rate. Business spending on equipment fell at an 8.7 percent pace as opposed to the 9 percent rate reported last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, business spending sliced off 0.58 percentage point from first-quarter G.D.P. instead of the previously reported 0.81 percentage point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Export growth was revised to show a 0.3 percent rate of increase instead of the previously reported 2 percent pace of contraction. With imports weak, that resulted in a smaller trade deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity in the United States, was revised down to a 1.5 percent rate, the slowest pace in two years. Consumer spending was previously reported to have increased at a 1.9 percent rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downward revision reflected weak spending on services like transportation and recreation. But April and May retail sales reports suggest that consumer spending has rebounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Tuesday, a report from the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> showed that consumer confidence increased to an eight-month high in June. The survey was, however, conducted before last week's referendum in Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Near-term market volatility may give households reason for pause, but consumer spending should remain a key support for the economy in the coming quarters,'' said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Mich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, data released on Tuesday showed that house prices rose 5.4 percent in April from a year ago.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes in the United States rose in May to a nine-year high as improving supply increased choices for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Wednesday that sales increased 1.8 percent last month to an annual rate of 5.53 million units, the highest level since February 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The economy can't be going too far off course when home buying is picking up,'' said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales pace in April was revised down to 5.43 million units from the previously reported 5.45 million units. Sales were up 4.5 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong home resales added to retail sales data in painting an upbeat picture of the economy. That should help allay the fears that were stoked by last month's paltry job gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher existing-home sales suggest an increase in brokers' commissions, which should bolster the residential investment portion of the gross domestic product report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is being driven by an increase in the formation of households as some young adults find employment and older Americans move into smaller and cheaper homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales surged 4.1 percent in the Northeast and rose 4.6 percent in the South. Sales in the West, where house prices have increased sharply because inventory is tight, jumped 5.4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Midwest, sales tumbled 6.5 percent last month. The decline, however, came after recent hefty gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of unsold homes on the market in May rose 1.4 percent from April to 2.15 million units. Supply, however, was down 5.7 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, new listings typically stayed on the market for 32 days, the shortest period since the association started tracking the data. In April, it was 39 days, and a year ago, it was 40 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At May's sales pace,clearing the stock of houses on the market would take 4.7 months, unchanged from April. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say builders will need to increase the construction of homes to meet the pent-up demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With inventory still tight, the median house price rose 4.7 percent from a year ago to a high of $239,700 last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in house prices is outstripping wage gains. While that could make buying a home expensive for first-time buyers, it is increasing equity for homeowners and enticing some to put their homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the share of first-time buyers fell to 30 percent from 32 percent in both April and a year ago.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices set off fears that real estate will become even more expensive, making it impossible ever to buy a home in a given city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s easy to understand how such worries spread, but the historical record suggests that these fears are generally exaggerated. Cities with steep price increases today will probably have much smaller upticks in the future. And for the most part, differences in price increases among cities are well explained by short-term variations in employment growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider some recent trends. In the year ended in March, cities like Denver, Seattle and Portland, Ore., had employment growth of more than 3 percent, according to the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>, along with double-digit home price increases, according to the S.&amp;P./Case-Shiller indexes. At the same time, employment growth has been relatively tepid in cities like Boston, Cleveland and New York, and so have home price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not rocket science. When businesses in a city have an unusually successful year and hire a lot more people, new employees arrive, but initially there aren’t enough homes for them. Home prices rise immediately so that demand effectively equals the existing supply, inevitably causing ripple effects. Someone with a new, high-paying job will outbid someone else, who will have to lower her sights and accept a less attractive house. People much further down the ladder will end up living with their parents or with roommates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a national scale, this suggests that weak employment growth of the kind shown in May’s jobs report, with only a 38,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls, could eventually hurt home prices across the country. That’s possible. But even without a national price slowdown or decline, there is reason to believe that double-digit increases won’t continue for long in individual cities. Short-term variations abound, but for the most part, the differences in long-term home price increases in individual cities are about plus or minus one percentage point annually. (Exceptions include San Francisco and Portland, whose home prices have grown almost two percentage points above average annually since 1987.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities with big home price increases recently have issued more building permits per capita. This supply response has the potential to reverse at least some of the prices: When housing supply increases, it tends to bring high real estate prices down, though that takes time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is another wrinkle, however. Demand lately has tilted toward homes in central cities, where land is scarce, rather than in more spacious distant suburbs. This creates imbalances. New homes in the suburbs have often remained unsold for long intervals. Construction of apartment buildings has increased in cities since the financial crisis, but new arrivals with good jobs often haven’t wanted to live in apartments. This may explain 2016 data showing that permits for new buildings with five or more units have flagged. Despite these problems, the supply response to higher home prices should moderate or reverse some of the biggest increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet many people assume that home prices will rise ever upward. These expectations are more modest than in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, but they are substantial. The January 2016 Pulsenomics U.S. Housing Confidence Survey showed that expectations for home price increases over the next 10 years averaged 3.7 percent a year nationally, which implies a 44 percent total increase by 2026. Expectations were a little higher for homeowners than renters and higher yet for recent buyers — which appears to reflect a wishful-thinking bias. They were highest for recent buyers in high-price-increase cities, peaking at almost 6.5 percent a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, however, investing in homes just hasn’t rewarded most homeowners that much. As I have calculated, home prices corrected for Consumer Price Index inflation nationally were nearly flat for the century ending in 1990. And when nominal home prices are deflated by per capita disposable personal income, it turns out that real prices of existing homes fell 12 percent while real prices of newly built homes fell 30 percent from 1975 to 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As their disposable income has grown relative to home prices, individuals have bought more housing. That’s partly why average household size declined to 2.5 people in 2015 from 2.9 in 1975. The percent of households consisting of a single person rose to 28 percent in 2015 from 20 percent in 1975. There are other explanations for this, but one is certainly that housing has been getting cheaper, relative to income, so we are consuming much more of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes are larger: Median floor space has risen to 2,169 square feet in 2010 from 1,525 in 1973, census data shows. This large increase generally holds within major metropolitan areas and outside them. While living space is constrained in the heart of large, high-priced cities like New York, builders elsewhere have usually been able to accommodate people’s demands for cheap large homes roughly where they want them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given these facts, why do people still worry that home prices are getting out of reach? The answer can’t be found in the housing data. Instead, these fears may reflect anxieties about other issues — like income inequality, globalization and the threat of job losses because of robots and artificial intelligence. In prosperous cities, rising prices may connote economic exclusion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, American society is increasingly divided according to educational attainment and income. In some circles, rarefied home prices may set off worries about being unable to live in choice locations shared with successful people. Home prices may, unfortunately, be viewed as a measurement of success in life rather than merely of floor space, and fear of being priced out of housing may well be rooted in deeper broodings about maintaining a position in the social hierarchy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A CONTEMPORARY APARTMENT IN MEXICO CITY FACING CHAPULTEPEC PARK</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$2.875 MILLION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This five-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath apartment, in a high-rise 1997 development named Del Bosque designed by Cesar Pelli, is in Polanco, one of Mexico City’s most exclusive neighborhoods. It sits across from Chapultepec Park and two blocks from Avenida Presidente Masaryk, known as Mexico City’s Rodeo Drive, said Vivian Bardavid, a Mexico City-based agent with Guadalajara Sotheby’s International Realty, which has the listing. Between five and 20 minutes’ walking distance are museums and other cultural sites, restaurants, hotels and embassies. The international airport is about 10 miles away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment, which is about 5,480 square feet, is one of two on the fourth floor. Past the front door and a small foyer, a hallway leads to three bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, an office and a half-bath. The master suite, in the left corner, has a large bathroom with a glass-enclosed shower and a double sink, and a deep walk-in closet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down the main hallway in the opposite direction from the bedrooms, the living room, family room and dining room are in the center of the apartment. Most of the flooring is hardwood imported from Norway, Ms. Bardavid said. The custom-designed furniture throughout the apartment is available through separate negotiation, she said. The art is not for sale. The family room, tucked next to the living room, can be separated with sliding doors from the rest of the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the right side of the apartment are the kitchen, two staff bedrooms, a staff bathroom and laundry facilities. The kitchen appliances are by Wolf. The apartment has air-conditioning and ample storage, in the form of multiple closets in the main hallway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building’s amenities, including a tennis court, an indoor pool, a children’s play area, valet parking and a gym, are included in the monthly fee. The fee also covers security, concierge service and maintenance. Residents can use a heliport and party and meeting rooms for a fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKET OVERVIEW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mexico City’s real estate market is performing very strongly this year, agents said. There are many new developments, and prices across the board have increased. This is partly because of a strengthening Mexican economy, and partly because sellers have adjusted to a new tax on capital gains that temporarily made them hesitant to put their homes on the market, agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carmella Peters Romero, an owner and broker at Peters &amp; Romero Bienes Raices, an agency in Mexico City, said owners typically will not sell unless they get an offer very close to their asking price. Homes tend to stay on the market around six months, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volatility of the peso, which has lost about 35 percent against the dollar since 2011 and around 16 percent against the dollar since last June, had an effect on the real estate market last year, with lowered rents and more negotiation on sales, Ms. Peters Romero said. But prices are now rising, as they have yearly for the last six years, since she began working in this market, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Polanco are around $5,000 per square meter, or around $465 a square foot, compared with around $4,000 a square meter, or around $372 a square foot, last year, Ms. Peters Romero said. For the most expensive properties in the city, prices can reach $11,000 per square meter, or around $1,023 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen Boda, an owner of URP Properties, a boutique real estate brokerage in Mexico City, estimated that prices have risen at least 10 percent for both residential properties and offices since January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Polanco, luxury apartments cost $2.5 million to $10 million, she said. In nearby Lomas de Chapultepec, an area with older, traditional homes, the better luxury properties begin at $3 million, she said. People there tend to tear down homes and rebuild. Less expensive luxury homes are available at Bosque de las Lomas, just to the west, where quality homes are available for $800,000 and the top prices run around $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city’s most expensive homes are priced at $10 million to $15 million, Ms. Boda said. They tend to be in Lomas de Chapultepec in the north and in El Pedregal and Coyoacán in the south. Location, finishes, whether or not a property has a garden, and whether or not it’s on a more desirable gated or restricted street affect prices, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Boda also noted two trends. One is that people are increasingly choosing to live near their jobs because of the city’s traffic. Second, because there’s no room to develop in certain desirable neighborhoods, new areas are becoming trendy, including Colonia Roma, west of the city center, and New Polanco, next to Polanco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transactions can be done in dollars or pesos, but the deed must be recorded in pesos, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO BUYS IN MEXICO CITY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Boda said most buyers of luxury properties are Mexican. Foreigners who move to the city for work tend to stay in rentals. But Ms. Boda has worked with buyers from the United States, France[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/europe/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], Italy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/europe/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Spain[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/europe/index.html?inline=nyt-geo].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both in Mexico City and throughout the country, it is becoming more common for people to buy homes as investments or as vacation properties, Ms. Peters Romero said. Usually, those people purchase smaller condos, starting at 150 square meters, or about 1,600 square feet, in high-end areas of the city, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYING BASICS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only Mexican citizens can buy land without restriction in Mexico, said Jonathan Pikoff, the founder of Pikoff Attorneys, which specializes in real estate and has offices in Mexico and the United States. If a foreigner buys residential property within 50 kilometers, or 31 miles, from the coastline or 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, from the border, it must be done by using an existing trust through a Mexican bank or creating one, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transactions are handled by notaries. Mr. Pikoff recommended that foreign buyers also hire a lawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closing costs, which are paid exclusively by the seller, include the notary fee, a 16 percent value-added tax[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/v/valueadded_tax/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] on the notary fee, an appraisal, a zoning certificate and a land transfer tax. For a $1 million property, those taxes and fees add up to approximately $57,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking for a vacation rental in the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span> this summer? From the manicured hedgerows of Southampton to the wind-swept dunes of Montauk, real estate agents say, it's a renter's market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to greater inventory and a trend toward shorter bookings, many prime rental homes are still available, and owners are willing to negotiate. While advertised discounts have yet to emerge, deals are for the taking for renters who ask, agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our advice to owners whose home has not yet rented is to forget what you wanted for the house,'' said Anthony DeVivio, the managing director of <span class="companylink">Halstead Property</span> in the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span>. Instead, consider, ''What do you need to carry the house for the year?'' he said. ''Be prepared to take that number. If you're asking for more at this point, you're probably overpriced.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A house with three bedrooms, three baths and a pool in the Northwest Woods section of East Hampton, originally listed by Mr. DeVivio for $28,000 for the month of August, recently rented for $19,000. That's a 32 percent discount. Some of the best deals can be found at the ultrahigh end, Mr. DeVivio added, noting that he recently negotiated a last-minute house rental off Further Lane in East Hampton for June and July ''for a very, very good price.'' Further Lane is one of the most desirable addresses in the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span>, lined with oceanfront estates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term deal, of course, is relative in the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span>, where the cost of a rental house for the month of August can range from $30,000 to $300,000. And prime waterfront properties and houses within walking distance of shops and restaurants tend to offer less wiggle room on price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A combination of factors is contributing to the rental slowdown, according to real estate agents across the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span>, who say the volume of seasonal rentals is down 30 percent to 50 percent compared with this time last year. The buying boom over the last couple of years has flooded the market with new inventory, as many of the recent buyers have no plans to use the house all summer long. At the same time, more families are coming out for one-month or weeklong increments instead of renting a house for the entire summer. And some owners have simply overreached, setting unrealistic prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exacerbating the issue in the Town of East Hampton, which includes the hamlets of Wainscott, Springs, Amagansett and Montauk, is a rental registry implemented this season to help crack down on overcrowding and share houses. The registry requires owners to display their rental registry number on listings and any advertising. So far more than 2,400 residential properties have been registered, according to the town. Brokers say others are available but are simply not being advertised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of properties that aren't being publicly marketed,'' said Rylan Jacka, an associate broker at Sotheby's International Realty. Some are just entering the market now, as owners scramble to comply with the new ordinance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, many places that normally would be booked by now are still up for grabs. Among the listings still available from <span class="companylink">Town &amp; Country Real Estate</span>: a house with five bedrooms and three and a half baths overlooking Hither Hills beach in Montauk for $50,000 for July; a newly built five-bedroom in Amagansett with an outdoor kitchen and a heated saltwater pool, $115,000 for August; and a six-bedroom English manor on two acres with a heated pool in the estate section of East Hampton Village, $200,000 now through Labor Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But don't wait too much longer if you are planning on a hammock in the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span>. ''Now that temps are finally hitting 80, tenants who have been waiting on the sidelines will come rushing out,'' said Judi A. Desiderio, the chief executive of Town &amp; Country, with offices throughout the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span>. ''And frankly, they will get some great rentals at some great prices.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Consumer spending surged in April, led by a big jump in purchases of autos and other durable goods, while home prices kept climbing in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending rose 1 percent in April after a flat reading in March, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday[http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/pi/pinewsrelease.htm]. Incomes were up a solid 0.4 percent, matching the gain in March. Wages and salaries, the most important component of incomes, rose 0.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong showing for consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, signals that the economy is performing notably better this quarter after nearly stalling out at the start of the year. Many economists say the economy is growing at a 2.5 percent rate, outpacing a 0.8 percent gain in the first quarter[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/28/business/economy/us-economy-gdp-q1-growth-revision.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“American shoppers came racing back to the malls, auto shops and online stores in April,” said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The April spending figure was the biggest one-month climb since a 1.3 percent increase in August 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> reported Tuesday[https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm] that its May confidence index fell to a reading of 92.6 from 94.7 in April. This stood in contrast to the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>’s consumer sentiment survey, which rose in May to its highest reading in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said that given the surge in consumer spending seen in April, they thought the Michigan survey was a more accurate reflection of how consumers were feeling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All major spending components showed solid gains in April, led by a 2.3 percent surge in spending on durable goods like autos. Spending on nondurable goods, like clothing and food, expanded a solid 1.4 percent, while spending on services such as rent payments and utility bills increased 0.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, said Friday that an increase in a crucial Fed interest rate would be appropriate[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/28/business/yellen-says-fed-on-track-to-raise-rates-in-coming-months.html] in coming months if the economy keeps improving and inflation keeps moving toward the Fed’s 2 percent goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report showed that the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index increased 5.4 percent in March[https://www.spice-indices.com/idpfiles/spice-assets/resources/public/documents/353544_cshomeprice-release-0531.pdf?force_download=true] compared with the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solid job growth, modest increases in wages and salaries, and low mortgage rates are feeding Americans’ willingness to buy homes. Yet there is also a limited supply of homes on the market, which pushes up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of available homes fell 3.6 percent in April, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It remains a tough home buying season for buyers, with little inventory available among lower-priced homes,” said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at the real estate data firm Zillow. “The competition is locking out some first-time buyers, who instead are paying record-high rents.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, sales of existing homes rose 1.7 percent in April, the second consecutive increase, to an annual rate of 5.45 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portland, Seattle and Denver had the highest yearly gains. Prices rose 12.3 percent in Portland, 10.8 percent in Seattle and 10 percent in Denver. All three cities have rapidly growing technology industries and strong job gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose in all 20 cities, but at a slower pace in the Northeast and Midwest. The cities with the smallest year-over-year increases were Washington, Chicago, New York and Cleveland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A revived housing market is helping feed faster economic growth. Sales of new homes rose to their highest level in eight years in April, and home construction has also increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates remain at historical lows: A 30-year fixed rate mortgage averaged just 3.64 percent last week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the latest symbols of the overinflated luxury housing market is a pink mansion perched above the Mediterranean on the French Riviera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 13,000-square-foot property, built and owned by the fashion magnate Pierre Cardin, is composed of giant terra cotta orbs arranged in a sprawling hive. The home’s name befits its price. ‘‘Le Palais Bulles,’’ or ‘‘the Bubble Palace,’’ is being offered for sale at about $450 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing is part of a global pileup of homes listed for $100 million or more. A record 27 properties with nine-figure prices are officially for sale, according to <span class="companylink">Christie’s International Real Estate</span>. That is up from 19 last year and about a dozen in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you add in high-priced ‘‘whisper listings’’ that are offered privately, brokers say the actual number of nine-figure listings worldwide could easily top 40 or 50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘It’s a bumper crop,’’ said Dan Conn, the chief executive of Christie’s International Real Estate. ‘‘It’s just a new world in terms of what people are building and offering for sale.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in nine-figure real estate listings comes just as sales of luxury real estate have cooled. Many say the sudden surge in hyperprice homes — often built and sold by speculative investors — is the ultimate bubble signal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘When you have a record number of homes for sale at a price point of $100 million or more, that tells you these homes aren’t selling,’’ said Jonathan J. Miller, the president and chief executive of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraisal and research firm. ‘‘It’s not as deep a market as some might hope.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, only two homes in the world sold for over $100 million, according to <span class="companylink">Christie’s</span>. One was a 9,455-square-foot house in Hong Kong purchased for $193 million by Jack Ma, the executive chairman of Alibaba. The other was a townhouse in London that sold for $132 million. This year, a ranch in Texas went on the market for $700 million and a home in Dallas listed for $100 million. Both sold, but the actual sale prices have not been disclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, anyone can slap a $100 million price tag on a home to get attention. Yet actual sales of nine-figure homes are rare, even in good times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2011 to 2016, only 15 homes in the world have sold for $100 million or more, according to <span class="companylink">Christie’s</span>, and five of those were in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The era of aspirational pricing is over, and I’m not sure it ever really worked,’’ Mr. Miller said. ‘‘These prices get headlines, but the properties just don’t sell.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers promoting the listings say their properties are one-of-a-kind masterpieces — like Picassos or Modiglianis — that rarely come on the market. They add that the more than 1,800 billionaires in the world see property as a safer store of wealth than stocks or art. Mr. Conn estimates that of the 27 nine-figure listings, a third will sell for under $100 million, a third will sell for around $100 million and a third for far more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I don’t think it’s a sign of a bubble,’’ Mr. Conn said. ‘‘It’s a sign of growing wealth in the world and the quality of some of the new construction.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the market for megamansions and penthouses has cooled significantly in the last year. Prices for homes in the top 5 percent of the real estate market fell 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2016, according to Redfin. Prices for the rest of the housing market increased 4.7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say the very top of the market — consisting of eight- and nine-figure homes — is faring the worst as slowing economies around the globe and volatile stock markets have spooked buyers. The supply of homes for the rich exploded as builders aimed at the high end after the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 10 most expensive listings in the world, seven are in the United States and four of these are in Los Angeles. The most expensive listing in the world is the $500 million compound being built in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles by Nile Niami, a film producer and speculative builder. The property will have a 74,000-square-foot main house, a 30-car garage and a ‘‘Monaco-style casino.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In nearby Holmby Hills, a more modest 38,000-square-foot mansion, built by the investor and developer Gala Asher, came on the market in April for $150 million. The ultramodern house, on the prestigious Carolwood Drive, has a 5,300-square-foot master suite and a club level with bar, dance floor, wine room, lap pool, theater complex, beauty parlor and massage rooms. The property also includes several guesthouses and staff housing. The broker, Ginger Glass, said the price of the property was justified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Buyers today want new construction,’’ she said. ‘‘And there isn’t anything that’s new like this in such a great location.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still more nine-figure homes are on the way. Real estate agents and developers say a home under construction in Bel Air is likely to have more than 50,000 square feet of living space, with finishes rivaling a superyacht’s. The price will be yacht-like, too, at around $300 million. Among the home’s amenities: the world’s largest safe.</p>

</div><div class="author">By PAUL SULLIVAN </div><div>1115 words</div><div>31 May 2016</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>14</div><div>English</div><div>© 2016 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With his divorce completed, Vishal Kapoor, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, Calif., bought a 6,500-square-foot house and began outfitting it for his new life as a single man. One thing he wanted was a gym. So he built one and filled it with the latest equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He estimated that the 250-square-foot gym cost about $200,000 and he spent an additional $60,000 on equipment. ‘‘We had the option of putting it in one of the rooms,’’ Dr. Kapoor said. ‘‘But it was dark and there’s no natural light. The way it is now, there’s a lot of natural light. It just makes it nicer.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The summer months are a particularly popular time for updating houses, with new bathrooms, new kitchens or even a new roof. But whether the renovations add to a home’s value — that’s a different matter. Even when they do increase the price a seller may get, they rarely increase it in line with how much the renovation costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘People confuse helping the home keep up with the market with an upgrade or a renovation,’’ said Jonathan J. Miller, the president and chief executive of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraisal firm that covers the New York metropolitan area. ‘‘The simplest example may be refinishing your floors or repainting the inside of your house. Those are things that need to happen every so often so the house doesn’t fall behind the market.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With renovations, he said the relationship between cost and value are always changing. At times, a $100,000 renovation may add only $50,000 to the value of a home. In other instances, spending $50,000 may increase the value by $100,000, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there are the times when the renovation may decrease the home’s value. Mr. Miller said he remembered a one-bedroom apartment in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City that he appraised almost three decades ago. The apartment had a $30,000 built-in entertainment system that was purple Formica. ‘‘The owner thinks the value is the apartment plus $30,000,’’ Mr. Miller said. ‘‘The buyer is thinking it’s the value of the apartment minus $3,000 to remove it and repair the wall. Here lies the problem.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is going to add value depends as much on the type of renovation as the particular housing market. And Mr. Miller said he tells clients that ‘‘personal taste and market taste’’ can be different.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New roofs and insulation have great financial returns, said Jessica Lautz, managing director of survey research at the National Association of Realtors, which teamed up last year with the National Association of the Remodeling Industry to determine the value of renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lautz said people who would like to recoup more of their investment would do better by aiming for boring. Putting in new insulation and garage doors or replacing a roof, siding or windows adds value and saves energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But new kitchens and bathrooms make owners happy, and their value is more difficult to discern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Stan Humphries, the chief economist for the Zillow Group, said he found in his research that high-end bath and kitchen renovations were among the worst investments (though not as bad as finishing a basement).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, he said, a ‘‘midrange bathroom remodel’’ could reap a big increase in value. These are renovations where a fairly bland bathroom is made into something ‘‘you’d bring your guests into,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the renovation, its ability to increase the value of a home can be short-lived. ‘‘A renovation beyond three years — unless it’s something major like a new story of your house — isn’t going to matter that much,’’ he said. ‘‘The new car smell of that renovation has gone away, and your neighbors have done the same thing.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Lautz said, big, expensive renovations may be necessary just for sellers to attract interest on photo-heavy real estate websites. ‘‘You look at homes online and see the new kitchens and bathrooms that really sparkle,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This benefit varies, depending on demand in a particular housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘If you’re in a housing market with very tight supply, all of a sudden the value spread between a home that needs a lot of work and the home that doesn’t need any narrows,’’ Mr. Miller said. ‘‘In a market where there is an oversupply, it’s just the opposite. There’s more of a premium for a home that has already been done.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Canaan, Conn., an affluent town an hour from New York City, is experiencing one of those gluts. Amanda Briggs, the brokerage manager at Houlihan Lawrence there, said the town had a lot of listings for large, four-story homes that are 10 to 15 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘They’re perfectly maintained,’’ she said. ‘‘But these houses look more dated than they are. The cabinets look outdated. Buyers want to redo them, and they’re factoring in the costs.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor at work is the difference between what Ms. Briggs called buyer’s math and seller’s math. ‘‘Sellers think acquisition cost plus what I put into it is what it’s worth,’’ she said. ‘‘Buyers are looking at price per square foot and Zillow’s analytics.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for personal touches, how they contribute to value depends on whether they make a home more or less attractive relative to the homes around it. Lilly Lenavitt, an agent with Compass, a real estate agency in Los Angeles, said the basic upgrades apply in that market, with a premium placed on pools. The value of a gym could go either way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘If they can put a gym in and it’s just a room where all the equipment can come out, it’s O.K.,’’ she said. ‘‘If you’ve personalized it and it can only be used as a gym, you’re narrowing your buyers.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kapoor said he made his home gym look like a high-end health club, from top-of-the-line equipment and wiring to the stacks of towels and refrigerator filled with Gatorade. But regarding the investment potential of the space, he hesitated. ‘‘Do I think I’d get my money back? I don’t know,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I have my kids 40 percent of the time,’’ he added. ‘‘They want to be with me. At least now, I can work out in my gym and they can pop in if they need me.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that nod to personal enjoyment may be the only guaranteed return on any renovation.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Business spending intentions in the United States weakened in April for a third straight month, and contracts to buy previously owned homes surged to a 10-year high, data released on Thursday showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report showed that the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell last week, supporting views that economic growth is gaining speed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The weak performance in business capital investment activity suggests that this segment remains a source of drag for the U.S. economic recovery,'' said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York. ''Over all, domestic growth momentum appears to be on the mend.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 0.8 percent after slipping 0.1 percent the previous month. These so-called core capital goods orders have now declined for three consecutive months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing sector remains pressured by lower energy prices, which have eroded profits of energy companies and forced oil field services firms like <span class="companylink">Schlumberger</span> and <span class="companylink">Halliburton</span> to slash capital spending budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy, has also taken a knock from efforts by businesses to slim down an inventory bloat, which has undercut growth in new orders. A strong dollar has been a drag on exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shipments of core capital goods, used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.3 percent last month, reversing March's 0.3 percent drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the factory sector weakness has been concentrated in the heavy machinery segment, where manufacturers have also been hurt by reduced demand for agricultural equipment. In April, orders for machinery tumbled 1.9 percent after dropping 0.8 percent in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said its pending home sales index jumped 5.1 percent last month to its highest level since February 2006. Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and April's surge pointed to further gains in home resales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is being underpinned by a tightening labor market, which is starting to lift wages, as well as still very low mortgage rates. But a shortage of properties available for sale remains a hurdle and house prices have risen faster than wages, sidelining some first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third report, from the Labor Department, showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 268,000 for the week ended May 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong job market, for 64 straight weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending homes sales and jobless claims data joined reports on retail sales, housing and industrial production in suggesting the economy was gaining steam after growth slowed to a 0.5 percent annual pace in the first quarter. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta</span> is currently estimating second-quarter G.D.P. growth at a 2.9 percent rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department report also showed orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, jumped 3.4 percent last month after increasing 1.9 percent in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in durable goods orders last month was led by an 8.9 percent jump in bookings for transportation equipment. Orders for civilian aircraft soared 64.9 percent. There were increases in orders for motor vehicles, fabricated metal products, computers and electronic goods, and electrical equipment, appliances and components.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable goods inventories declined further in April, a good sign for the manufacturing's future prospects, while unfilled orders increased 0.6 percent. Durable goods shipments rose 0.6 percent after two consecutive months of declines.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Consumer prices in April recorded their biggest increase in more than three years in the United States as gasoline and rents rose, pointing to a steady inflation buildup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data on Tuesday showed that housing starts and industrial production rebounded strongly last month, suggesting the economy was regaining steam early in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The combination of higher prices, housing gains and industrial production support the narrative of a second-quarter rebound in G.D.P.,” said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/consumer_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] increased 0.4 percent last month, the largest gain since February 2013, after rising 0.1 percent in March. That took the year-on-year increase in the C.P.I. to 1.1 percent from 0.9 percent in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans also paid more for medical care, food, recreation, tobacco, motor vehicle insurance, airline fares and grooming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The so-called core C.P.I., which strips out food and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent after climbing 0.1 percent in March. In the 12 months through April, the core C.P.I. increased 2.1 percent, after increasing 2.2 percent in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure, which is currently at 1.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts increased 6.6 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.17 million units last month as builders ramped up the construction of single- and multifamily homes. Building permits rose 3.6 percent to a 1.12 million-unit rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third report, from the Fed, showed that industrial production increased 0.7 percent in April after two straight months of declines. Manufacturing output rose 0.3 percent, reversing March’s 0.3 percent decrease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Utilities production jumped 5.8 percent in April, but mining output fell 2.3 percent. Mining production continues to be undermined by the delayed pass-through of the oil price plunge between June 2014 and December 2015, which has caused a sharp reduction in capital spending by energy firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inflation report showed gasoline prices jumped 8.1 percent last month, the largest gain since August 2012, adding to March’s 2.2 percent increase. Food prices[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/food_prices/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] rose 0.2 percent after falling 0.2 percent in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core C.P.I. was lifted by housing and medical costs, as well as transportation services. Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.3 percent after increasing 0.2 percent in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Medical care costs picked up, rising 0.3 percent after gaining 0.1 percent in March. Prescription drugs shot up 0.7 percent and the cost of hospital services increased 0.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apparel prices fell for a second straight month, as did the cost of used cars and trucks. Prices for new motor vehicles fell 0.3 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A VILLA ON THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC'S NORTH COAST</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$1,275,300</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This three-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath house, called Casa de Cana after the type of palm used in its roof, is on the country's north coast, in the town of Cabrera, which has a population of about 25,000. It's in a lush, secluded area, said Jennifer Cabot, one of the owners, whose primary home is on the island of Nantucket in Massachusetts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A winding road leads to the property, which sits on two and a third acres. The 3,700-square-foot house, built in 2010, is made up of three pavilions that are connected by open-air walkways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An antique mahogany door gives way to the central pavilion, which has the living room, dining room and kitchen. The décor of the living room includes surfboards affixed to the walls, Indonesian-style daybeds and African textiles. The kitchen has a 48-inch Viking range and double oven. The wall closest to the ocean is made of multiple bifold glass doors that lead to a terrace. ''As soon as you walk in the front door, it's just ocean everywhere. You almost feel like you're on the bow of a big boat,'' Ms. Cabot said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the left of the central pavilion as you face the ocean, a raised outdoor walkway leads to the master bedroom pavilion, which has an oceanfront terrace and an en-suite bath with two showers. One, combined with the bathtub, is inside, and the other is outdoors. To the right of the central pavilion, a walkway leads to the third pavilion, with two bedrooms, each having a terrace and an en-suite bath. The house is being sold furnished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walls, floors and the kitchen counters of the house are made of concrete; the palm roof has weatherproofing beneath the leaves. For electricity, the property relies on solar power and a backup generator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property has a swimming pool and a rocky area of the shoreline, reached by stairs, where swimming is sometimes possible, Ms. Cabot said, adding that the water there is often rough. There is also a detached garage. The current staff of six includes a cook and two security guards, their salaries paid by rental income from the house, Ms. Cabot said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area is less developed than the country's south, Ms. Cabot said. Cabrera has banks, supermarkets, restaurants and medical facilities. Playa Grande, a five-minute drive, has two high-end resorts, Amanera and the Playa Grande Beach Club. Samaná El Catey International Airport is approximately an hour's drive, and the international airport in Puerto Plata is about an hour and 40 minutes away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKET OVERVIEW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dominican Republic's real estate market has not yet fully recovered from the 2008 global financial crisis, agents said. But Cesar Herrera Gutiérrez, the president and chief executive of Provaltur International, the exclusive affiliate for <span class="companylink">Christie's International Real Estate</span> in the Dominican Republic, which has this listing, said prices for top luxury homes are stable, and in some cases have begun to rise. He defined these homes as being in the top 1 percent of their local markets and typically having an asking price of at least $5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bottom has been hit and now, up it goes,'' Mr. Herrera Gutiérrez said of the market for those most exclusive properties. For properties priced between about $1 million and $5 million, it's a buyer's market, with stable prices that are often negotiable, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Herrera Gutiérrez said that the prices per square foot of luxury homes in the Dominican Republic are among the lowest in the Caribbean. Supply is ample, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dominican Republic is a second-home market for North Americans, so its performance is tied to the United States and Canadian economies, said Sandy Parekh, an owner of Re/Max Coral Bay Realty. The volume of luxury transactions has picked up by about 10 percent in the last year, but it is ''certainly nowhere near 2008.'' That trend also holds true for the general market, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury home buyers want properties in gated beachfront developments and with amenities like security, restaurants and utilities included in a membership fee. Agents said Punta Cana, Casa de Campo, Cap Cana and Sosua are desirable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower end of the luxury market begins at around $100 per square foot and reaches around $420 per square foot for a prime oceanfront home, Mr. Parekh said. The highest-priced home he knows of is listed at $25 million, but typically listings do not top $5 million in the north and $9 million in the south, Mr. Parekh added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO BUYS IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parekh said most of his clients come from North America, because they are familiar with the Re/Max brand. There has been a slight drop in the number of Canadian buyers recently, and an increase in the number of United States expatriates moving from the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, and Bermuda, which have a higher cost of living, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parekh said that, as a rough estimate, 30 to 50 percent of homeowners in luxury developments are Dominican. Foreigners are split evenly between buying for retirement and for vacation, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Herrera Gutiérrez said that in the last six to eight months he has seen rising interest from Europeans. He has been working recently with prospective buyers from Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Italy, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYING BASICS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in the Dominican Republic are handled by a lawyer, who customarily charges 1 percent of the purchase price, said Alfredo Guzmán-Saladín, a partner with Guzmán Ariza, a law firm with offices throughout the country. Each party hires its own lawyer. Services of a notary, for authenticating signatures before the title transfer, are usually included in the attorney fee, he said. (A new law mandates progressive notary fees, but its application is being disputed in court, he added.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from those fees, the buyer also pays a title transfer tax, which is 3 percent of the property's government-appraised value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dominican Republic does not have a stamp duty, unlike many other Caribbean countries. The seller pays the real estate agent's commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Guzmán-Saladín urges buyers to ensure their lawyer performs due diligence. This includes, in particular, checking that the property's title is clean, meaning that there are no title liens, mortgages or third party rights, and that it is definite, meaning that its boundaries have been accurately surveyed. He also recommends checking for tax liens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parties can choose their preferred currency. Transactions for high-end properties, whether buyers are local or foreign, are typically done in United States dollars, Mr. Guzmán-Saladín said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Tips for House Hunting in a Seller's Market</span>
</div><div class="author">By ANN CARRNS </div><div>1015 words</div><div>14 May 2016</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lack of homes for sale in many parts of the country is making house hunting a challenge this spring, especially for first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight housing inventories have pushed up home prices in many metropolitan markets, creating bidding wars for some properties, real estate experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate is highly local, of course, and trends range by city and by neighborhood. But nationally, home prices in March were up nearly 7 percent from a year ago, and up 2 percent from February, according to the latest data from <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dearth of inventory is particularly acute for entry-level homes, said Svenja Gudell, the chief economist at the real estate website Zillow. ''First-time homebuyers are having a tough time,'' she said, ''because so few homes are available.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, 6 percent fewer homes are on the market compared with a year ago, and there are 10 percent fewer entry-level homes, according to March data from Zillow. Some markets are particularly tight: Portland, Ore., has 40 percent fewer entry-level homes, and Charlotte, N.C., has 35 percent fewer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons for the tight inventory vary, Ms. Gudell said. In some areas, homeowners are still underwater -- meaning they owe more than their home is worth -- so they are unable or unwilling to sell until prices rise more and they gain equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other markets, the lack of new home construction is contributing to the problem. Homeowners who want to sell their homes and trade up can't find a suitable new home, so they stay put -- keeping their property off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of homes on the market has also helped raise rents, so investors who bought single-family homes during the downturn are making good money renting them out and aren't in a hurry to sell, said Greg Jaeger, president of USAA Residential Real Estate Services, a brokerage affiliated with <span class="companylink">USAA Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lee Ritchie, a real estate agent with Re/Max Metro Plus in Columbus, Ohio, said inventory in the city was generally low, especially in downtown neighborhoods where people can walk to parks and shops. ''It's multiple offers on every property,'' she said. She said she spent a lot of time explaining to buyers that they should make their best offer right away, and move quickly if they see a home they like. ''Sometimes,'' she said in an email, ''a buyer has to lose a home or two before they really comprehend how aggressive they need to be in order to win.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many markets are favorable for sellers. Kim Stone said she was thrilled to have several inquiries about her family's two-bedroom, two-bath home, in a desirable neighborhood near San Antonio, within hours after it was listed in March. The house was made available on a Thursday, shown on Friday and went under contract that weekend to an all-cash buyer -- for 10 percent above the asking price. She, her husband and their two children are now living in an apartment while their new home is under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers, though, may have to be patient. Kat Doucette, a real estate lawyer in San Antonio, said she and her husband searched for months before buying in an up-and-coming part of the city known as Southtown. Many properties were overpriced, she said, given the renovations needed. ''I did a lot of research,'' she said. The couple finally bought a home last August and are in the midst of adding a bathroom. Her advice? Know what you are looking for and be ready to pounce when you find it, but ''don't pay too much.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some questions and answers about buying a home this spring:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; What can I do to prepare to buy a house in a tight market?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get preapproved for a mortgage, so the seller knows you are serious, and make sure you have a preapproval letter, rather than one saying you are merely ''prequalified,'' said Tom Salomone, president of the National Association of Realtors. ''There's a big difference.'' Prequalification may be based on verbal information given by the borrower, he said, while preapproval means the lender has run a credit check, verified your income and has authorized a loan for a specific amount of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; Are there other ways, besides price, to make my offer attractive?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Putting down as large a deposit as possible shows you're serious, Mr. Salomone said. And agreeing to requests that reduce hassles for the seller can help, too. For instance, if the seller asks to leave behind a backyard swing set, you may want to agree -- even if your children are too old to play on it. ''Let them leave it, and you can take care of it,'' he said. ''It may be advantageous.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In areas with extremely low inventories, buyers may have to go further. Traditionally, a home inspection is done after an offer is made and accepted. Contracts typically contain language allowing the buyer to negotiate repairs if the inspection turns up problems. In some tight markets, like Seattle, buyers are having homes preinspected at their own cost, seeking to appeal to the seller by making an offer without a contingency clause, Ms. Gudell said. That can get expensive if shoppers end up making multiple offers; inspections can range from $150 for a basic walk-through to $800 or more for a detailed inspection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; What's happening with home mortgage rates?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright spot for house hunters is that mortgage rates are remaining low. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.61 percent for the week that ended May 5, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Shoppers seeking home loans, however, should be prepared to provide detailed financial information because of tougher requirements since the financial crisis. ''Much more documentation is needed,'' Mr. Salomone said. To minimize delays, he said, have tax returns, pay stubs and W-2 forms on hand when you meet with your lender.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA -- Seeking to do more than provide basic homes for its residents, this city's public housing agency is taking a new approach to neighborhood revitalization. In its latest project, it is adding commercial and educational development to its main role of home building, aiming to address the underlying causes of urban distress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the northern part of the city, the Philadelphia Housing Authority is razing part of the Norman Blumberg Apartments in the Sharswood neighborhood, which has had especially high rates of poverty, crime and urban blight. The agency plans to bring in shops, offices and schools, along with housing, in an ambitious program to breathe new life into a struggling community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $500 million project, just two and a half miles from downtown Philadelphia, aims to recreate a middle-class community that never recovered after being ravaged by rioting in the 1960s, agency officials say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two high-rise apartment buildings from the late 1960s that had become symbols of urban decay were imploded in mid-March in the most conspicuous stage so far of the project. Other dilapidated housing has also been removed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the multiyear Sharswood Blumberg Choice Neighborhoods Transformation Plan, commercial development and new or reopened public schools, as well as fresh housing, will offer the neighborhood its best chance of recovery, said Kelvin A. Jeremiah, president of the Philadelphia Housing Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We never really came up with a comprehensive approach that went beyond housing,'' Mr. Jeremiah said. ''If you only focus on housing, what about the crime issues? What about amenities? What about the education?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plan, the destroyed towers, as well as some other low-rise apartment buildings on the eight-acre site, will be replaced by 1,200 new housing units. Most will be for rent or sale at below-market prices. The first phase of the new construction, containing 57 units, is underway and is due for completion this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central to the new vision will be the creation of a new commercial corridor along Ridge Avenue, the neighborhood's main street, which lost businesses as the local economy declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, the plan projects 400,000 square feet of commercial space. The agency said it was close to making a deal for a drugstore and a supermarket. It is also seeking agreements with other businesses like banks, Mr. Jeremiah said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing authority plans to move its headquarters to the street from downtown, bringing around 1,100 employees, who will bolster demand for businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jeremiah said the agency was in talks with some private developers who were attracted to the project because of its proximity to adjoining neighborhoods like Brewerytown to the west and Francisville to the southeast. In those neighborhoods, new construction is popping up and property prices are rising as a real estate boom ripples outward from downtown, or Center City, Philadelphia, with residents seeking more affordable options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Michaels Development Company, a developer of affordable housing, plans to build 42 affordable rental units in Sharswood. The company's senior vice president, Milton R. Pratt Jr., said the neighborhood was well positioned to turn itself around given the buoyant market nearby and its proximity to Center City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is one of the most attractive neighborhoods in the city for redevelopment,'' Mr. Pratt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar efforts to involve private developers in public housing projects have taken place in Chicago. Molly Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Housing Authority, said the agency had redeveloped several neighborhoods by combining public and market-rate housing with commercial development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">New York City Housing Authority</span> offers commercial space at market rates to businesses like dry cleaners, delis, supermarkets and barbershops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philadelphia officials say that city's revitalization plan also depends on providing public schools to replace two that shut down in 2013. The housing authority is working with the school district and Big Picture Learning, an educational nonprofit, to decide whether to reopen the shuttered schools or build anew, said Nichole Tillman, a spokeswoman for the housing agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project has attracted support from the federal <span class="companylink">Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, which awarded it a $500,000 planning grant under its Choice Neighborhoods program. Jane Vincent, an administrator for the federal agency, said the grant reflected the project's potential and federal, state and local involvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It really is transforming the neighborhood,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While other Philadelphia neighborhoods are plagued by poverty and crime, the problems are especially acute in Sharswood, Mr. Jeremiah said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're looking at a neighborhood that is severely distressed,'' he said, noting that the poverty rate in the predominantly black Sharswood community is 53 percent, or twice the rate for Philadelphia as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jeremiah said that during an evening trip to the neighborhood in 2013, soon after he became head of the housing agency, he encountered a man who threatened him with a gun when he refused to buy drugs. After hearing residents' stories of crime in the area, he thought the housing authority ought to focus on the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have to do better by these families,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 500 families were temporarily relocated to low-income housing elsewhere in the city while the project takes shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To create space for the new housing, the agency has been buying property from residents, but it has met resistance from some who say it has offered prices far below market value. In some cases, the agency has used eminent domain to acquire parcels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Scott, a resident of Sharswood since 1969, said the agency offered him around $60,000 for a house, a commercial building and a vacant lot that he said together were worth about $300,000. He rejected the offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting on a wooden fence bordering one of the neighborhood's 1,300 vacant lots, Mr. Scott, 49, said he welcomed the revival plan because ''it's time for the neighborhood,'' but he is waiting for a higher offer for his property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A neighbor, Kim Wong, 69, said the housing authority offered him $28,000 for his house, one of only three still standing on his block. He said the property was worth $105,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tillman said that the housing agency was committed to giving residents fair prices for their properties and that owners were entitled to a reappraisal at the agency's expense if they were dissatisfied with an offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Scolnic, a real estate lawyer with the Philadelphia firm <span class="companylink">Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin &amp; Schiller</span>, said the redevelopment plan had great potential to improve one of Philadelphia's poorest neighborhoods. But its success, he added, hinges on whether new businesses can be persuaded to open there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The key to the whole development is how quickly can you get people back into the neighborhood, and that will give the retailers a chance to succeed if there are sufficient residents there,'' Mr. Scolnic said. ''If it works, it could be a model for similar developments nationwide.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the 1930s through the 1960s, most African-Americans could not get mortgages because the government had deemed neighborhoods where they lived ineligible for federal mortgage insurance, the Depression-era innovation that made mortgages widely affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation exposed black families to hucksters who peddled homeownership through contracts for deed, in which a home seller gives a buyer a high-interest loan, coupled with a pledge to turn over the deed after 20 to 40 years of monthly installment payments. These contracts enriched the sellers by draining the buyers, who built no equity and were often evicted for minor or alleged infractions, at which point the owner would enter into a contract with another buyer. In the process, families and neighborhoods were ruined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contracts for deed are making a comeback. They are increasingly being used by investment firms that have bought thousands of foreclosed homes and want to sell them to lower-income buyers ''as is,'' according to a recent report in The Times by Alexandra Stevenson and Matthew Goldstein. Many of the homes are in Alabama, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio. In one example in the article, investors who bought foreclosed homes at an average price of $8,000 issued a contract on one in Ohio in 2011 for $36,300 at 10 percent interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contracts for deed make gouging possible, because unlike traditional mortgages, there is no appraisal or inspection to ensure that the loan amount is reasonable. They also let an investor swiftly evict buyers for missed payments, rather than giving them time to catch up, as required under a mortgage. And they usually require the buyer to pay hefty upfront fees. Unlike a rental security deposit, however, the fee is almost never refundable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contracts for deed are similar in some ways to the subprime lending that contributed to the housing bust in this century. Investors in the contracts include some of the Wall Street players who inflated the mortgage bubble, including Daniel Sparks, the former <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> executive, whose department was betting on a crash in 2007 even as the bank was selling toxic mortgage securities. The stated rationale for contracts for deed is that low-income buyers cannot qualify for mortgages -- the same line that was used to justify subprime lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What became evident from the crash was that many subprime borrowers who were wiped out -- and who were disproportionately black and Hispanic -- could have qualified for better terms and were misled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even for buyers truly unable to get mortgages, contracts for deed nearly always inflict harm. The exception is a few programs where public agencies or nonprofits use interest-free contracts to sell homes to needy families and then help them refinance into traditional mortgages. Federal housing agencies could foster that approach by selling more of their foreclosed properties to nonprofits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> must assert its authority over these contracts, which are legally murky and hard to track. Some states do not require that they be recorded, and in states that do, noncompliance is high. The bureau's mandate is to stop unfair, deceptive or predatory lending. Contracts for deed are all three.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KIRK JOHNSON </div><div>1203 words</div><div>19 April 2016</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRIDAY HARBOR, Wash. -- Here in the San Juan Islands of northwest Washington State, where a severe shortage of affordable housing threatens the economy and the community, a small nonprofit group has found an unlikely way to help anchor families that are struggling to stay -- by lifting up unloved houses in Canada, hoisting them onto barges and hauling them to where they are needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The houses are small by modern standards and old, built in the early to mid-20th century in a booming suburb of Victoria, British Columbia, where eager buyers are now clearing the land to make way for new construction. But the structures had what builders call good bones, and the group, the San Juan Community HomeTrust, discovered that the cost of transporting them across the Haro Strait from Canada and restoring them here was comparable to the cost of building from scratch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project met a rapidly growing need: A surge of tourism and vacation home buyers in San Juan County -- an archipelago of islands about 70 miles from Seattle, reachable only by air, boat or ferry -- has gone hand-in-hand in recent years with a decline in fishing, shipping and agriculture jobs that once supported a middle-class island life. The number of people living in poverty in the county has risen about 17 percent since the end of the recession in 2009, according to census figures, even as the economic recovery in Washington and around the nation gained steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's kind life or death to keep our working families here,'' said Peter Kilpatrick, the project manager in refitting the houses to be imported by the San Juan Community HomeTrust. When the rewiring, painting and structural repairs are finished in June, buyers who have already met income and residency requirements can take possession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through a combination of donated land, government and foundation grants and local fund-raising, the homes will cost the buyers -- a hospital worker, several teachers and a massage therapist among them -- from $160,000 to $210,000. The median market price here was almost $500,000 at the end of last year, nearly the same as in Seattle, which made San Juan the least affordable county in the state for first-time buyers, according to the Runstad Center for Real Estate Studies at the <span class="companylink">University of Washington</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National housing experts said the house relocation project here and another on a nearby island might be the first of their kind. But examples of the innovation that inspired the effort, they said, are easy to find -- fueled in many spots around the nation by desperation as homelessness has risen and working-class families have struggled with rising prices and rents, or an inability to find homes at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things are getting crazy,'' said Carlos Martín, a senior fellow at the <span class="companylink">Urban Institute</span>, a research group in Washington, D.C. ''And when people have got to the point when they have no alternative but to be completely creative, that is when these things happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing advocates in Honolulu, for example, are trying to bring back traditional Hawaiian frond-woven homes as a less costly alternative to wood and concrete. In many other cities, believers in the tiny-house movement are preaching the virtues, and lower costs, of simplified, stripped-down housing. Portland, Ore., and Berkeley, Calif., recently passed ordinances making it easier for a homeowner to build an apartment in the basement or a cottage for rent in the backyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stricter environmental rules now in effect in British Columbia are also making imported homes more appealing and affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You used to be able to take an excavator, crunch a house and take it to the landfill,'' said Jim Connelly, the sales manager for southern Vancouver Island at Nickel Brothers, which moves about 100 homes a year on the commercial market and has transported seven so far for the Friday Harbor project and plans to move five more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Mr. Connelly said, the province requires hazardous material reports and abatement, and the sorting of materials from metal to drywall for possible reuse. That has driven up the cost of tearing down an old house, he said, from 3,000 or so Canadian dollars in the 1990s to upward of $40,000 now (about $31,200 in American dollars).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The older houses, which will stand within a development of 14 new homes, all suffered varying degrees of trauma in transit. Basements were left behind when the houses were shaved off their foundations. Chimneys were abandoned as well, because old masonry was too fragile and risky to move. In some cases roofs or exterior walls had to be carved away to allow a building to fit under or around obstacles like underpasses or trees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the moment, the homes sit on steel I-beams and wooden blocks while concrete foundations are poured. In the way of all old houses, they are imperfect and uneven, with parts that have settled and sagged or were never built to exact specifications. Placing them on a level platform, Mr. Kilpatrick said, has exposed all of their quirks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The house wasn't level where it came from,'' he said, pointing to a door that probably opened and closed easily on the old foundation, but now hangs askew and is in need of repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing experts and board members at the San Juan Community HomeTrust said that beyond cost effectiveness, another appeal of the project was more subtle, but no less crucial: The trust's financial donors have responded well to the idea that old houses of character are being rescued, along with local families. A Pacific Northwest environmental ethos to reuse and recycle has become part of the fund-raising appeal, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to create a buzz,'' said Sam Buck, the board's vice president. ''And this has gotten people here excited, more than we ever anticipated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few people could be more excited than Kat Sherman, 36, and her fiancé, Adam D'Errico, 37, who qualified to buy one of the houses. Both work at a hardware store, she in accounting while he manages the paint department. To make ends meet, both have second jobs stocking shelves at a grocery store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The saying here is that you either own three homes or you have three jobs,'' Ms. Sherman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hard work will continue, she and Mr. Sherman said in an interview at the hardware store, but a home of their own will provide stability and permanence in a place they love.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This program is great in allowing people -- the worker bees of the island -- to be able to afford a home, to able to stay,'' Ms. D'Errico said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home prices in the United States climbed again at the start of the year, adding to pressure on buyers in a sellers' market. Americans are feeling more confident this month, another report released on Tuesday showed, as a rebounding stock market brightened their outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5.7 percent from a year earlier, a slight increase from the 5.6 percent annual increase in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The pace of U.S. home value growth has been picking up bit by bit over the past few months, driven in large part by stubbornly low inventory in most markets that creates competition and drives up prices for those homes that are available,'' said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at the real estate firm Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values have risen at a faster pace than average hourly wages, which have improved just 2.2 percent, according to a government report this month. Tight supplies of homes for sale have propelled much of the price growth, as low mortgage rates and steady hiring have increased demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denver, Portland, San Francisco and Seattle each registered double-digit annual price increases. Home values rose in all 20 metro area markets, which account for roughly half of the housing stock in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index remains more than 11 percent below its mid-2006 peak, when subprime mortgages pushed the market to heights that set off the recession in late 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.08 million in February, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said this month. Sales dipped 7.1 percent from a relatively healthy pace in January, but an increase in the number of signed contracts to buy houses indicates that purchases should rebound in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the demand, listings in February declined 1.1 percent from a year ago. Many homeowners are reluctant to sell, because they lack the equity to cover the down payment for a new house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The low inventory of homes for sale -- currently about a five-month supply -- means that would-be sellers seeking to trade up are having a hard time finding a new, larger home,'' said David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said that its consumer confidence index rose to 96.2 this month, after tumbling to a revised 94 in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' assessment of current economic conditions has dipped. But their outlook for the future has improved modestly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States markets got off to a dismal start in 2016, driven by fears of economic weakness overseas and plunging oil prices, but they have since recovered most of those losses. This month, 28.7 percent of consumers said they expected stocks to rise over the next year. That was up from 26.9 percent in February, the lowest share since July 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, the overall consumer confidence index stood at 101.4. But Americans have grown cautious, and consumer spending grew at a meager 0.1 percent annual rate in February, the government said on Monday, matching January's unimpressive gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Given the very disappointing real consumer spending results for January and February, this pickup in confidence is good news,'' said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Sales of new single-family homes in the United States rebounded in February, but the increase was concentrated in one region, which could suggest a loss of momentum in the housing market as the busy spring selling season kicks off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that new-home sales rose 2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 512,000 units. January’s sales pace was revised up to 502,000 units, from 494,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such sales surged 38.5 percent in the West last month. They fell 24.2 percent in the Northeast, 17.9 percent in the Midwest and 4.1 percent in the populous South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report comes on the heels of data on Monday[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/business/economy/existing-home-sales-drop-more-than-expected.html] showing that in February, sales of previously owned homes fell 7.1 percent, which economists attributed to tight inventories and difficulties in adjusting the data for last month, which had a leap day. They also blamed snowstorms in January, which caused a drop in contract signings, for the weak sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> also showed some weakness in housing activity, with its seasonally adjusted Purchase Index decreasing 1 percent last week from a week earlier. The index, however, increased 25 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the strengthening labor market bolstering household formation and mortgage rates still low by historical standards, housing fundamentals remain solid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the dearth of homes for sale, which is limiting options for buyers and pushing up prices, is a major challenge for the industry. While the inventory of new homes on the market rose 1.7 percent in February to the highest level since October 2009, it remained less than half of what it was at the height of the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At February’s sales pace, it would take 5.6 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, unchanged from January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With housing stock improving, the pace of price appreciation for new homes is slowing. The median price of a new home rose 2.6 percent in February from a year ago, to $301,400.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Americans retreated from home-buying in February, reversing months of prior gains as low inventories push up prices to levels that restrict sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday that sales of existing homes fell 7.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.08 million. The decline follows robust yearly sales rates of 5.47 million in January and 5.45 million in December, a new regulation delayed closings in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market enters the traditional spring buying season facing a quandary: There are relatively few properties listed for sale, even as steady job gains and low mortgage rates have bolstered demand from would-be buyers. The limited supplies have propelled rising prices that have, in turn, reduced affordability and limited sales levels. These cost pressures were further enhanced by a volatile stock market that hit down payment savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We assume the plunge in the stock market in the first six weeks of this year persuaded some potential homebuyers to reconsider, at least temporarily,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He added that sales volumes might pick up in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home sales price was $210,800 in February, a 4.4 percent annual increase from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight supplies have driven the increases in home prices, forcing buyers to bid more for hotly contested homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listings in February fell 1.1 percent from a year ago. Many homeowners are hesitant to sell, since they would need more equity to cover the down payment for stepping up to a new property. Investors have also turned homes into rentals, further depriving the market of supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Realtors</span> have forecast that overall sales levels will be nearly unchanged this year, after a 6.5 percent gain in 2015. But median sales prices are forecast to rise 4 percent, meaningfully faster than wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-buying fell sharply in the Northeast and Midwest last month, while slipping less severely in the South and West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors accounted for 18 percent of sales in February. First-time buyers made up 30 percent of purchases, staying persistently below their historic share of 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shortage remains a consequence of the burst housing bubble, which initially flooded the market with distressed foreclosures and then left a limited selection of homes for buyers as the recovery from the recession surpassed 6 ½ years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have been aided over the past year by hiring that has pushed unemployment to a healthy 4.9 percent. And homebuyers are benefiting from relatively low borrowing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage buyer <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday that the average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 3.73 percent last week, compared with a historic average of roughly 6 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of new single-family homes in the United States tumbled in January from a 10-month high, but the overall housing market recovery remains intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data on Wednesday showed that the services sector contracted in early February for the first time since October 2013 at a time of concerns about the economic outlook. Bad weather also hampered activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said single-family-home sales dropped 9.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 494,000 units, almost unwinding December's sharp increase. December's sales pace was unrevised at 544,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in the West, where home prices have increased sharply at a time of tight inventories, plummeted 32.1 percent, to a 110,000 unit rate, the lowest level since July 2014. The percentage decline was the largest since May 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 3.4 percent in the Northeast, despite a blizzard in late January. They fell 5.9 percent in the Midwest and rose 1.8 percent in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-homes market, whose sales account for 8.3 percent of the overall housing market, appears to have cooled, with construction activity falling in January and home builder sentiment softening this month. But housing in general remains supported by a tightening labor market, which is lifting wage growth and bolstering household formation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports on Tuesday showed sales of previously owned homes hitting a six-month high in January and house prices rising 5.7 percent in the year to December. While mortgage applications fell last week, they retained half of the previous week's increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the data firm Markit said its flash United States services PMI business activity index fell to 49.8 early this month from 53.2 in January. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in services sector activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with respondents also blaming the harsh weather in the Northeast, the decline in the index probably exaggerates the slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A firmer housing market should help prop up the economy as it navigates rough seas caused by a robust dollar, spending cuts by energy companies hurt by lower oil prices and sluggish global demand. Efforts by businesses to sell off inventory are holding back growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. Growth estimates for the first quarter are currently above a 2 percent rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the inventory of new homes on the market increased 2.1 percent to 238,000 units, the highest since October 2009. Still, housing stock remains tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At January's sales pace, it would take 5.8 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.1 months in December. The median price of a new home fell 4.5 percent from a year ago to $278,800.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Industrial Production Jumps, Pointing to Resilience in U.S. Economy</span>
</div><div class="author">By REUTERS   </div><div>555 words</div><div>18 February 2016</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Industrial production in the United States had its largest gain in 14 months in January as manufacturing and utilities output increased, the latest sign that the economy regained some ground early in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While other data on Wednesday showed a surprise decline in housing starts last month, that was probably because of bad weather, especially in the Northeast and Midwest. With building permits ahead of groundbreaking activity, home construction is likely to pick up in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first increase in industrial output in five months should help allay the fears of a recession that have shaken up the stock market and eliminated bets for an interest-rate increase from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production rose 0.9 percent last month, the largest increase since November 2014, the Fed said. That followed a 0.7 percent decline in December and was helped by a 0.5 percent advance in manufacturing output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in manufacturing production reflected gains in the output of long-lasting goods, as well as food and chemicals. But manufacturing is not out of trouble and will continue to be buffeted by a strong dollar, weak global demand and lower oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production was also lifted by a 5.4 percent surge in utilities production as the return of normal winter temperatures produced a jump in demand for heating. Mining output was flat after four consecutive months of hefty declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The overall tone of this report was encouraging, pointing to a respite in the ongoing recession engulfing the U.S. industrial sector,'' said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said groundbreaking activity on new housing projects fell 3.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.099 million units last month. Starts dropped in the Northeast, which was blanketed by snowstorms last month, and also tumbled in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits dipped 0.2 percent to a 1.202 million-unit rate last month. Permits remain above starts, indicating that building activity will rebound in the coming months. In addition, housing market fundamentals remain strong, with a tightening labor market starting to push up wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We continue to believe that the housing market will be one of the bright spots for the domestic economy in 2016,'' said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina, ''reflecting stronger job growth, increased household formations and the current paucity of supply, particularly in the new-home market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the Labor Department said its producer price index edged up 0.1 percent in January as the cost of services increased, after slipping 0.2 percent in December. In the 12 months through January, the index decreased 0.2 percent, after declining 1 percent in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in services was led by a 4 percent gain in margins for machinery and equipment. There were also increases in prices related to securities brokerage and dealing, loan services and apparel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But energy prices fell 5 percent after sliding 3.5 percent in December. Wholesale food prices rose 1 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEWARK -- For the past week, on a block of North 13th Street just past the Morris &amp; Essex Line tracks in this tumbledown city, the air has been full of diesel fuel and promise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 48 North 13th Street, or what is left of it, Gilbert Gomez directed his brother Leonardo, who sat behind the wheel of a roaring backhoe, scooping masses of sienna-colored earth into the air. Another brother, Geovany, gave the signal when the bucket was over the small dump truck they had rented to cart away the dirt as they dug a foundation for their new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is what we came here for, to build a better life,'' Gilbert Gomez said, standing amid the discarded cups from Popeyes, plastic shopping bags and concrete chunks that littered the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brothers, dreamers from Ecuador, were bundled against the near-freezing cold. They had ventured out in almost the same conditions a year ago to secure the 25-foot-by-100-foot lot when Newark held a highly publicized land sale on Valentine's Day. Hundreds of couples -- any pairing would do -- lined up for a chance to buy one of 98 vacant lots for $1,000. The Gomezes, who already lived in the city and worked in construction, arrived around 2 a.m. and were already 48th in line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now they are first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While city officials initially thought construction would be underway on most homes at this point, the Gomez brothers are the only people in the program who have broken ground. For many, a deal that seemed too good to be true has turned out to be exactly that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newark remains undeterred, and on Sunday, it unveiled a new phase of the project in time for Cupid's return: The city will now team up with about half the couples from the program to build a house for them, which they would then buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new plan is intended to remove obstacles that have slowed the process, including designing a home, getting permits or, most challenging of all, finding a bank willing to provide not just a mortgage but a construction loan in one of the most depressed real estate markets in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We learned that people want this, they are hungry for it,'' Baye Adofo-Wilson, the deputy mayor for economic and housing development, said at City Hall last week. ''We just have to make sure they have the capacity to build a home, and if not, we will help them do the rest.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While so-called urban homesteading programs are not uncommon, they typically involve buyers' fixing up abandoned properties, not building new ones from scratch. With at least 2,000 vacant lots, Newark was eager to experiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the program, buyers are required to live in the homes for five years and will receive a five-year tax abatement. As they rebuild, properties would be knit back into the community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, even as the city continues to recover from the 1967 riots and the urban blight that followed, the challenges of the Valentine's Day sale showed that innovation was not always enough to get the job done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LaToya Davis, a nursing assistant from Irvington, N.J., believes that if not for a loan from the <span class="companylink">Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, thanks to her husband's service in the <span class="companylink">United States Army</span>, they could not afford to build a house in the Weequahic neighborhood of Newark. ''Everything in life is a gamble, so you have to take your chances,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It does not help that some homes surrounding the lots were not in the best shape. One of the two next to the Gomezes' lot has been abandoned for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-one Valentine's buyers returned their lots within a month or two, including Annette Newton, who lives in neighboring East Orange and was 113th in line on the day of the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was one of the last lots available, and the location turned out to be pretty run-down,'' Ms. Newton said. ''I still thinks it's great what they're doing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who moved forward were less frustrated with the city than with the banks that all but ignored their inquiries -- sometimes with good reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average Newark home sold for $150,000 in 2015, an 18 percent increase from three years earlier, but less than half the price fetched in 2006, according to RealtyTrac, an online real estate data firm. And foreclosures are on the rise, reaching 2,469, or one in 47 homes, last year, a level not seen since 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most couples have been expecting to spend between $250,000 and $350,000 to build their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The good thing is, the city didn't just do this for all the hoopla, and then forgot about these people,'' said Arnold Cohen, senior policy coordinator for the Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey. ''They are in it for the long haul, to solve these problems.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the Gomezes, four couples have closed on their properties and are finishing their financing. An additional 18 had their permits approved but have been unable so far to secure construction loans. Despite her connections as a real estate agent, Christina Coaker and her fiancée, Bern Woods, have tried every major bank and are now turning to a private one for the two-family, loft-style home they plan to build in the North Ward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We drive by pretty regularly, so it's fresh in our mind and we don't give up on it,'' Ms. Coaker, who lives with Ms. Woods in a condominium in Jersey City, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homesteaders have been delayed by circumstances. Jacqueline Machado was six months pregnant when she joined her husband in line. The birth of their twins made the Brazilian couple, who live in the Ironbound neighborhood, wait until this year to begin planning. John Errico, a start-up founder, and his wife, Shannon Guy, a lawyer, had already renovated two homes in Union City, N.J. But when his father, who lives in Florida, found out he had cancer, it caused a re-evaluation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a little difficult to justify a $300,000-plus expenditure on a new home when pre-existing homes in the area on similar lots can be had for less than $100,000,'' Mr. Errico said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a reason Mr. Adofo-Wilson is now urging people to consider building more affordable single-family homes that can cost as little as $179,000 with the city's help (most participants prefer two-family homes for the rental income). The Newark Community Economic Development Corporation hopes the remaining 54 couples who have made little progress will work with its selected contractors to begin building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the homes may not be there yet, the real goal -- getting more people to want to live in Newark -- may have succeeded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Since we've done this, we've had people in here every day asking for lots,'' Mr. Adofo-Wilson said. ''I think if we had another Valentine's Day sale this Sunday, we'd have had another 400 or 500 people out there. Whatever kinks we had in the system, we'll get rid of them, and then maybe we can do it again next year.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of new single-family homes in the United States surged in December to their highest level in 10 months, the latest indication that the housing sector remained on firmer footing despite a huge stock market sell-off and slowing economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that sales last month rose 10.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 544,000 units, the highest level since February. December sales were most likely buoyed by unseasonably mild weather and a rise in the supply of homes on the market, which increased choices for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a promising sign for the housing market as we move into 2016,'' said Tian Liu, chief economist at Genworth Mortgage Insurance in Raleigh, N.C. ''We expect the strong increase in new-home sales to continue as the fundamentals in the housing market remain strong and newer vintage homes are in short supply.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales soared 14.5 percent, to 501,000 units in 2015, the highest level since 2007. Housing is being supported by tightening labor market conditions, which are spurring a rise in household formation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report last week showed a record increase in home resales in December from a 19-month low in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A firmer housing sector should put a floor under the economy, which has been battered by the headwinds of a strong dollar, spending cuts by energy firms stung by lower oil prices and sluggish global demand. Efforts by businesses to whittle down an inventory bloat have also been a drag on growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market sell-off, which has brought a plunge in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index this month, is also adding to the pain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is scheduled to report on Friday that fourth-quarter gross domestic product increased at a 0.8 percent annual rate, according to a Reuters survey of economists, slowing sharply from the third quarter's 2 percent rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, new-home sales jumped 20.8 percent in the Northeast and gained 0.4 percent in the populous South. They advanced 31.6 percent in the Midwest and shot up 21.0 percent in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of new homes on the market rose to 237,000 units last month, from 231,000 units in November. At December's sales pace it would take 5.2 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.6 months in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home fell 4.3 percent from a year ago to $288,900.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home prices in the United States increased at a faster clip in November, propelled by solid hiring growth, low mortgage rates and a shortage of houses on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5.8 percent from a year ago, after a 5.5 percent pace in October, according to a report on Tuesday. Also Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said consumer confidence rose in January, from December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values nationwide have nearly recovered from their July 2006 peak, as the real estate market has slowly recovered from the housing crash that set off the recession. But several metro areas have fully rebounded from the downturn. Four of them -- Dallas, Denver, San Francisco and Portland, Ore. -- have either matched or eclipsed their highs. And Charlotte, N.C., is less than 1 percent below its previous high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers crowded back into the housing market last year. Sales of existing homes rose 6.5 percent over the past year, to 5.26 million, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. More Americans have been able to buy homes as employers have added 2.7 million jobs and borrowing costs remain low. But the number of available listings has fallen 3.8 percent from a year ago, causing tight inventories that have sent prices up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising home values and limited selection could ultimately deter sales growth in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The dearth of inventory has really taken its toll on the market,'' said Nela Richardson, chief economist at the brokerage firm Redfin. ''Home buyers this year are motivated but not desperate, and they refuse to overpay. Without more listings, what we'll see are higher prices and lower sales volumes, a lousy way to start a new year for home buyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenges caused by rising home values have been offset by falling mortgage rates in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage buyer <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 3.81 percent last week, from 3.92 percent a week earlier. Rates have historically averaged 6 percent, meaning that interest expenses are relatively low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong job market, as well as low gasoline prices, helped bolster Americans' confidence again this month, with the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> saying that its consumer confidence index rose to 98.1, from 96.3 in December, the second consecutive monthly gain. The business research group said Americans were more confident about the future, though their assessment of current economic conditions was unchanged from December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers shrugged off the recent sharp decline in the stock market and signs of economic weakness overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The increase is rather surprising given the volatility in equities in the month,'' Derek Lindsey, an economist at BNP Paribas, wrote in a research note. ''A resilient labor market and low gasoline and utilities prices seem to have offset any negative sentiment stemming from financial markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market has been rattled by the impact of China's persistent economic slowdown and a plunge in the prices of commodities, including oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said 6.6 percent of survey respondents planned to buy a house in the next six months, the highest percentage since December 2013.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home resales rebounded strongly in December from a 19-month low and prices surged, indicating that the housing market recovery remained intact, while a separate report hinted at some stabilization for the downtrodden manufacturing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Friday that existing-home sales jumped a record 14.7 percent to an annual rate of 5.46 million units, after being temporarily held back by the introduction of new mortgage disclosure rules, which had caused delays in the closing of contracts in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were also helped by unseasonably warm weather and buyers rushing into the market in anticipation of higher mortgage rates. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December, the first rate increase in nearly a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We knew a significant number of closings were delayed by new regulations that came into effect in October. Over all, 2015 was a very good year and we're positioned for a strong spring market,'' said Stephen Phillips, president of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage disclosure rules are intended to help homebuyers understand their loan options and shop around for loans suited to their financial circumstances. Realtors said the rules had significantly increased the time needed to close a contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November's sales pace was unrevised at 4.76 million units. Economists had forecast home resales rebounding 8.9 percent to an annual rate of 5.2 million in December. Sales rose 6.5 percent to 5.26 million units in 2015, the strongest since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a different report, the data firm Markit said its Purchasing Managers Index bounced back in early January from December's 38-month low as output and new business volumes increased at faster rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect output and employment growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector to remain tepid,'' said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays Capital in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak reports on retail sales, inventories, exports and industrial production have left economists estimating that gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in the fourth quarter after expanding at a 2 percent pace in the July-September quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A stock market rout has also added to the gloom over the economy. In a third report, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said its leading indicators slipped in December after a drop in building permits and persistently weak new factory orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is being supported by a strengthening labor market, which has resulted in an acceleration in household formation. Sales, however, remain constrained by a dearth of homes available for sale, which is limiting choice for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the number of unsold homes on the market tumbled 12.3 percent from November to 1.79 million units, the lowest level since January 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At December's sales pace, it would take 3.9 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, the fewest since January 2005, and down from 5.1 months in November. A six-months supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With inventories still tight, the median house price jumped 7.6 percent from a year ago to $224,100. House prices increased 6.7 percent in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although higher prices could sideline potential buyers, especially those wanting to purchase a home for the first time, they are boosting equity for homeowners, which could encourage them to put their homes on the market.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Consumer prices unexpectedly fell in December as the cost of gasoline dropped and rents rose moderately — all signs of weak inflation that could indicate that the Federal Reserve[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/federal_reserve_system/index.html?inline=nyt-org] won’t raise interest rates in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data on Wednesday showed a drop in housing starts and building permits last month. The latest reports follow weaker numbers on retail sales, industrial production, exports, inventory and manufacturing surveys. All indicators suggest that there was a significant slowdown in economic growth at the end of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against the backdrop of renewed weakness in oil prices, which touched new lows on Wednesday, economists say the expected reversion to the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target is slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The broad-based nature of the decline in inflation will hardly be encouraging news at the Fed, and if anything it is likely to temper their confidence in the outlook for inflation,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/consumer_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] slipped 0.1 percent after being unchanged in November. Despite that drop, the C.P.I. increased 0.7 percent in the 12 months through December, the biggest rise in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast that the index would remain unchanged last month and rise 0.8 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The so-called core C.P.I., which strips out food and energy costs, edged up 0.1 percent in December after advancing 0.2 percent in each of the previous three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12 months through December, the core C.P.I. increased 2.1 percent, the largest gain since July 2012. The Fed tracks a price measure that is running well below the core C.P.I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, gasoline tumbled 3.9 percent after falling 2.4 percent in November. Food prices[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/food_prices/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] fell for a second straight month as meat, poultry, fish and egg prices posted their biggest declines since August 1979.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gain in the core C.P.I. was kept in check by moderate increases in rents and medical care costs. Rents rose 0.2 percent after a similar gain in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in rental prices signals the loss of economic momentum, said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research in New York. “That momentum moved millennials off of their parent’s couch and onto their own, but momentum may no longer be strong enough to put the same upward pressure on rents,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Medical costs edged up 0.1 percent, slowing from a 0.4 percent rise in November. The costs of doctor visits were unchanged after jumping 1.1 percent the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong dollar as well as an inventory bloat is damping prices for some core goods. Apparel prices declined for a fourth straight month, while prices for new motor vehicles dipped 0.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts dropped 2.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.15 million units as groundbreaking on both single- and multifamily projects fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact of unseasonably warm weather was probably offset by heavy rains in some parts of the country. Starts rose 10.3 percent last year to their highest level since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits declined 3.9 percent to a 1.23 million-unit rate in December, pulled down by an 11.4 percent plunge in permits for multifamily buildings. Permits for the construction of single-family homes rose 1.8 percent last month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investment partnership sold a gut-renovated early-20th-century townhouse on a prime, tree-lined street in Greenwich Village for $23,282,932.60, more than twice what it had paid for the property just over two years ago -- a transaction that was the most expensive closed sale of the week, according to city records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nearly 23-foot-wide Greek Revival brick building at 146 Waverly Place, built in 1905 and with a classic front stoop, was a vacant eight-unit apartment house when Robert Kaliner of Ascend Builders and his business partner, Jeffrey Davidson of West Orange, N.J., bought it for $10.2 million in December 2013. They returned it to a single residence, investing about $6.5 million more over 21 months in a top-to-bottom renovation that included numerous updates and an addition on the below-ground level, Mr. Kaliner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was demoed and built from the ground up -- the only thing left were the front and side walls,'' he said, adding, ''It wasn't architecturally beautiful. It was a pretty crummy rental building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kaliner said that he and his partner initially attempted to resell the five-story property as ''a customizable townhouse'' (with a list price of $22 million, according to StreetEasy.com), but after a few months with no takers shifted strategy. ''People don't want to be involved in the whole construction-nightmare process, so we took it off the market,'' he explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the partnership created its own interior design for the 7,600-square-foot home, transforming it with the help of the architect Wayne Turett and Mr. Kaliner's building contracting business into a modern, light-filled house with high ceilings, high-end finishes, floor-to-ceiling windows and new mechanical systems throughout. There is also ample outdoor space, totaling around 2,000 square feet, including terraces on the third and fourth floors; a roof deck with an outdoor kitchen; and a meticulously landscaped rear garden, also with a kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our vision was to build something that was classic with a contemporary feel to it,'' Mr. Kaliner said. ''It's hard when you're building a house on spec to pick something that everyone loves. We made sure this house was built the way it should be built.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are seven bedrooms, six full baths and two powder rooms, along with a formal dining room and kitchen on the garden level, and two large living rooms, one with a marble fireplace, on the parlor floor. An elegant entry vestibule was created with a glass wall divider. All the floors are connected by a sculptural stairway and elevator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The master suite, on the third floor, features a limestone-clad fireplace, large closets and an enormous en-suite marble bath. There is also a small terrace as well as a study and a dressing room. The fourth level has a large family room or bedroom suite with a terrace overlooking the garden, and two additional bedrooms, one of which has an en-suite bath; the fifth level includes another large bedroom suite and two smaller bedrooms as well as a laundry room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skylights were added to the basement, which has exercise and recreation rooms, a wet bar and a full bath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leonard Steinberg of Compass, who listed the property along with his colleagues Hervé Senequier, Calli Sarkesh and Amy Mendizabal, said there were multiple offers for the house, which has annual taxes of $63,209.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The successful bidder, whose identity was hidden under the limited liability company Waverly 146, was from the New York area, according to Mr. Kaliner. Sarah Fearon of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> represented the buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.</p>

</div><div class="author">By MICHELLE HIGGINS   </div><div>1591 words</div><div>17 January 2016</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City real estate continues to sell for astronomical prices, but there are signs the market is heading back toward earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding wars, brokers say, are less frequent. Few open houses have lines out the door. And asking prices, while still lofty, are increasingly moving down, especially for luxury properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have seen more broker incentives and price reductions in the last few months than I've seen in the last three years combined,'' said Leonard Steinberg, the president of the real estate brokerage firm Compass. ''The market got carried away with itself in the first half of 2015. Some people went in with crazy pricing expectations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last four months of 2015, about 1,040 available listings in Manhattan cut their asking prices, said Bennett Rosnick, an analyst at Compass. That's 20 percent of the roughly 5,120 properties on the market then, up from nearly 10 percent during the same period of the previous year, when about 520 properties out of some 5,380 available listings had price cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the discounted listings circulated by brokers and publicists in recent weeks: ''$7 Million Price Drop!!'' for a five-bedroom at 110 Central Park South, listed for $17.995 million; ''1 Million PRICE REDUCTION!'' for a three-bedroom penthouse at 15 West 20th Street, listed for $7 million; ''HOT DEAL. *$150K Price DROP*'' for a one-bedroom at 280 Park Avenue South asking nearly $1.4 million; ''PRICE REDUCED'' by $14 million in November, and further reduced by a total $18.5 million, for a historic townhouse at 684 Park Avenue, listed for $29.5 million. And the list goes on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the all-caps discounts, there are few real bargains. Most of the reductions are coming off price tags that were too high in the first place, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is never a market for overpriced listings,'' said Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens. ''If you haven't had offers or are not getting the proper amount of showings, the market is telling you there is not interest, and you have to reduce the price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the problem, brokers say, is that record-setting deals at the top of the market have received so much attention that many sellers are shooting for the stars. ''You can have a huge divide between what sellers of existing properties for resale expect to get and pricing of properties for brand-new buildings like 432 Park or One57,'' said Mr. Steinberg of Compass. The thinking is, ''If I can see that building from my window, surely mine should cost the same or close,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, that's not how it works.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the art of property pricing, size, location, condition and features like outdoor space, prewar character and other details come into play. Then, the property must be compared with what nearby homes with similar attributes have sold for. If a property is priced too ambitiously, brokers say, that will quickly become clear when it is placed on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some sellers don't get the message right away. ''It's almost like the boyfriend or the girlfriend who stops calling,'' said Mr. Willkie of Brown Harris Stevens. '' 'They didn't tell me they didn't like me anymore,' '' he said, quoting the jilted. ''Well, no, but they didn't call you.'' In real estate, he said, ''it's the same thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loath to resort to discounts, some developers and high-end brokers are quietly ratcheting up commissions and other incentives they offer real estate agents to try to increase sales. The Oosten, a 216-unit condominium in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which began sales more than a year ago, is offering a $5,000 <span class="companylink">American Express</span> gift card to brokers who can deliver a signed contract for one of its 78 remaining units, listed for $1.14 million for a one-bedroom to $6.42 million for a six-bedroom penthouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, 200 East 62nd Street, a 115-unit condominium conversion that began sales earlier last year, introduced a $10,000 broker bonus for one-bedroom deals closed by the end of December, $20,000 for two-bedrooms and $30,000 for three-bedrooms. In Midtown, a new 93-unit condominium at 252 East 57th Street, which topped out in October, began offering brokers a 1 percent commission within 60 days of a signed contract -- even if the buyer does not ultimately close. Normally, brokers aren't paid until a sale officially closes, which can take as long as two years in developments under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're doing this to try to raise awareness among brokers who have not been to the building,'' said Steven Rutter, the director of Stribling Marketing Associates, which is handling sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the increase in price reductions, industry experts say the market remains strong. ''If a property is worth $1 million and you ask $1.4 million and reduce it to $1.3 million, it's not an indication of a problem in the market,'' said Mr. Willkie of Brown Harris Stevens. ''It's a problem with overpricing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales remain robust for the bulk of the market, with competition particularly heated for two-bedrooms, where there are still too few apartments to go around. It's the high end where sales volume has begun to slow. ''We still see interesting things happening, including record-setting prices closing,'' said Michael Graves, an associate broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>. ''There just happens to be a lot more uber-luxury product coming to market.'' As a result, he said, ''buyers are much more patient, and some of the exuberance we saw last year has faded away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, 189 apartments were sold for $10 million or more in 2015, down nearly 12 percent from the record 214 in 2014, according to CityRealty, which tracks co-op and condo sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Donna Olshan, a broker who keeps track of contracts of $4 million or more, said sales volume has become ''erratic'' at the high end. ''September was lousy, October was worse,'' she said, citing a total of 153 contracts signed at prices of $4 million or more, compared with 216 for the same period last year. November rallied with 140 contracts signed, versus 124 in November 2014. But December was back down. ''Over all, the market is not what it was,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaun Osher, the founder and chief executive of the brokerage firm CORE, calls the situation ''the tale of two markets,'' adding, ''We're seeing an incredible dichotomy in the market, where certain projects are selling better and quicker and for higher prices than ever seen in history, and there are projects where very little is happening.'' What that shows, he said, ''is that the fundamentals of real estate are starting to come back into play.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spate of new luxury condominiums is creating more competition for sellers at the top. In Manhattan, there were 3,513 unsold new-development units in the third quarter of 2015, up from 2,402 in that same quarter in 2014, according to the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. And more units are coming down the pike: An estimated 5,740 apartments across some 140 buildings are expected to come to market next year in Manhattan alone, most of which are aimed at the high end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with more options, luxury shoppers can afford to be choosier. ''Buyers are in less of a rush and they're coming back two, three, four times,'' said Mr. Rutter of Stribling, noting that sales at 252 East 57th Street have been strong for apartments $8 million or less, but less robust for units priced at $10 million or more. ''Whenever they have more choices, it's a little bit more difficult.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To spur sales, nine five-bedroom apartments that were listed for $10 million and up are being reduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, Douglas C. Yearley Jr., the chief executive of Toll Brothers, told investors in a December conference call that the company planned ''to be a bit more aggressive in pricing'' for the remaining units at 400 Park Avenue South, an 81-unit condominium in NoMad designed by Christian de Portzamparc. Prices have been slashed for 16 of the remaining units, which range from a nearly $1.9 million one-bedroom, down from $2.28 million, to a $12.9 million penthouse, down from nearly $17 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have also come down roughly 10 percent at 1110 Park Avenue, a nine-unit limestone condominium on the Upper East Side, which has five remaining units available, from an $8 million three-bedroom to a $31.5 million five-bedroom penthouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes to asking prices for remaining units are being made ''through price amendments'' and ''one-off negotiations with buyers,'' said David von Spreckelsen, the president of Toll Brothers City Living, New York. ''In a market where there is more supply, you really need to do everything right.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan real estate, 2015 was a year for the record books, with the median price for co-ops and condos hitting a new high of $1.15 million in the final months of the year, according to reports by major real estate firms that will be released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong overall sales led by big-ticket closings in new developments drove prices to new highs. And by the end of the year, it was more expensive than ever to buy a Manhattan apartment, by many measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average sales price also hit a new high of nearly $2 million during the fourth quarter of 2015, boosted by sales of ultraluxury apartments in new developments, including deals that were penned as long as two years ago but only closed in the last few months, as the buildings neared completion. The price per square foot also set a record, at $1,645, according to a report from <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was an extraordinary year,'' said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, which reported a jump in the median sales price for new development to $2.24 million -- yet another record. ''But 2015 still held a lot of frustration for buyers wanting apartments at a reasonable price,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With too few listings to satisfy buyer demand, sellers had the upper hand in 2015, but there were signs that a shift was beginning to emerge. Signed contracts were down 12 percent year-over-year, to less than 3,000 deals, according to Corcoran. While prices remained high across all market segments, the average sales price for new developments dropped 17 percent, to $3.25 million, in the last three months of the year, from $3.92 million in the same period of 2014. And the average price for the luxury market, defined as the top 10 percent of closed sales, fell 15 percent, to $6.85 million, in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with $8 million in the same period in 2014, according to Corcoran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After stagnating at low levels for much of 2015, inventory jumped 14 percent, to 5,060 available listings, in the fourth quarter, compared with the same period a year ago, according to the Corcoran report. But the fresh supply has come mainly from new buildings aimed at the ultrawealthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The increased supply on the high end has taken some of the urgency out of the market,'' Ms. Liebman said, ''yet the low end is still suffering from not enough product at achievable price points.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She noted that while 14 percent of all sales were priced at $500,000 or less in the fourth quarter, only 8 percent of inventory fell within that price point. By contrast, available listings priced at $5 million or more made up 20 percent of the inventory in the fourth quarter, and just 7 percent of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartments in new developments made up 18.6 percent of sales in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with 10 percent in the same quarter a year ago, according to the <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> report. That is still significantly less than in 2006, before the financial crisis began, when new development made up about half of the market, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. ''Over the next year or two we're going to see this continued rising volume of new development closings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New development is expected to continue to influence prices as major deals signed this year have yet to officially close and be reflected in city records. But with more inventory expected to enter the market, buyers can afford to be choosier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing buyers definitely willing to sit on the sidelines,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">Halstead Property</span>. ''Anything priced overly aggressively has to be addressed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buyers have more of a reason to push back than they did in the last boom because credit has not eased,'' said Mr. Miller of Miller Samuel and the author of the <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> report, which found that the market share of all sales that sold at or above the asking price was 47.9 percent, short of the prior quarter record high of 53.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As we go into 2016,'' Ms. Liebman said, ''there's going to be very definite winners and losers.'' Developers, she said, ''need to be building a great product that is differentiated from other properties on the market and is coming on at the right price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite stirrings of resistance, brokerage firm executives expect the market to remain strong in 2016. ''I think you'll see sustainable growth,'' said Dottie Herman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. ''I don't know that it will go up double digits, but it will go up in a healthy way and that's what you want. Too fast, too quick, too soon, and it's bound to fall again at some point.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contracts to buy previously owned homes fell in November for the third time in four months, a signal that growth in the housing market could be cooling. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Wednesday that its pending home sales index slipped 0.9 percent to 106.9. The group added that the index had risen slightly more in October than initially estimated. Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and the declines in recent months could point to slower growth in home-buying in 2016. Mortgage rates have only inched higher since the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> raised its benchmark rate by a quarter point on Dec. 16, but Fed policy makers expect to continue the increases next year. Pending home sales had been posting strong gains earlier in the year and were still up 2.7 percent from a year ago. But contracts fell 3 percent in the Northeast in November from a month earlier and were down 5.5 percent in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> They rose 1.3 percent in the South and gained 1.0 percent in the Midwest.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steady job growth, low mortgage rates and tight inventories helped spur rising home prices in October, and a stronger job market lifted consumer confidence in December, separate reports showed on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Standard &amp; Poor’s/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index [https://www.spice-indices.com/idpfiles/spice-assets/resources/public/documents/282559_cshomeprice-release-1229.pdf?force_download=true] rose 5.5 percent in the 12 months ending in October, up from a 5.4 percent pace in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values have climbed at a roughly 5 percent pace during much of 2015, as strong hiring has bolstered a real estate market still recovering from a housing crash that led to a recession eight years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The U.S. housing market as a whole made great progress in 2015, as the big and occasionally volatile bounce off the bottom we experienced from 2012 through 2014 gave way to a more stable and sustainable environment,” said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at the real estate firm Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising demand, however, has not been met with an increase in sales listings, causing prices to rise much faster than inflation or wages this year. This could limit the number of first-time buyers coming into the market next year. Still, many buyers are also benefiting from 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaging less than 4 percent, making it cheaper to borrow for a home. Mortgage rates have historically been closer to 6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the gains in home prices have been uneven. San Francisco, Denver and Portland, Ore., led with reported increases of 10.9 percent over the last year. Prices in Chicago and Washington, D.C., rose less than 2 percent. The 20-city index remains 11.5 percent below its peak in July 2006, with metro areas such as Cleveland, Detroit, Miami, Minneapolis and Tampa still significantly below their pre-recession highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index covers roughly half of the homes in the United States. The index measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index [https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm] rose to 96.5 this month from November’s revised 92.6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans were more optimistic about current conditions and about the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As 2015 draws to a close, consumers’ assessment of the current state of the economy remains positive, particularly their assessment of the job market,” said Lynn Franco, the group’s director of economic indicators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than two-thirds of consumers said they expected interest rates to rise over the next year, the highest share since August 2013. On Dec. 16, the Federal Reserve raised the short-term interest rate [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/business/economy/fed-interest-rates.html] it controls for the first time since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hiring has been healthy in 2015. Employers added an average of 210,000 jobs a month through November. Unemployment has stayed at a seven-year low of 5 percent for two straight months. Confidence had dipped unexpectedly in November and this month remained below readings around 100 from August through October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“U.S. consumers regained a bit of their swagger in December,” Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a research report. She noted that confidence rebounded the most among young households — those headed by someone younger than 35 — potentially a sign that more first-time home buyers were ready to enter the housing market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buying in 2016 will remain challenging for many borrowers. But the market should look closer to normal, as more homeowners who had been stuck underwater reach the surface and more first-time buyers find their financial footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some predictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME PRICE APPRECIATION WILL SLOW. Industry experts expect home prices to continue to rise in 2016, but at a slower pace, somewhere between 3 percent and 4.5 percent nationally. In the expensive coastal markets, like New York and San Francisco, prices had been rising much more quickly, but that trend is not sustainable, said Ralph McLaughlin, a housing economist for the real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are approaching a critical threshold on the costly coasts where the median household would have to spend 40 percent or more on the median-priced house,'' he said. ''That's a signal that households will not rush to buy homes because affordability is pushing down on their ability to do so.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. McLaughlin predicted that sales would likely pick up in more affordable metropolitan areas that are also experiencing job growth, such as San Antonio and Austin, Tex.; Grand Rapids, Mich.; and Baton Rouge, La.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYING WILL STILL BEAT RENTING. The expected rise in mortgage rates -- by a half to a full percentage point by the end of the year -- will not wipe out the financial advantage to buying over renting in the largest metro markets. The exceptions will be the costliest markets, mainly in California, where a rate rise to 4.5 percent or 4.75 percent could put home buying on par with the cost of renting, Mr. McLaughlin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates may also dissuade some would-be sellers from putting homes on the market, continuing to starve markets hungry for inventory. ''Some owners have refinanced at the lowest rates humanly possible, and they may be unwilling to give up that mortgage,'' said Nela Richardson, the chief economist for Redfin, a real estate brokerage. ''I think the biggest risk for the 2016 market is lack of inventory.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE MIX OF BUYERS WILL CHANGE. For the last few years, the buyer makeup has been somewhat ''distorted,'' Ms. Richardson said. ''We've had a lot of investors in the market, and a smaller share of first-time buyers, at around 32 percent,'' she said. That will change next year, she said, as the era of big bargains for single-family investors comes to a close and the ranks of first-timers grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She noted that families that have been shut out of the mortgage market could be helped by some new government initiatives, like <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>'s HomeReady program, which will allow borrowers to qualify using income from other household members not listed on the mortgage or from non-occupant co-borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, while the credit pendulum ''is still swung on the side of being tight, and arguably too tight,'' first-time buyers are responding to the reduction in insurance premiums on mortgages backed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, which require as little as 3.5 percent down, said Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist of Realtor.com, a real estate listing site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SPRING MARKET COULD HIT IN WINTER. Spurred by the expected rise in interest rates, buyers may come out earlier in the year than usual, maybe even in January and February, Ms. Richardson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smoke agreed that a ''crazy spring market'' could be in the offing. ''Rates are going up, and buyers have seen prices rising and will want to get in before they go up higher,'' he said. ''And the third factor is, what's the alternative? Renting is becoming increasingly expensive.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New orders for capital goods fell in November and the previous month's increase was revised sharply lower as the strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector showed few signs of abating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the outlook for the economy remains encouraging, with other data on Wednesday showing consumer sentiment at a five-month high in December and personal income rising for an eighth straight month in November. That should support consumer spending and generate enough economic growth for the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to raise interest rates steadily next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The economy is not too cold and not too hot; it is just right. The Fed can stay the course,'' said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at the MUFG Union Bank in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- a closely watched proxy for business spending plans -- dropped 0.4 percent in November. The figure for October for these so-called core capital goods was revised down to a 0.6 percent increase, from a 1.3 percent rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy, is also being hurt by business efforts to reduce inventory bloat and sluggish global demand. The dollar has gained almost 20 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners over the last 18 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey this month showed manufacturing contracted in November for the first time in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unless we see a big rebound in December or upward revisions, it appears that investment in equipment contracted in the fourth quarter,'' said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>'s consumer sentiment index increased to 92.6 this month, the highest reading since July. Low inflation, characterized by deep discounts at shopping malls, accounted for the rise in sentiment this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospects for consumer spending next year also got a lift from another report from the Commerce Department, showing income increased 0.3 percent last month, after gaining 0.4 percent in October. Wages and salaries advanced 0.5 percent, adding to a 0.6 percent gain in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tightening labor market, marked by a jobless rate that is in a range some Fed officials consider consistent with full employment, is starting to lift wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.4 percent in the 12 months through November, the largest increase since December, after increasing 0.2 percent in October. Excluding food and energy, the so-called core index rose 1.3 percent in the 12 months through November, for the 11th straight month. It is the Fed's preferred inflation measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's <span class="companylink">Bureau of Economic Analysis</span> inadvertently released part of the consumption portion of its report late Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other indicators suggested some loss of momentum in the housing market. Sales of new single-family homes in November rose less than expected and the previous month's increase was revised down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that sales increased 4.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 490,000 units. October's sales pace was revised down to 470,000 units from the previously reported 495,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.3 percent of the housing market, rising to a rate of 505,000 units last month. Sales were up 9.1 percent compared with November of last year.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Housing starts in November rebounded from a seven-month low, and permits surged to a five-month high, signs of strength in the housing market as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> starts to raise interest rates after years of easy monetary policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data released on Wednesday showed the industrial sector continuing to struggle under the weight of a strong dollar, cuts in inventory investment and spending reductions by energy companies in response to persistently low oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its housing report, the Commerce Department said that groundbreaking jumped 10.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.17 million units last month. Building permits rose 11 percent to a 1.29 million-unit rate, the highest since June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With permits exceeding starts, home building is likely to remain supported in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed on Wednesday raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points from near zero, the first rate increase in nearly a decade. It gave an upbeat assessment of the economy and noted that ''the housing sector has improved further.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed made clear that the tightening cycle was likely to be gradual, so the increase in borrowing costs was not expected to upset the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The interest rate is still low compared to historical standards,'' said Kevin Young, an analyst at IBISWorld in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Fed said industrial production fell 0.6 percent in November as unusually warm weather caused a sharp drop in demand for utilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third consecutive monthly decline in industrial output also reflected another sharp fall in mining production, driven by a plunge in drilling of oil and gas wells. Manufacturing output was unchanged. However, motor vehicle production fell for the first time since August, a worrying signal for manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect the auto sector to remain a drag on total production in coming months,'' said Laura Rosner, an economist at BNP Paribas in New York. ''On balance, manufacturing activity is likely to remain weak as the U.S. economy is still adjusting to the shocks of lower energy prices and weaker foreign demand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks were trading higher, and the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> home building index rallied. <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>, the largest American home builder, rose more than 2 percent in afternoon trading. <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, the nation's second-largest home builder, advanced 1.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November was the eighth straight month that housing starts remained above an annual pace of one million units, the longest stretch since 2007. Economists predict starts will average 1.1 million units for 2015, which would be the highest since 2007 and up from one million in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market recovery remains constrained by a persistent shortage of houses for sale. This has resulted in home prices rising faster than salaries, pushing more people toward renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Tight inventories and high prices will provide the incentives for builders to continue ramping up activity,'' said Gregory Daco, head of United States macroeconomics at Oxford Economics in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts, the largest segment of the market, increased 7.6 percent to a 768,000-unit pace. That was the highest reading since January 2008. Warm weather also probably increased activity. Groundbreaking on single-family houses rose in the South, Northeast and West, but fell in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts for the volatile multifamily segment surged 16.4 percent to a 405,000-unit pace. That segment has been the driver of residential construction but a shift toward single-family houses is expected in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Home builders are making progress addressing the shortage of newer vintage single-family homes we see in many markets, especially affordable housing products with a price of under $200,000,'' said Tian Liu, chief economist at Genworth Mortgage Insurance in Raleigh, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits to build single-family houses increased 1.1 percent last month to the highest level since December 2007. Multifamily building permits soared 26.9 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the Editor:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re ''Inequality and the City'' (column, Nov. 30):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It disappoints me (an ardent admirer) to see Paul Krugman accept the idea that ''land-use restrictions are the most likely culprit'' for recent residential housing price increases in places like New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers have pushed this view across a wide swath of the country, in good times and bad, in high-inflation localities and low-inflation localities. They contest restraints on the volume of what they can build, mitigations they must make on environmental grounds, or demands the authorities might make for infrastructural improvements (''linkages'').</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here's the problem with weakening restrictions: such a decrease makes land more valuable. That translates into higher site acquisition costs, offsetting -- by some significant degree -- whatever savings might otherwise have been passed on to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even talk of easing restriction, especially in regard to some specific parcels (as advocated for East Midtown under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, for example) itself risks an inflationary effect as would-be developers pencil in the larger expected payoffs when calculating how much they will pay for property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carried across the city, it can end up making more money for the already well invested (the 1 percent again) while doing nothing to lower housing costs or otherwise enhance public benefit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks closed modestly lower on Monday, as traders focused on early signs from the holiday shopping season and potential moves from the American and European central banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average lost 78.57 points, or 0.4 percent, to 17,719.92. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500 index lost 9.70 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,080.41 and the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite lost 18.86 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,108.67.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer discretionary stocks were among the biggest decliners, including the big department stores like <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> and Target. Initial data from the first holiday shopping weekend showed shoppers were not going to stores as much as last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preliminary data from <span class="companylink">ShopperTrak</span> showed in-store sales on Thanksgiving and Black Friday were $12.1 billion, down from $12.3 billion a year earlier. Yet the economic climate is relatively strong for shopping, including lower gas prices from a year ago and an improving job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe Black Friday has gone from a period of management excitement to one of anguish,'' the Nomura retail analysts Simeon Siegel, Gene Vladimirov and Julie Kim wrote in a note to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment bank analysts have said that department stores had to do deep discounting to attract shoppers to their stores. But data from research firms like <span class="companylink">ChannelAdvisor</span> showed strong growth in sales online, which could suggest consumers decided to spend online instead of in brick-and-mortar shops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer discretionary stocks fell 1 percent, compared with the 0.5 percent drop in the S.&amp;P. 500. Some of the more notable decliners were <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>, which fell 90 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $39.09, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>, which fell $1.04, or 1.7 percent, to $58.87 and <span class="companylink">Urban Outfitters</span>, which fell $1.25, or 5.3 percent, to $22.40. Even the online retail giant Amazon dropped $8.46, or 1.3 percent, to $664.80.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While it's too early to make the call about how 2015 holiday revenues (and margins) will unfold, our survey results for the Black Friday weekend don't add a lot of confidence for the broad retail landscape,'' Dave Weiner and Sindhu Chitturi, retail analysts for <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, wrote in a note to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, investors are also focused on this week's <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> meeting and the release of American jobs data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> is widely expected to give the region's economy another dose of stimulus as it tries to keep a recovery going and get inflation closer to 2 percent. The stimulus is likely to include increasing the amount banks have to pay to park money at the central bank, giving them an incentive to lend it instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> moves toward increasing stimulus, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> is getting ready to start raising interest rates for the first time since June 2006. A series of American economic reports this week, culminating with Friday's jobs survey for November, could cement investors' expectations for a rate hike at the Fed's next policy meeting in mid-December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unless this report is a total disaster, I think it's very, very likely the Fed is going to raise in December,'' said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at the <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Investment Institute</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy divergence between the two central banks has weighed on the euro and sent the dollar higher. On Monday the euro fell to $1.0572, its lowest level since April. It traded at $1.0591 late Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major American stock indexes ended November with slight gains. The S.&amp;P. 500 rose less than 0.1 percent and the Dow gained 0.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Monday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index rose 0.2 percent, to 107.7, last month. The index has increased 3.9 percent over the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures add to evidence that the housing market has lost some of its momentum after rapid sales growth this year. Healthy job gains and low mortgage rates lifted sales for much of the year. But rising home values and limited inventories have curtailed further growth in the closing months of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benchmark United States crude fell 6 cents, to $41.65 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, lost 25 cents to close at $44.61 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 3.2 cents, to $1.359 a gallon; heating oil fell 1.6 cents, to $1.337 a gallon; and natural gas rose 2.3 cents, to $2.235 per 1,000 cubic feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government bond prices did not move much. The yield on the 10-year <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> note edged down to 2.21 percent. The dollar rose to 123.12 yen from 122.85 yen late Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold rose $9.60 to $1,065.80 an ounce. Silver edged up 4 cents, to $14.05 an ounce, and copper edged down half a penny, to $2.04 a pound.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Slightly more Americans signed contracts to buy homes in October, a modest rebound after two prior monthly declines. The figures add to evidence that the housing market has lost some of its momentum after rapid sales growth earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index rose 0.2 percent, to 107.7, last month. The index has increased 3.9 percent over the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The data suggest that growth in home sales has slowed significantly," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Sullivan added, though, that because the reports are so volatile, it may be too early to jump to broader conclusions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Healthy job gains and low mortgage rates lifted sales for much of the year. But rising home values and limited inventories have limited further growth in the closing months of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors reported last week that completed sales had risen 3.9 percent from a year ago, even as buyers have fewer choices because the number of listings on the market has dropped 4.5 percent. A narrow selection of homes on the market has pushed up sales prices 5.8 percent from a year ago, to a median of $219,600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales are a barometer of future purchases. A lag of a month or two usually exists between a contract and a completed sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market had benefited from hiring that has cut unemployment to 5 percent, down from 5.7 percent a year ago. Average hourly earnings have improved 2.5 percent over the last year, a slight increase that has been enhanced by low inflation. But wage growth has failed to match the rise in home values, forcing more would-be home buyers to wait and save for a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower borrowing rates are also aiding sales. Mortgage rates remain well below their historic average of 6 percent. The average, 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 3.95 percent last week, according to the mortgage buyer <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market is still recovering more than six years after the end of the recession. Home sales have been uneven in different geographic regions. The number of signed contracts advanced in the Northeast and West, while dipping in the Midwest and South.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canyon Lake Ranch was once a playground for Christian day campers, and then was a corporate retreat with water-skiing, barbecues and cowboy shoot-’em-up shows. Hawks now circle above 108 sunbaked acres occupied by copperhead snakes, a few coyotes and the occasional construction truck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon this ranch will be a gated subdivision of 99 mini-mansions designed for buyers from mainland China. The developer, Zhang Long, a Beijing businessman, is keeping three plots to build his own estate along the site of an old rodeo arena.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This luxury development 35 miles northwest of Dallas is the latest frontier in a global buying phenomenon as Chinese money becomes a major force in real estate around the world. The flood of money is likely to persist despite the current tumult in China. While a currency devaluation and stock market crash have crimped the country’s buying power overseas, the resulting uncertainty is making many Chinese individuals and companies eager to invest anywhere except their home country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, Chinese investors are purchasing high-end apartments in wealthy neighborhoods and big skyscrapers in the financial district. In Canada, they are paying $1 million for modest Vancouver bungalows. In Australia, a Chinese sovereign wealth fund[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/sovereign_wealth_funds/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] bought nine office towers, one of the biggest real estate transactions in that nation’s history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States, the home-buying spree began on the coasts, where Chinese buyers snapped up luxury condos in Manhattan and McMansions in Silicon Valley, pushing up home values in big cities. It is now spreading to the middle of the country, where prices are more modest and have room to run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homes here in Corinth will feature two master suites, one for the buyers, the other for aging parents. A concierge service will help new arrivals from overseas order Internet service and pay electric bills. Chauffeurs will ferry homeowners until they learn to navigate the loops and spurs of Texas freeways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When Chairman Zhang saw the strength of the Texan economy, he decided it was time that the Asian community should be presented an opportunity to invest in the American Dream,” marketing materials for the development read.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The great property rush is part of the tidal wave of Chinese money that is pouring into the global economy and reshaping financial markets. In residential and commercial real estate, the new flow of cash is upending the traditional dynamics of buying and selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Chinese families represented for the first time the largest group of overseas home buyers in the United States. Big spenders on new homes are helping prop up local economies in the Midwest. But in dense areas like San Francisco and Manhattan, they are also affecting the affordability and availability of housing, as demand outpaces supply and bidding wars ensue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Chinese purchases make up a small sliver of overall sales in the United States, they have had a disproportionate impact on the market for more expensive properties, buying one in 14 homes sold for more than $1 million. On average, buyers from China, including the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong, pay $831,800 for a home, more than three times as much as Americans spend, according to a <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Chinese are buying homes purely as investments, capitalizing on surging rents in many parts of the United States. Others are trying to move their money beyond the reach of the Chinese government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many buyers have their children’s education in mind, picking up homes in good school districts or close to universities. At the upper echelon, the wealthy are hoping for green cards, joining with developers to take advantage of a federal program that fast-tracks them for residency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Du, a management and investment consultant from Beijing, was motivated by the potential for his family and his fortune. Over the last two years, he bought a townhouse — sight unseen — and two single-family homes in Northbrook, Ill., north of Chicago. He paid cash for all of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He plans to live in one, to give his children a chance to breathe cleaner air and learn at a better school than he could find in his hometown. He will rent out the other two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The price of property in Beijing is very high, the stock market is crashing, and the real economy is not stable,” Mr. Du said of the environment in China. “The people here have some money, but they don’t have enough good ways to invest their money.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Courting Buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Shanghai, not far from the banks of the Huangpu River, the offices of Windham Realty are tucked inside a glassy tower where the walls feature a poster of a development in Michigan: the Stonewater community on 366 acres in Northville, a suburb of Detroit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The most magnificent waterfront community and the most grand eco-redevelopment project in the U.S.,” the poster reads, highlighting six artificial lakes and 424 luxury villas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other posters of properties line the office space. Chic townhouses in San Diego. A golf course community in Fort Myers, Fla. Spacious homes in a Los Angeles development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eager to tap the new market of buyers, the American real estate firm has established two offices in China, first in Shanghai in 2007 and then last year in Beijing. It has attracted clients with events like traditional American Thanksgiving dinners and real estate showcases where Chinese film stars appear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The market is definitely larger and broader than when we started,” said Steven M. Lawson, the chief executive of Windham China. “They’re very different than the people we were working with in 2007. If we want to cut right to it, they’re less wealthy, a lot younger and a lot better educated from an international point of view.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is among many hoping to capture the wealth pouring out of China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese buyers spent $28.6 billion on American homes in the year ended in March, more than double their purchases two years before, according to the Realtors association. Chinese purchases in overseas commercial real estate jumped 49 percent last year, <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, a big real estate brokerage firm, has estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate deals follow a broader exodus of money from China to countries and companies around the world. An estimated $590 billion moved out of China in the 12 months through June, according to <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. And the amount of outflows most likely set a record in the third quarter, although detailed data will not be available until next month. In the past, they tended to stay under $200 billion a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The swell of funds from China represents the confluence of several big trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last six years, the Chinese government has kept the country awash with cash to stimulate the economy, which means a lot of extra money available to slosh abroad. The Chinese government has also made it easier for individuals to move large sums out of the country, as part of a broader liberalization of the nation’s heavily regulated financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is loosening the rules for corporations, too. Beijing now allows insurance companies to invest as much as 15 percent of their assets overseas, helping drive a surge in commercial purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese companies have been buying stakes in American trophy properties like the General Motors Building[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/nyregion/sell-of-minority-stake-in-gm-building-raises-its-value.html] and the Waldorf Astoria[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/chinese-return-to-the-waldorf-with-2-billion/] in New York. The situation is drawing comparisons to the 1980s, when Japanese companies invested heavily in American commercial real estate at premium prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the highflying deals may have only just begun. By the end of last year, Chinese insurers had only 1.44 percent of their money overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Chinese are deliberate; there will clearly be large capital flows coming to the West,” said Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group, the largest private landlord in the United States. “That will increase in frequency until the Chinese government decides it shouldn’t happen anymore — they’ve opened the spigot.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies are racing to develop services for Chinese customers. This year Zillow, the real estate search website, began publishing its database of American homes on a Chinese real estate site, Leju.com[http://Leju.com]. American real estate agents are advertising in local Chinese newspapers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the front lines are brokers in the Dallas suburbs like Roddy de la Garza, who arrives at homes with a video camera and a compass. The camera is for sharing video of house tours with his clients who live in China; the compass is to make sure the homes have a north-south alignment, to ensure proper energy flow in accordance with Chinese principles of feng shui.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve learned these things,” said Mr. de la Garza, who works for the realty firm Redfin, “so they trust me.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Boom in the Suburbs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, Scott Hogg, a Dallas real estate agent, helped a client bid on a home near the Plano-Frisco line for about $220,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bid from his client, who needed a mortgage, was rejected. The home went to a Chinese buyer who paid cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We lost out,” Mr. Hogg said. “It’s just this market. It’s insane.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For typical American home buyers who require mortgages, the influx of Chinese money makes it even more challenging in markets facing low inventory and rising prices. A majority of home purchases by Chinese buyers — 69 percent — are entirely cash, according to the Realtors association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such bids often rise to the top for sellers who can then close on a deal in little more than a weekend. Even in Silicon Valley, a market awash in millionaires, Chinese buyers — if they pay cash — can edge out tech entrepreneurs whose wealth is tied up in stock options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are even bidding wars between cash buyers now,” said Sam Van Horebeek, a director at East-West Property Advisors, a China-based firm that connects Chinese buyers with American real estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside the United States, the Chinese demand has been so great that some places are trying to temper it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong and Singapore have each imposed 15 percent taxes on nonresident buyers of residential real estate. In Australia, the state government of Victoria, which includes Melbourne, introduced a 3 percent tax on overseas buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some places are welcoming the economic activity. City coffers benefit from stronger property tax revenue. Many overseas arrivals are relatively wealthy, spending on new cars and furniture as well as everyday shopping and dining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interest from Chinese buyers is reshaping demographics in Texas. As the volume of Asian purchases grow, the number of Mexican buyers, historically the largest category from abroad, is leveling off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fast-growing Plano, a northern suburb, the number of people born in mainland China swelled to nearly 6,000 in 2010, from 3,600 in 2000 — and the group has since expanded. The area is such a popular destination that this spring <span class="companylink">American Airlines</span> began operating a direct flight to Beijing, the airline’s second nonstop from Dallas to a mainland Chinese city, after Shanghai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Corinth, a town of just 20,000, the development on the old ranch site is expected to bring hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in property taxes and fees. The average price of the new homes is $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The City Council unanimously approved the development in Corinth, where a Chicken Express and an <span class="companylink">AutoZone</span> abut a highway along the south side of town. Mr. Zhang’s company is planning a strip of luxury stores, including high-end restaurants, a spa and a wine shop that will sell bottles from a vineyard that the developer started just across the Oklahoma border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This will be a positive cash flow,” said Rick Chaffin, Corinth’s city manager. “I’d say it would be significant.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Dallas area, the current Chinese boom traces its roots to Taiwanese immigration in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then, <span class="companylink">Texas Instruments</span> was starting to make headway in the semiconductor business. The company had a strong presence first in Taiwan and later in mainland China, recruiting there for its operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As <span class="companylink">Texas Instruments</span> grew and the technology boom in America took off, students from China began arriving to study engineering in hopes of getting a job at the home office. The company hosted English classes for its new employees and cultural events to help them feel at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon a small strip of Chinese restaurants and an Asian market sprouted in Richardson, along with a community center offering a library of Chinese books, tai chi classes and country line dancing. In 2001, Huawei, a major Chinese telecom company, opened its American headquarters in Plano.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With their own economy growing quickly, the Chinese arrivals were armed with more money and wanted newer, more expensive homes than Richardson’s usual stock of ranch-style homes built in the 1950s. They found them nearby in towns including Plano and Frisco, part of the supercharged suburban sprawl. Chinese families have clustered in the miles upon miles of new brick houses in subdivisions fortified by brick walls, with names like Whiffletree, Spring Ridge and Hunters Glen North.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Chinese people like newer areas,” said Charlie Yue, who moved from Beijing to the Dallas area in the late 1990s as a student. He bought a new house in Frisco five years ago and now runs a real estate investment firm, snapping up homes that linger on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve traveled to Los Angeles and San Francisco, and I feel like I’ve gone back to China. Texas is wide open, with so much space, which I really love,” said Mr. Yue, who is also vice president of the Association of Chinese Professionals in Richardson. “If you consider how expensive housing is in Beijing or Shanghai, this is a bargain.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">School Pride</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Robinette, an administrator at Missouri State University, often plays tour guide to newly arriving Chinese students. The university, which operates a campus in China, has about 900 Chinese students at its main campus in Springfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long ago, one student’s mother came to him seeking help with a major purchase. He assumed she wanted a recommendation for a car dealer, but she was looking for a real estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When I take them around to the better areas of Springfield, if there’s a For Sale sign they’ll jump out and grab a flier,” said Mr. Robinette, the university’s associate vice president for international programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Education plays an outsize role in Chinese families’ decisions to buy American real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While college enrollment in China is soaring, top schools have limited space. Almost all of the expansion is taking place at poorly regarded universities and polytechnics. Students unable to win admission to prestigious universities frequently apply to American schools if their families can afford it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the university level, the Chinese now make up 31 percent of all international students in the United States, according to the <span class="companylink">Institute of International Education</span>. While New York, Los Angeles and Boston are popular destinations for Chinese students, more are attending universities in the Midwest, with its giant institutions like Ohio State and Michigan State.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their parents often buy homes in college towns. St. Louis real estate listings — homes that average nearly $800,000 — are attracting mainland buyers on the Chinese real estate website Juwai.com[http://Juwai.com]. The influx of Chinese students is most likely the reason, said Simon Henry, the company’s co-chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you look at the student populations of any major or nonmajor university,” Mr. Henry said, “you’ll get a really good indication of what property prices are going to do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The push starts young. About 23,500 Chinese citizens were enrolled in American high schools in 2013, the most recent year for which figures were available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Echo Zha, from Beijing, is renting an apartment in Naperville, Ill., so her 12-year-old daughter can attend school there. She also spent about $200,000 on a small, one-bedroom apartment in Chicago, where she hopes to collect enough rental income to also buy a home in Naperville.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the schools in Beijing, students with high-powered parents or rich parents are given special treatment by the teachers,” Ms. Zha said. “I want my daughter to be in a more fair environment and to grow up with more character and values.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ann Irvine, the principal of Harrington Elementary in Plano, said several Chinese families whose children attended her school had bought two homes simultaneously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One, she explained, was for attending Harrington, which has a bilingual Mandarin-English preschool, and the other to ensure spots later for their children at a high school in a different area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re not talking mansions,” Ms. Irvine said. “We’re talking nice homes with research done thoroughly and the best price point attained.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Eye for Investment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Zhang, the old ranch in Corinth was somewhat of an impulse buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lawyer by training, Mr. Zhang, 42, first came to know Texas during airport layovers while traveling between the coasts for his work, which spans technology, mining, wealth management and other industries. A Chinese friend in Dallas started talking about a patch of undeveloped land in Corinth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, Mr. Zhang paid $6.8 million in cash for Canyon Lake Ranch, his first foray into American real estate. He renamed the lake after himself; it’s now officially Long Lake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I chose Dallas because the unique culture of the city was evident on my first visit and has since impressed me with every return visit,” Mr. Zhang said in a statement. “Compared to other U.S. metropolitan areas, Dallas presents numerous prospects for all walks of life, drawing people from across the country and globally.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vivian Tsou, chief operating officer and president of Lelege USA, Mr. Zhang’s development company, put it bluntly: “The bang for your buck is higher here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseas real estate speculation by Chinese investors started to rise after the recession in America began to recede in 2009. The two markets have been out of sync, creating opportunities. American home prices have been in a recovery phase, while the Chinese boom has been fading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions of Chinese are looking to park their money in countries where there is less risk of arbitrary confiscation and more political stability. Some want to obscure the true extent of their wealth, while others are trying to diversify their assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China’s history of corruption has also left people vulnerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to state media, a top government official, Bo Xilai, and his aides ordered the confiscation of as much as $15 billion from wealthy families, who were accused of crimes based on sometimes flimsy evidence. Mr. Bo, a former member of the Politburo, is now serving a life sentence[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/world/asia/bo-xilai-official-is-found-guilty-of-all-charges-and-given-life-term.html] for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> analysis found that some types of capital outflows closely follow Chinese anti-corruption campaigns. As crackdowns intensify in China, outflows tend to increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investments in the United States provide another advantage: a pathway to a green card.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese investors have been particularly aggressive at using a federal visa program called EB-5 that allows overseas citizens to put $500,000 to $1 million into a project that will create at least 10 jobs. Investors can get a green card in about two years. So far this year, 86 percent of the EB-5 visas issued worldwide have gone to Chinese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the homes in the development at Long Lake are also being marketed locally, mainland buyers are eligible for this program. “These high-caliber homes will bring high-caliber residents,” said Ms. Tsou of Lelege.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ida Hung, a real estate agent and feng shui specialist in the Dallas office of the Virginia Cook agency, which now has the exclusive listing for the Long Lake development, peddles the homes to contacts in the area’s Chinese community and beyond. On a recent afternoon, she stopped at Tam’s, a Chinese buffet in Richardson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last decade or so, the restaurant’s owner, Wing Tam, has bought seven condos and houses that ranged in price from $20,000 to $500,000 — one for his sister, one for an employee in his kitchen, one for his wife, one because it was a good price, one for investment purposes and so on. He paid cash for them all, except for his own Dallas home, which he bought in 2008 with a mortgage he has since paid off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a busy lunch hour, he pored over the materials for the Corinth development but decided the location was a bit too remote. He offered to put Ms. Hung in touch with Chinese friends who live in Arkansas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They are very rich. They don’t know how to spend their money,” said Mr. Tam, tucking one of the brochures under his arm. “They need to invest.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Housing starts in the United States fell to a seven-month low in October, weighed down by a steep decline in the construction of multifamily homes. A surge in building permits, though, suggested that the housing market remained on solid ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreaking dropped 11 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.06 million units last month, the lowest level since March, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October was the seventh consecutive month that starts remained above one million units, the longest stretch since 2007. Building permits increased 4.1 percent to an annual rate of 1.15 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rapidly rising household formation, driven mostly by young adults' leaving their parental homes along with a strengthening labor market, is supporting the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over all, fundamentals for the sector remain solid. Household formation is rising, demand for new homes is outstripping supply, and homebuilder confidence remains near its highest level in a decade,'' said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS in Stamford, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlighting the housing market's underlying strength, a second report from the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> showed applications for loans to purchase homes jumped 6.2 percent during the week that ended Nov. 13 from a week earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the soft October housing numbers, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> trimmed its fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point, to a 2.2 percent annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has contributed to G.D.P. growth in each of the last six quarters, adding 0.2 percentage point to the third-quarter's 1.5 percent growth pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast that housing starts would drop to only a 1.16-million-unit pace last month. Many viewed the weakness in October as being related to land and labor shortages, constraints that have been flagged by homebuilders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Structural issues including a shortfall in immigrant labor are inhibiting construction. The supply shortage in the single-family market is not likely to be alleviated anytime soon,'' said David Nice, an economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreaking on single-family home projects, the largest segment of the housing market, fell 2.4 percent to a 722,000-unit pace in October. Single-family starts were pulled down by a 6.9 percent plunge in groundbreaking activity in the South, where most homebuilding takes place. Single-family starts rose in the Northeast, the Midwest and the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts for the volatile multifamily segment plunged 25.1 percent to a 338,000-unit pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family building permits rose 2.4 percent last month to their highest level since December 2007. Single-family permits in the South also hit their highest level since December 2007. Multifamily building permits increased 6.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The October permit requests were above the starts number, and for the past three months permits have been running a little ahead of the building pace, so don't be surprised if housing activity rebounds solidly in November,'' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frederick Jones and Ping Wong are both over 85; both live on fixed incomes; and both have health problems that limit their mobility. From there, their lives diverge in ways that illuminate the uneven challenges facing New York's oldest old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jones, 88, did everything he could to secure a comfortable retirement. He worked for nearly 35 years for the City of New York, retiring with substantial savings and a union pension and Social Security benefits adding up to $3,000 a month. Ms. Wong, 90, never had the opportunity to save for her old age. She worked part time for below the minimum wage at a doctor's office in Chinatown, earning $500 to $700 a month. Her retirement income, including food stamps, comes to about a third of Mr. Jones's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the differences in their lives are not what one might expect. Because her income is so low, Ms. Wong qualified for a subsidized apartment in an elevator building near Gramercy Park, where she pays roughly $200 a month in rent and spends her days playing mah-jongg with friends in the downstairs activity room. A home attendant comes for seven hours a day, cleaning and cooking and running errands, at no charge to Ms. Wong. Until recently, when Ms. Wong decided she did not like the food, she received food seven days a week from CityMeals-on-Wheels, which asks only for a voluntary donation. She never worries about money, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very cheap for low-income people,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jones, in contrast, falls into what has been called a doughnut hole: He earns too much money to be eligible for most government subsidies, but not enough to pay for the services that would make his old age comfortable. Though he pays only $300 a month for a rent-controlled apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, the building has no elevator and the low rent has become a trap. Mr. Jones had parts of two toes amputated this summer, making the 36 stairs to his third-floor apartment a grueling test. Cleaning and cooking are almost beyond him; on my last visit, I changed two light bulbs for him because he could not get up on a ladder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jones could afford to pay somewhat more in rent. But rents in his neighborhood have risen sharply, to an average of $1,991 for a one-bedroom apartment, according to the Brooklyn real estate brokerage MNS. Walk-ups in the building next door were recently advertised for $1,500 a month. And hiring a home attendant for even a couple of hours a day would eat up a third of his income. For now, he said recently, after a long and slow ascent up the stairs, he is stuck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every time they come out with a new benefit for the elderly, it's for people who make less than me, so that's the end of it,'' Mr. Jones said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They built a new building for the elderly about two blocks from where my daughter lives, so that was great. She said, please take that apartment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Jones said the building was only for people with incomes below $15,000 a year. ''And thank God I got a little more than that,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jones and Ms. Wong are among the six New Yorkers over age 85 whom I have been following since the beginning of the year. They represent one of the fastest-growing age groups in New York, nearly doubling in number since 1980 -- healthier, better educated and more independent than any like cohort before them. Many never planned to live this long, or to navigate a financial landscape as confounding as the one they are in now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their lifetimes they have seen Social Security and Medicare greatly reduce poverty among older people. But in New York today, they face a challenge of prosperity. The boom in housing prices has left many of them vulnerable, often clinging to apartments that are no longer suitable for their aging bodies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People end up as prisoners in their own home,'' said Donna M. Corrado, commissioner of the city's Department for the Aging. Even the real estate winners -- those who bought cheaply, before the market took off -- now face rising property taxes that may overwhelm their fixed incomes. And older tenants with low rents are prime targets for unscrupulous landlords, who want them to move out so they can raise the apartments to market rates. ''It's a vicious cycle, and greater in New York than anywhere else,'' Ms. Corrado said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One result has been to drive relatively healthy people into nursing homes, where Medicaid picks up the tab for eligible seniors, said Daniel Reingold, president and chief executive of the nonprofit RiverSpring Health, which operates the Hebrew Home at Riverdale in the Bronx.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have people in our facility, you say, why are they here?'' Mr. Reingold said. ''They seem to be in good shape. They lived in a three-story walk-up, or they outlived their money. They're coming to a nursing home because they can't afford their housing or there is no available housing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some don't have this option. Typically, about 2,000 people age 60 and up stay over in the city's homeless shelters, according to the nonprofit group LiveOn NY, which works on behalf of senior centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Bill de Blasio has promised to build or preserve 10,000 units of affordable housing for the elderly and 1,000 units for homeless seniors. Mr. de Blasio also expanded a rent freeze for eligible people age 62 and over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a lot of catching up to do. Of the 165,000 units of affordable housing created or preserved in the last decade of the Bloomberg administration, only about 3,600 were earmarked for low-income older people, mostly under a federal program that was vastly curtailed in 2010, according to LiveOn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Ms. Wong's building near Gramercy Park, where rents are set at 30 percent of a tenant's income, the waiting list for apartments has been closed almost since the building opened 10 years ago, because so many people applied for the 70 apartments, said Philip Deans, the housing manager for Cabrini Apartments, a part of the nonprofit Cabrini Elder Care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm still working from that original list,'' Mr. Deans said. ''Every week I receive walk-ins or phone calls from children in crisis mode: 'What can I do? Where can I go?'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A comparable subsidized building that opened in Queens three years ago received more than 2,700 applications for 66 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent afternoon, Mr. Jones sat on a couch piled with incomprehensible bills and statements that had accrued during his two-month convalescence in a rehabilitation center after foot surgery. Most of the medical bills are covered by Medicare or his supplemental insurance, but a few of them -- $50 for an ambulance he didn't want, late fees for utility or credit card bills he wasn't home to receive -- require him to pay. Such bills can add up: After age 85, the average Medicare beneficiary has nearly $8,200 a year in out-of-pocket medical expenses and premiums, according to the <span class="companylink">Kaiser Family Foundation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jones was not dismayed. He never is. ''Oh no, I don't have any money worries, thank God,'' he said. ''I have none. My only money worries are, keep the ladies away from it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He opened a folder of photos from his younger days: sporting a double-breasted suit and flared pocket handkerchief, or in a boxer's stance, with a bushy mustache curling rakishly down around his upper lip. They are portraits of a player in full plumage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I asked him when in his life he was happiest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now,'' he said without hesitation. ''I have health problems, but it's been going on a long time, so it's secondary. But I think happiness really is what's going on at a particular time. I used to think happiness was something that somebody brought to you. But happiness, as opposed to enjoyment, is when you are doing something and you are elated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jones was born in 1927, two years before the start of the Great Depression, and lost his father, to a burst appendix, before his third birthday. His mother supported the family in Norfolk, Va., as a seamstress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My mother took care of my grandmother, my brother, myself and herself, and she was making $25 a week,'' Mr. Jones said. ''I say, man, money is worth nothing these days.'' He said he never knew he was poor until he was 16 or 17, when he read about how other people lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After serving overseas during World War II, he attended <span class="companylink">Virginia State University</span> for free on the G.I. Bill, and when he got to New York, an older man steered him toward the civil service. ''He said, 'If you don't want to ever be on the unemployment line, work for the city, state or federal government, don't steal anything, and you got it made.' And that was true.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On his couch, Mr. Jones smiled at the memories. An old bicycle, unused since 1967, stood between the couch and a metal window gate. A working television rested atop a nonworking one that Mr. Jones would like to sell. He does not have cable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment's intercom has not worked for close to a year, so if any visitors come, Mr. Jones has to either walk downstairs or hope they'll wait until someone opens the front door. Last year he successfully sued his landlord to get handrails on the staircase. Mr. Jones said the landlord had no incentive to make him comfortable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He often skips meals because it is too much trouble to shop and cook, he said. If there are services available to him, he is not aware of them, and as more public information migrates to the Internet, it might as well be on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in many ways he is fortunate to have the apartment. Seniors in New York pay the highest share of their income on rent: nearly 58 percent for single elderly renters, compared with 34 percent for average households, according to a 2011 survey by the Department of Housing and Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the building has its advantages, Mr. Jones said. Neighbors check in on him or help carry things up the stairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I retired, my purpose was to make friends, get all the retirement money that I could and move from where I am now,'' he said. ''But I never did it. When you get hung up between cheap rent in a bad place and expensive rent in a better place, you say, this is not that good, but I've been here for certain years, and I keep talking myself into staying here. When people say they're paying a thousand dollars a month rent, I don't raise an eyebrow, 'cause that's what's going on now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the activity room at Cabrini Apartments, Ping Wong expounded on her good fortune, with one complaint. Ms. Wong walks stiffly after replacement surgery on both hips and has arthritis pain in her arms and legs. One of her neighbors, who is two years younger than she is, receives more hours from her home attendant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I need more hours, not just seven hours,'' Ms. Wong said. ''I'm older than her, so I should have more time. My home attendant comes at 11 o'clock and leaves at 6. I have too many things to do myself in the morning.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Deans, the housing manager, said Ms. Wong was ''about average'' at taking advantage of available public services. ''She's aware of it but doesn't know how to tap into it,'' he said. But she is very sociable and seeks out the building's social workers, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immigrants like Ms. Wong now make up nearly half of New York's senior population, and 40 percent of those age 85 and over -- even as the population of native-born seniors has declined over the last decade, according to the Center for an Urban Future, a research group. These immigrants face particular financial challenges as they age, especially those who arrived too late to earn substantial pension or Social Security benefits. Chinese-born immigrants over age 65 are among the poorest, with a median income of $7,000, compared with $18,300 for their native-born peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wong grew up in Hong Kong, one of five sisters born to a successful home builder. When she finished high school, she said, her father wanted help working with English-speaking clients, so he sent her to London for a year to learn the language.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when she immigrated to the United States in 1982, her limited English skills kept her in low-wage jobs, and her husband died before earning more than minimal Social Security survivor benefits. She worked until she was nearly 80, commuting from Staten Island to Chinatown in Manhattan, until she began to fear she would be knocked down in the crowded city buses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Ms. Wong economizes by not buying clothing, and stretches her $200 monthly food stamps by sending her home attendant to Chinatown to shop. She gets cheap prescription drug coverage through <span class="companylink">AARP</span>, and uses a cellphone provided by her daughter. With her meager savings, she managed to buy a $20,000 burial insurance policy, so she would not burden her daughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago her daughter gave her a laptop so she could communicate with her grandchildren in China, but the machine was too heavy for Ms. Wong to move around the apartment, and when they tried a tablet, Ms. Wong's hands shook too much to work the touchscreen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wong thinks often about money, and what she thinks is: People should spend it while they're young -- travel the world, enjoy life. ''What's the use keeping money in the bank?'' she said. ''Not to keep it for descendants. They have their own salary. I need not take care of them. They should take care of me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added: ''I'm not the elderly person keeping the money in the quilt or the refrigerator. I like to spend.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her daughter, Elaine Gin, who lives in New Jersey, handles her Social Security checks and bills, and allots her $200 each month in spending money, as well as occasional sums from her own accounts. ''I couldn't go to the bank to withdraw money,'' Ms. Wong said. ''She tells me how much I spend, how much is left. If I need money to give to people here, she gives it to me.'' Ms. Wong thinks a bigger tip to her home attendant's agency this Christmas will get her approved for more hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toward the other end of the economic spectrum are New Yorkers like Ruth Willig, 92, who pays more than $5,000 a month to live in an assisted living center in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Ms. Willig, who worked as a microbiologist, never handled her investments until her husband died 20 years ago, leaving her with a broker whose conversation she says she does not always understand. ''But he's done well for me,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Ms. Willig, too, has been buffeted by the economy. Last year she had to leave her assisted living home in Park Slope, Brooklyn, when the owner abruptly announced plans to close it. (A few residents are still living there, under degraded conditions.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reared in Brownsville during the Depression, Ms. Willig was always cautious with money. She and her husband took the family on vacations, but in tent trailers rather than hotels. They sent their four children to college, but to state schools. ''There were times when to write the check we had to wait for the next income,'' she said. ''But I really don't think I was worrying that much about it. He tried to keep me informed, but I really didn't pay that much attention.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When her friends from the Park Slope center moved to a comparable building in Lower Manhattan, she chose Sheepshead Bay instead, in part because it was less expensive. She misses her friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent morning in her tidy one-bedroom apartment, Ms. Willig talked about something she called ''my dilemma.'' She wore a neat T-shirt that she had put off ironing because it hurts her to bend to plug in the iron, the sort of small task that is getting harder every year. Her dilemma was whether to endure the pain or hire an attendant, which can grow increasingly expensive. She did not want to outlive her savings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices are raising equity levels, and homeowners are cashing in on these gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first three quarters of this year, the sales volume of single-family homes and condominiums reached the highest level since the same period in 2006, according to RealtyTrac, a provider of property data. Homeowners who sold during the third quarter also reaped the highest price gain in eight years -- an average of 17 percent over their purchase price, or $40,658.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data shows that homeowners are taking advantage of rising values by refinancing their mortgages in order to cash out a portion of their equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group of homeowners that RealtyTrac categorizes as ''equity rich,'' meaning they have at least 50 percent equity in their homes, has been increasing over all, said Daren Blomquist, a vice president of RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the third quarter, the share declined from the quarter before, to 19.2 percent of all homeowners with a mortgage from 19.6 percent. The group with less than 50 percent equity, however, grew, while the ranks of those with negative equity shrank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What that tells me,'' Mr. Blomquist said, ''is that people are either selling and moving into a bigger home, or refinancing it and leveraging some of that equity, so they don't have as much equity in the home as they did before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refinancing activity in general has risen in recent months, as interest rates have remained low. In September, refinanced loans represented 42 percent of lenders' loan volume, according to Ellie Mae, a software provider for the mortgage industry. That was a 5 percent increase over August, and the highest level since May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many mid- to high-end housing markets, rising home prices have made it difficult for existing homeowners to move up, said Norman T. Koenigsberg, the president and chief executive of First Choice Loan Services in East Brunswick, N.J. As an alternative, he said, ''families are tapping into their equity to improve their homes, either as a long-term strategy or to enable them to resell it sooner at a greater profit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lending guidelines typically do not allow borrowers to cash out more than 80 percent of their home's value, although there are some government-sponsored programs that will allow so-called cash-outs of up to 85 percent, Mr. Koenigsberg said. The interest rate on a cash-out refinance loan is usually an eighth to a quarter of a percentage point higher than on a straight refinance, depending on the borrower's credit score and the loan to value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates are expected to creep up in coming months, which can make refinancing less advantageous. Homeowners who need access to their equity may be less rate-sensitive than borrowers looking to refinance to cut their monthly payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even so, borrowers planning to cash out should consider that ''chances are better than two out of three that the time to do this is now, as opposed to January or February of next year,'' said Michael L. Moskowitz, the president of Equity Now, a direct lender in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it's a good deal now, don't wait for a better deal tomorrow,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners in the boroughs around Manhattan, and especially Brooklyn, are taking advantage of the soaring prices there with cash-out refis, said Matt Hackett, the underwriting and operations manager for Equity Now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But unlike the cash-out craze that accompanied the housing bubble, he said, ''the reasons for cash-out now tend to be much more utilitarian or investment motivated, not for consumption or luxury.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDThe upward trajectory of rents in many metropolitan areas, which shows no sign of abating, often makes homeownership the better deal. But renters still aren't rushing to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate listing and lender websites are awash in charts and mortgage calculators aimed at persuading renters that they can cut their monthly costs by buying a home. The problem is, ''increasing rents have a very paradoxical effect on the housing market,'' said Ralph McLaughlin, a housing economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, the real estate information site. ''Rising rents make it a relatively better deal to buy, but it also makes it more difficult for households to save up for a down payment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent report from <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found that the rent-versus-buy differential is the widest it's been since 2012, when mortgage interest rates bottomed out. Nationally, buying is 23 percent cheaper than renting. It is also cheaper to buy than to rent, in varying degrees, in all but two of the country's 100 largest metropolitan areas. (Honolulu and San Jose, Calif., are the exceptions.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In calculating the cost differences, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> assumed home buyers put down 10 percent of the purchase price, got a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 3.85 percent, and would stay in the home for five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The areas where buying is the better deal by far -- upward of 40 percent cheaper -- include Houston; Baton Rouge, La., and New Orleans; Syracuse, N.Y., and Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap is smaller in hot markets in California, like San Francisco and Sacramento, as well as in the New York metropolitan area, where it is 11 percent cheaper to buy, the report says. However, most New York City lenders require at least 20 percent down, which lowers the monthly payments but calls for more cash up front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a third-quarter market report from Zillow, the real estate listing site, annual growth in rents has outpaced or kept up with annual growth in home values nationally for most of this year. And metropolitan areas where home values are rising the fastest also tend to be those where rents are skyrocketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the homeownership rate remains low. According to the <span class="companylink">United States Census Bureau</span>, it was 63.7 percent as of the third quarter, 0.7 percentage points lower than a year ago. The rate has been on a steady decline since the mid-2000s, when it topped 69 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a September survey of 1,000 renters conducted for TD Bank, more than half said their rent had increased within the last two years. The average monthly increase was $288.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty percent of those surveyed reported that they were likely to buy a home within the next two years, citing rising rents and a desire to build equity. But an equal share said they either hadn't saved enough money or had too much debt to buy now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's really about wage increases,'' said Ray Rodriguez, the regional mortgage sales manager in the New York area for TD Bank. ''They can't keep up with the increases in rents and home prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Rodriguez said that renters' hopes to buy were realistic given the improving economy and the availability of mortgage programs requiring very low down payments. TD Bank's first-time buyer program for low- to moderate-income households, for example, requires only 3 percent down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McLaughlin of <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> said he does not expect the homeownership rate to rise much, however, until the so-called millennial generation -- often defined as between ages 18 and 34 -- starts forming its own households, marrying and having children in greater numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those are three things that millennials are taking their sweet time to do,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDAt the Hog Island Oyster Company in Marshall, Calif., diners eat at picnic tables overlooking Tomales Bay, where oysters and clams grow just offshore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while lunch reaches your plate with virtually no food-miles on it, that is not true of Hog Island's staff. ''We have 57 employees here at the farm,'' said Terry Sawyer, the operation's co-founder. ''Maybe a dozen of them live out here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Out here'' is the westernmost reaches of West Marin, in Marin County about 40 miles north of San Francisco. Federal parkland, Point Reyes National Seashore, constitutes much of the region. A further 47,000 acres of agricultural land is protected in perpetuity through conservation easements purchased by <span class="companylink">Marin Agricultural Land Trust</span> , a local nonprofit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surrounded by stunning coastal landscapes and organic farms, rural outposts like Marshall and Point Reyes Station have become such popular recreation spots that many local working people can no longer afford to live here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flush urbanites snap up 900-square-foot cabins with appliances dating from the Carter administration for $800,000. Places that once served as long-term rentals now compete for tourist dollars on Airbnb.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is such a spectrum of need here, a lack of options at all different income levels,'' said Kim Thompson, executive director of Community Land Trust Association of West Marin, a nonprofit in Point Reyes Station called CLAM for short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As rising housing costs increase economic segregation throughout Marin County and the Bay Area, communities are turning to land trusts, local nonprofits that acquire properties to create permanently affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2000, there were around 90 community land trusts in the United States. Now, there are around 250, according to the National Community Land Trust Network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents created West Marin's community land trust in 2001. ''Because of the immense cost of housing here, a lot of people were very skeptical of us in the beginning,'' says Christa Burgoyne, a longtime volunteer and donor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group aspired to produce affordable housing in a highly sustainable, almost artisanal fashion. ''Instead of consolidating permanently affordable housing in one development,'' said a trust board member, Marshall Livingston, ''we wanted to sprinkle it throughout the community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the land trust model gives local residents significant control over the way affordable housing is integrated into their villages, it also obligates them to provide direct financial support and other hands-on involvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Historically, CLAM has been able to purchase properties before they go on the market because of the relationships in our community,'' Ms. Thompson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when a seller is disposed to support the land trust, it still helps to have enough money to close a deal quickly. In 2014, a supporter made a zero-interest $300,000 bridge loan so the trust could buy a property outright. Then, it raised an additional $140,000, mostly from individuals, for renovations. Fourteen years into its existence, the organization provides permanently affordable housing for nine households. In most cases, it retains ownership of the property and rents to tenants at below-market rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its most recent project, it sold the home to the family that occupies it while maintaining ownership of the land beneath. This shared-equity approach helps ensure affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the standard approach to affordable homeownership, the subsidy that makes the home affordable often takes the form of a zero-interest loan that does not have to be repaid unless the homeowner sells the property. At that point, the entity that provided the subsidy recaptures it and reinvests it, subsidizing another home buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rising prices in a desirable real estate market can be a problem. ''When this continues over two generations, it gets too expensive to keep resubsidizing the house,'' said Dev Goetschius, executive director of the Housing Land Trust of Sonoma County in California. ''So that unit goes out of the affordable housing stock. It gets lost to the open market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the community land trust model, permanent affordability is achieved in part by taking the land out of the equation. The buyer purchases only the house, so the price is lower. Owners who participate in these programs also agree to sell at a price pegged to average median income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On every one of our resales, people have left with more money than they bought their house for,'' Ms. Goetschius said. ''It wasn't a windfall, but we were able to get the next families in without any additional subsidies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's why a land trust is a good place for a philanthropist,'' said Susan Scott, a CLAM board member. ''If you want to make an investment in property that is really going to be permanently affordable, it needs to be owned by the community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the trust has its sights set on a 30-acre site on the outskirts of Point Reyes Station. For 42 years, it served as residential housing for the Coast Guard, but its 10 boxy townhomes and a 21-room dormitory now stand empty and unused. While legislation requires the Coast Guard to sell the complex at fair market value, the trust is leading efforts to obtain it and convert it into affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making this deal work will most likely require support from Marin County and other outside sources. But it will also demand a new level of commitment from local residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a region that has spent much of the last 50 years promoting ecosystem diversity, though, a lot is at stake. For many residents, a monocrop of million-dollar homes is nearly as awful a nightmare as suburban sprawl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know in our bones that we need more affordable housing,'' says Mark Switzer, a trust fund-raising committee member. ''It's an issue of community health.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks ended closely mixed Monday as investors began another big week of company earnings and looked ahead to a policy meeting of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About one-third through the quarterly earnings season, results have been ''nothing spectacular,'' said Kristina Hooper, investment strategist at <span class="companylink">Allianz Global Investors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More troubling than the middling income reports, she said, is the fact that many companies are failing to meet analysts' forecasts for revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we really should be focusing on is the revenue picture, and that's more negative,'' Ms. Hooper said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will meet Tuesday and Wednesday, and while the central bank has said it wants to raise interest rates soon, few investors expect that to happen this year because the global economy remains weak. The Fed left interest rates untouched in September, which helped set off a rally that pulled stocks out of the red for 2015 last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index dipped 3.97 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,071.18. The S.&amp;P. 500 remains positive for the year. The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average, which is still negative for the year, fell 23.65 points, or 0.1 percent, to 17,623.05. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> rose 2.84 points, less than 0.1 percent, to 5,034.70.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the earnings news was bad. Shares in LendingTree, the online mortgage broker, soared $22.98, or 23.5 percent, to $120.98 after the company reported better-than-expected results for the third quarter. LendingTree also raised its revenue estimate for the year and gave an optimistic forecast for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock in the <span class="companylink">Laboratory Corporation of America</span>, a medical lab operator, rose $5.79, or 5.2 percent, to $117.74 after its third-quarter results also topped estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Xerox</span> shares fell 31 cents, or 3 percent, to $10.03 after the business services and copier company reported disappointing quarterly revenue. The company said it would conduct a review of its operations in hopes of raising value for its shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies continued to combine. The <span class="companylink">IntercontinentalExchange</span>, the owner of the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span> and other markets and known as ICE, said it would buy the privately held market data company Interactive Data for $5.2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Duke Energy</span>, the biggest electric company in the United States, said it would buy <span class="companylink">Piedmont Natural Gas</span> for about $4.9 billion. Piedmont shares surged $15.60, or 37 percent, to $57.82.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist for BlackRock, said he expected the current wave of company deals to continue as global economic growth remained gradual and borrowing costs remained low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market lift from those deals, however, might not last long, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deals have given the market ''a bit of a sugar high,'' Mr. Koesterich said, driving stocks higher despite disappointing company results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In economic news, the government reported an unexpected drop in new home sales. Sales fell to their slowest pace in 10 months in September, hit by higher home prices and softer economic growth. The report helped send homebuilder shares lower. <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> fell 14 cents, or 1 percent, to $13.83.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States crude oil lost 62 cents, or 1.4 percent, to settle at $43.98 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, fell 45 cents, or nearly 1 percent, to $47.54 a barrel in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of gold rose $3.70 to $1,167 an ounce. The prices of United States government bonds rose. The yield on the 10-year <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> note fell to 2.06 percent from 2.09 percent late Friday.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes in the United States fell to near a one-year low in September after two straight months of gains, but a jump in prices suggested that housing remained on solid ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Monday that sales dropped 11.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 468,000 units, the lowest level since November 2014. August's sales pace was revised down to 529,000 units from the previously reported 552,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moderation in new-home sales is at odds with other housing reports that have painted a bullish picture of the sector. New-home sales, which account for 7.8 percent of the housing market, tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis because they are drawn from a small sample.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The September report does little to alter our view that the housing market is continuing to recover,'' said David Silver, an economist at J.P. Morgan. ''We view the new-home sales data as unreliable and many other more reliable housing indicators have been sending upbeat signals lately.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September data on existing-home sales, home builder confidence and housing starts have been fairly strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home rose 13.5 percent from a year ago to a nine-month high of $296,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The strong price gains suggest either that the mix of houses shifted to more expensive houses or that home builders are pushing up prices,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ''Weakening demand would be accompanied by slowing price gains or price declines.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sturdy housing market is supporting consumer spending through an increase in household wealth, which is helping to soften the blow on the economy from faltering global growth, a strong dollar and weak capital spending in the energy sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efforts by businesses to reduce excess inventory have also weighed on growth, leaving gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter running below a 2.0 percent annualized rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy grew at a 3.9 percent rate in the second quarter. The government will publish its advance third-quarter G.D.P. estimate on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast new-home sales slipping, but only to a rate of 550,000 units. Sales were up 2.0 percent compared with September of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales tumbled 61.8 percent in the Northeast to the lowest level since April. Sales declined 6.7 percent in the West and were down 8.7 percent in the populous South. In the Midwest, sales fell 8.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With sales weak, the stock of new houses for sale increased 4.2 percent to 225,000 last month, the highest level since March 2010. Still, supply remains less than half of what it was at the height of the housing boom. At September's sales pace it would take 5.8 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, the highest since July 2014. That was up from 4.9 months in August.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I own and live in a Brooklyn townhouse. Someone has been locking his or her bike to my wrought-iron fence in front of my house. I have left a note asking that it be moved, but the person keeps leaving it there. What are my options?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fort Greene, Brooklyn</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding a place to park a bike in New York City is no easy feat. Lock it to a tree and you can get slapped with a $1,000 fine. Chain your bike to a subway entrance railing and the Metropolitan Transit Authority will haul it off to the Lost Property Unit. Parking meters and street signs are risky and potentially illegal. Given the dearth of options, your wrought-iron fence probably looks like a decent one, especially since rules about parking a bike on private property are vague.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Locking a bicycle to someone else's fence without permission is obnoxious,'' said Thomas P. Higgins, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. ''But from a legal perspective, there is not a lot of recourse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bike rider is trespassing on your property, but the police will not intervene about a civil matter. You could file a civil suit against the bike owner, but that would not get you very far, since your damages would be minimal. Resist the urge to cut the lock and remove the bike, because doing so is illegal. If you cut the lock and leave the bike where it is, you would be liable for the value of the bike if it were to be stolen. Regardless, cutting someone's lock is not a particularly neighborly thing to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what can you do? You could post a sign telling cyclists to park elsewhere. You could confront the rider, requesting that he or she find another place to park. Or you could file a request with the Department of Transportation to add bike racks to your neighborhood. But the waiting list for racks is long. Ask your community board to make a request too, as it might have more sway than one lonely voice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should They Stay or Go?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My wife and I entered into a contract to buy a townhouse with a contingency: If the seller could not find a suitable house to purchase, she could cancel the deal. We then put our house on the market, and received an offer above asking price. Alas, the seller of the townhouse did not find a new residence and canceled the contract. (She insists that she eventually wants to sell to us, but our lawyer worries that she could drag this out indefinitely.) So we are faced with a decision: Should we accept the offer on our house without a home lined up to buy? Or should we take our house off the market and relist it in the spring? Waiting feels like a gamble: Interest rates could rise, and we might not get as good an offer again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Orange, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying or selling your home is often a gamble, and you frequently have scant control over the cards you are dealt. So before you make your next move, answer this basic question: Why, exactly, do you want to sell?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want to sell because you want to live in a townhouse like the one you recently found, know that another one might not be available in the immediate future (and the original seller may not relist her home). ''The real question you have to ask yourself is: 'How much do I really want this townhouse?' '' said Vanessa Pollock, a Maplewood, N.J., sales agent for Keller Williams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you are tempted to sell because you have received an offer too good to refuse, then now is the time to act. You might not receive a comparable offer the next time you list your house. ''We know what the market is now,'' said Allison Maguire, a Halstead Property sales agent in Montclair, N.J. ''The spring market is an unknown.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decide how flexible you are about the future. If you are willing to buy something other than a townhouse or could live in a rental for a few months, take the offer. After all, that townhouse is not the only home for sale in New Jersey -- and you would not be the first person to sell your home without another one lined up. ''The fall market is a strong one, with inventory being replenished daily,'' Ms. Maguire said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if your heart is set on the townhouse or one like it, hold out for what you really want. If you play your cards right, you might even fetch a higher price next spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tossing a Former Tenant's Stuff</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My tenant of 18 months moved out abruptly, leaving some personal items like dishware, a cooler, exercise weights and shoes. None of the items appear essential or valuable, but I imagine she would still want them. I have texted her and left voice messages, but she won't return my calls. How long am I legally obligated to hold onto her abandoned personal items? May I discard them after a reasonable period of time, or do I have to store them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants frequently leave behind belongings when they move out, sometimes intentionally and other times by accident. But before you toss those dishes and shoes, make sure that you are allowed to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One person's garbage is another person's treasure,'' said Bradley Scott Silverbush, a Manhattan lawyer who represents landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Read the lease carefully. Most leases say that once a tenant surrenders an apartment, any belongings that remain are considered abandoned, and the landlord can dispose of them -- and charge the tenant for removal costs. If your tenant has properly relinquished the apartment, send her an email or a letter by certified mail laying out your intentions. (Those voice mail messages do not suffice, because they leave no paper trail.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But you mentioned that she left abruptly. Did she give back the keys and declare in writing that she was surrendering possession of the apartment? If not, she might still have a claim to it, even if she is not returning your phone calls or living there. As a landlord, you cannot unilaterally decide that a tenant has abandoned an apartment. Instead, you have to sue the tenant to recover possession of the apartment so you can clean it out. Otherwise, you could be liable for improperly disposing of a tenant's belongings, Mr. Silverbush said. So until you are absolutely certain that your tenant has surrendered the apartment, you probably do not have the right to toss her stuff.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home resales rebounded strongly in September and new applications for unemployment benefits hovered around 42-year lows last week, suggesting solid domestic fundamentals even as the global economy falters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's upbeat housing and labor market reports could keep the door open to an interest-rate increase from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you are seeing in the data is that the domestic picture looks strong, and I think that's what the Fed is going to be looking at closely,'' said Thomas Costerg, a United States economist at <span class="companylink">Standard Chartered Bank</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said home resales increased 4.7 percent last month, to an annual rate of 5.55 million units, almost erasing August's decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A firming housing market is lifting household wealth, which is driving a robust pace of consumer spending. In turn, strong domestic demand has cushioned the blow to the economy from softening global growth, a strong dollar and weak capital spending in the energy industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth has also been squeezed by businesses' efforts to reduce an inventory bulge, leaving growth estimates for the gross domestic product in the third quarter running below a 1.5 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.9 percent rate in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing remains constrained by a dearth of properties available for sale. But rising house prices could encourage homeowners to put their properties on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a previously owned home rose 6.1 percent from September 2014. Realtors and economists say insufficient equity has contributed to the tight housing inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unsold inventory of houses on the market fell 2.6 percent in September from August. At September's sales pace, it would take 4.8 months to clear houses from the market, down from 5.1 months in August. A six-month stock is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing index fell 0.43 percent, underperforming a generally stronger stock market. Shares in <span class="companylink">D. R. Horton</span>, the largest United States home builder, declined 1.21 percent. <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> slipped 0.48 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar rallied against the euro on the data and dovish comments from the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>. Prices for longer-dated United States government bonds fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state jobless benefits rose 3,000, to a seasonally adjusted 259,000, for the week that ended Oct. 17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, they remained not too far from levels last seen in late 1973, and it was the 33rd consecutive week that claims were below the 300,000 threshold, which is normally associated with a firming job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At current levels, there is not much room for claims to fall further. Additionally, the very low level of layoffs suggests that the labor market remains in good shape, despite a recent abrupt slowdown in job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These data signal that companies remain extremely unwilling to let go of labor and that the number of short-term unemployed remains very low,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of claims, which is considered a better measure of labor market trends because it strips out week-to-week volatility, slipped 2,000 last week to 263,250, the lowest level since December 1973.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The claims report covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for the payrolls portion of October's unemployment report. The four-week moving average of claims fell 9,250 between the September and October survey periods. That suggested a pickup in job gains this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of continuing claims was the lowest since late 2000, suggesting a further decline in the unemployment rate from 5.1 percent in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With August and September being notorious for initially underreporting job gains, today's data add to the case that employment growth will pick up in October and the unemployment rate will continue to grind lower,'' Mr. Ryding said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors, shaken by the sell-off in the broader market, are frantically seeking refuge in companies offering buybacks, high dividend yields -- anything that can stop the bleeding in their portfolios. And certain real estate investment trusts are quickly becoming an attractive option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report released recently by <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> shows a surge in the number of REITs planning stock buybacks through the rest of 2015 and into 2016 to prop up their beaten-down prices. During second-quarter earnings conference calls, at least 28 REITs discussed plans to repurchase shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The companies are signaling there's a big disconnect between the current valuation in the public market and where private market real estate values are,'' said Thomas Bohjalian, an executive vice president at Cohen &amp; Steers, which holds shares in REITs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real estate fundamentals -- such as demand, occupancy and rents -- remain strong, which has kept property values up in the private market, said Steven Marks, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> who specializes in United States REITs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The private market is valuing real estate assets more highly than Wall Street is -- which is why companies are buying back their own stock,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs currently trade at a 15 to 20 percent discount on average to the value of their underlying properties, according to Michael Knott, a managing director at Green Street Advisors, a REIT research and advisory firm in Newport Beach, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's one of the widest discounts we've seen over the last 25 years,'' Mr. Knott said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One segment, mall REITs, is experiencing even sharper discounts of 26 percent on average, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, REITs, by their nature, offer higher-than-average dividend yields. Under REIT rules, companies must distribute at least 90 percent of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends to avoid paying most corporate taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average REIT dividend at the end of September was 4.4 percent, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts</span>. Certain sectors of the REIT universe offer even loftier yields, such as health care REITs, whose dividend yields average 5.8 percent, and mortgage REITs, whose yields average a whopping 11.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, the buyback program and dividend yields make REITs a tempting alternative for investors looking for a breather from the market's roller coaster ride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The U.S. REITs are now trading at double-digit discounts to NAV'' -- net asset value -- ''and have pretty attractive yields relative to the broader market and to fixed income,'' said Ritson Ferguson, chief executive of CBRE's Clarion Securities unit, which holds shares in REITs. ''This looks attractive to me, especially since the underlying business is quite good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, it sounds like a no-brainer: Jittery investors could park cash in REITs, enjoy stock price gains from the buybacks, and collect a hefty dividend while riding out the geopolitical storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To the extent that someone is looking at a cheap entry point into owning good real estate, this is a very good time,'' said Anthony Paolone, an executive director at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But REITs, like other investments, come with risk. And experts caution investors not to blindly jump into those that promise the biggest buybacks or the frothiest yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors need to scrutinize an individual REIT's debt, cash flow and credit rating to ensure that a buyback program will not push a company's leverage -- debt and preferred stock -- into dangerous territory and that its dividend is not at risk of being cut. The best picks are those that trade at discounts of at least 20 percent, have leverage under 40 percent, have investment-grade ratings and plan to sell properties to pay for a buyback program rather than borrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Knott of Green Street Advisors is keen on high-end mall REITs, such as <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span> and <span class="companylink">Taubman Centers</span>. Both trade at big discounts and have aggressively bought back shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts also like <span class="companylink">Host Hotels &amp; Resorts</span> and <span class="companylink">CBL &amp; Associates Properties</span>, a retailing REIT. When they announced buyback programs, Host was trading at a 25 percent discount to net asset value, and <span class="companylink">CBL</span> was trading at a 30 percent discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, experts questioned <span class="companylink">Brandywine Realty Trust</span>'s buyback program. Brandywine, an office REIT that unveiled a $100 million buyback program in July, already has high leverage and a rating below investment grade, which could worsen with the buyback, Mr. Marks of <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the risk from rising interest rates. ''REITs are perceived as interest rate sensitive,'' Mr. Knott said. Investors dumped REIT shares over the last few quarters over concerns about when -- and by how much -- the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will raise rates. REIT total returns, which include dividends, are off 6.3 percent through the end of September 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs constantly need access to cheap money to acquire and develop properties in order to grow. In general, rising rates mean higher borrowing costs, which can cut into a REIT's profits and valuation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, as rates rise, those sparkling REIT dividend yields will not look as shiny anymore as the spread between REITs and bonds tightens. ''REIT equities are viewed primarily as yield investments, and so as interest rates rise, the attractiveness of the REIT dividend yield goes down,'' Mr. Marks said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But analysts say Fed rate increases, when they do come, will be slower and smaller than in past cycles, given the sluggish United States economic recovery, low oil prices and uncertainty in China. They most likely will not have a material impact on REITs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts contend the rate risk is overblown and REITs have been oversold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's already been baked into REIT pricing,'' said Mr. Ferguson at Clarion Securities. ''That's why this buying opportunity has opened up.'' He added that REITs are on track to generate earnings growth of 7 percent on average in 2015 on top of the 4 percent dividend yield: ''That's a pretty nice total return prospect.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction companies built more apartment complexes in September, resulting in a temporary rise in housing starts for a real estate market that otherwise appeared to have crested during the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts last month rose 6.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million homes, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. But a 17 percent surge in multifamily housing -- which includes apartments -- accounts for almost all of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction and sales of existing homes surged in the first half of the year as more Americans found work and the unemployment rate dipped to a solid 5.1 percent. But tight inventories, rising prices and the absence of meaningful wage growth have capped growth as affordability has become an issue -- a problem that new construction can help resolve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Builders are stepping up to meet that demand but doing so cautiously,'' said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. ''So, for beleaguered buyers who can't find what they are looking for because of a dearth of listings, there is a bit of help on the way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction rose last month in the Northeast, South and West, while falling in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts have soared 12 percent in the first nine months of 2015. But the pace of building retreated from its June apex, in part because of the expiration of tax incentives for developers in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approved permits fell 5 percent in September to an annual rate of 1.1 million, a sign that construction will slow in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes similarly accelerated through the start of the summer, only to decline in August. The tight inventories -- just 5.2 months' supply of homes were listed for sale -- have propped up prices. The median cost to buy a home increased 4.7 percent over the year, to $228,700, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A greater share of the country is also choosing to rent. The percentage of Americans owning homes has dipped to 63.4 percent, the lowest level in 48 years. The influx of millennials and downsizing baby boomers into the rental market has caused monthly leases to jump 3.8 percent over the last year, according to the real estate firm Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many Americans lack the income to spend more on housing. Average hourly earnings have increased just 2.2 percent to $25.09, meaning that home values and rental costs are rising at roughly double the rate of incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs that more Americans are renovating their homes instead of buying new properties. A new index compiled by BuildZoom -- which identifies contractors for projects -- found that renovations are running 2.8 percent above their 2005 level. Despite the gains of the last year, new home construction remains 57 percent below its 2005 level during the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, remodeling activity has been flat during the last year as new home construction has advanced. The gains have left construction firms more optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released on Monday rose this month to 64. The last time the reading was higher was October 2005 at 68.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readings above 50 indicate more builders view sales conditions as good rather than poor.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A million dollars doesn't buy what it used to in Manhattan. A combination of high demand and too few listings pushed the median sales price for a Manhattan apartment to just shy of a million dollars in the third quarter of the year, setting a record high, according to several market reports to be released on Thursday by major real estate brokerage firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price, which reflects the middle of the market and is less affected by high-end sales, was $999,000, according to a report by <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. Reports from other brokerage firms, using different figures and methodologies, put the median price at or just below the million-dollar mark, with most calling it a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems like a lot of money anyplace else,'' said Dottie Herman, chief executive of Douglas Elliman Real Estate, which calculated a median price of $998,000. In Manhattan, ''what you get for a million dollars is not a lot of space,'' she said, pointing out that buyers on a budget must turn to New York's other boroughs or to the suburbs to find better values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After rising incrementally over the course of last year, inventory has essentially been flat since January, said Jonathan J. Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and the author of the <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> report. In the third quarter, Mr. Miller said, there were 5,654 available listings, approximately 20 percent below the 10-year average of 7,047 available listings. ''That creates price pressure,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also makes for rapid-fire sales. The amount of time that listings spent on the market fell 20 percent to a record low of 73 days in the third quarter, according to the <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> report. ''You have to be very competitive and you have to be quick,'' especially at the lower end of the market, Ms. Herman said. ''I tell people, 'You really have to have your ducks in order financially and know the market yourself.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the number of closed sales was up for the quarter, driven by robust closings in new development. While prices remained high across all market segments, the average sales price for the luxury market, defined as the top 10 percent of closed sales, dropped 12 percent in the third quarter, to $6.73 million, compared with $7.68 million during the same period last year, as fewer luxury properties closed, according to the Corcoran report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest third-quarter sale was in new development: a $37.9 million penthouse at the Charles condominium at 1355 First Avenue on the Upper East Side. In the resale market, there were only two recorded sales of more than $20 million: a $30 million co-op at 1040 Fifth Avenue, also on the Upper East Side, and a $22 million apartment at 15 Central Park West, on the Upper West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers may be reaching a breaking point when it comes to outsize prices for luxury real estate. ''At the upper end of the market, I believe there is a little bit of a pushback from the buyers,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, chief executive of Halstead Property, which found that the average sales price of co-ops with at least three bedrooms declined 26 percent to approximately $3.1 million in the third quarter of the year, from $4.2 million during the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hall F. Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens Residential Sales, said that though demand remained strong, ''more sellers are asking prices that are just not justified.'' Especially at the high end, he said, ''there's a glut of inventory that's overpriced.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, most brokerage firms expect that prices will continue to increase and inventory will remain in short supply as the end of the year approaches. Gregory J. Heym, chief economist for Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens, said that while concerns about potential stock market turmoil, a slowing Chinese economy and the possibility of rising interest rates ''could have an impact in the fourth quarter, if you look at the fundamentals, we don't see supply and demand changing on a broad basis.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with an anticipated rise in new development inventory in the next several months, Mr. Heym said, ''supply is still at a very low level, and the city's economy is humming along and rates are still low.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything that's been driving the market over the last couple of years is still in place,'' he added.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home prices in the United States rose at a solid pace in July, as would-be buyers competed for a diminished supply of available housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index climbed 5 percent in July from a year earlier. It increased at a 4.9 percent annual pace in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose in the 20 cities in the index over the last 12 months. San Francisco posted the biggest gain, 10.4 percent, followed by Denver, with 10.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steady job growth and an economic recovery in its seventh year have encouraged more Americans to buy homes. That lifted sales to an eight-year high in July. Yet those buyers have bid up prices in many areas because the number of homes for sale remains limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current housing inventory is equal to 5.2 months of sales. Six months is typical in a balanced housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gains were much smaller in many Eastern and Midwestern cities. Home prices were just 1.7 percent higher in Washington, compared with 12 months earlier, and only 1.8 percent higher in Chicago. New York was up merely 1.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Svenja Gudell, chief economist at the real estate data firm Zillow, said the housing market continued to improve despite some conflicting trends. ''The market is continuing to heal and find its footing in a new environment, one where highly local factors matter more than national trends,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index covers roughly half of American homes. The index measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The July figures are the latest available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consistent price gains can make homeowners feel wealthier and more likely to spend, providing a boost to the economy. Higher home values also reduce the number of Americans who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, a condition known as being ''under water.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, housing faces several challenges in the coming months. Prices are rising at more than double the rate of wages, which have increased just 2.2 percent in the last 12 months. That is probably pricing many would-be buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while mortgage rates are still low, they could be headed up soon. The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, has indicated that the central bank may raise short-term rates for the first time in nine years before the end of the year. That would eventually push up mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American consumers were feeling more confident again this month, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>, a business research group, also said on Tuesday. Its consumer confidence index rose again, to 103 in September, after surging in August to 101.3. The September reading was the highest one since January. Economists expected the index to fall this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The surprising improvement in confidence suggests that the recent international turbulence has had little impact on consumers' domestic confidence,'' the economist Bricklin Dwyer of <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> wrote in a research note. ''We expect consumption to continue to expand at a solid pace throughout the end of 2015.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' assessment of present economic conditions hit the highest level in eight years. More than 25 percent of Americans said jobs were plentiful, the highest since September 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expectations for the future fell slightly. Compared to August, however, a bigger share of Americans said they were planning to buy cars and homes over the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, another gauge of consumers' spirits, the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>'s consumer sentiment index, fell this month to the lowest level in almost a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Curtin, chief economist for the Michigan survey, attributed the drop to worries that troubles overseas will hurt hiring and wages in the United States.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of United States business investment plans fell slightly in August, while the number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits barely rose last week. Both reports were taken as signs that global headwinds were doing little to impede American economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economic data released on Thursday showed that new home sales rose in August to the highest level since early 2008, further evidence that the domestic economy was on the upswing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said orders of capital goods excluding military wares and aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.2 percent last month, a slightly bigger decline than analysts polled by Reuters had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But August's decline came after a gain in July that was the largest in over a year. That increase bolstered optimism that many American companies were unfazed by weak overseas markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent trend in orders is a good sign for economic growth in the third quarter after business investment in equipment fell in the April-June period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Investment in equipment appears to be recovering,'' said Paul Ashworth, an economist for the research firm Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable goods over all fell 2 percent in August, in line with forecasts and held back by a sharp decline in orders for civilian aircraft. Excluding the transportation industry, orders were flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some business sectors are being hit by falling commodity prices, though. <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> said on Thursday that it might close or consolidate more than 20 plants around the world across its three large businesses -- construction, resources, and energy and transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> also cut its 2015 revenue forecast and said it could cut up to 10,000 jobs through 2018, joining a list of big industrial companies grappling with the shock waves from a mining and energy downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the Labor Department showed that initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 267,000 for the week that ended Sept. 19. Analysts expected new claims to rise more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of jobless claims fell by 750, to 271,750, which was close to its lowest level since 2000 and suggested that the job market continued to strengthen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robust job growth over the last year has helped the country's housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes surged 5.7 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 552,000, the Commerce Department said. That is the strongest pace since February 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gain was much larger than analysts had expected and came after a strong revision in the pace of sales during July to 12 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday morning, the government will release its third reading of gross domestic product in the second quarter.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in the United States slid in August at the steepest pace since January as tight supplies and rising prices discouraged potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell 4.8 percent from the previous month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.31 million, the lowest level since April, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Monday. That's down from 5.58 million in July, which was the highest in more than eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solid job growth and low mortgage rates have pushed sales 6.2 percent higher in the last year. But the median home price has increased 4.7 percent during that time, more than double the increase in average hourly pay. That is likely to be pushing more homes out of reach for many buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales are expected to remain flat for much of the rest of the year, according to the Realtors' group and some private economists. The Realtors' group forecasts that sales will be 5.3 million this year, the most since the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were signs of fundamental improvement in the housing market. First-time home buyers, a critical source of demand, made up 32 percent of sales last month, up from 28 percent in July. That is still below historical averages of nearly 40 percent. And foreclosures and short sales -- where the seller owes more than the house is worth -- fell to the lowest level in nearly seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Given stronger job growth, and low rates that are going to be sticking around for at least a little while longer, the U.S. housing market is still in good shape,'' said Jennifer Lee, an economist at <span class="companylink">BMO Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Americans looking to buy a home also have fewer to choose from. The number of available homes has fallen 1.7 percent in the last 12 months to just 2.29 million. That is equivalent to 5.2 months of supply at the current sales pace, below the six months that is typical of a balanced market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales may remain steady in the coming months because <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> policy makers last Thursday decided against raising the short-term interest rate they control. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span> has held its benchmark rate at nearly zero since December 2008 in an effort to spur more borrowing and spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has kept mortgage rates quite low for most of the six years since the recession. The rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage averaged just 3.9 percent nationwide last week, according to the mortgage buyer <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Home sales had plunged to an annual rate of just four million when the Fed pegged its rate to zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it's not clear that a rate increase by the Fed -- which may come at its next meetings in either October or December -- will have that great an impact on sales, at least in the short run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nela Richardson, chief economist at the real estate broker Redfin, says most home buyers are not likely to be deterred by a small increase in mortgage rates. More buyers are worried about qualifying for a mortgage to begin with. ''People are not that concerned that a rate hike will torpedo their plans to buy a house,'' Ms. Richardson said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of underwater mortgage holders -- those who owe more than their homes are worth -- has dropped by more than half since peaking in early 2012, according to new data from Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline was driven by rising home values at the lower end of the market, a turnaround from last year. Condominiums were the exception, as their values continued to lag nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of the second quarter of 2015, Zillow's data, which was released earlier this month, showed that 14.4 percent of homeowners with a mortgage had negative equity, compared with 31.4 percent in the first quarter of 2012, the peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the current rate is still a long way from the historically normal negative equity level of around 2 percent, it is markedly lower than the nearly 17 percent rate at the end of last year. The negative equity rate did not budge in the second half of 2014, after dropping steadily for 10 consecutive quarters, because of declining values of lower-priced homes. Another Zillow report released in March had identified 21 major housing markets in which values for the bottom 10 percent of homes were falling, rather than rising. Since then, continued demand for affordable homes coupled with low inventory has helped increase values in the bottom third of homes, lifting more homeowners out of negative territory, said Svenja Gudell, the chief economist of Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the largest 35 metropolitan areas, the highest levels of negative equity were in Las Vegas (25 percent), Chicago (22 percent) and Atlanta (21 percent). New York fell just below the national average, with an overall rate of 12 percent. As in many markets, however, a wide gap separated the negative equity rates at the upper and lower ends of the New York market. About 23 percent of homeowners in the bottom third of homes (by value) were underwater, compared with just 5 percent in the top third, Ms. Gudell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, condominium owners are still more likely to be underwater than owners of single-family homes. The negative equity rate for condo owners with a mortgage was 19.3 percent in the second quarter of this year, compared with 14 percent for single-family owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gudell said several factors were working to slow a condominium comeback. First, as an affordable alternative to single-family houses in many markets, condos tend to be concentrated in the bottom price tier, which has been slower to come back in general. Nationally, about half of all condos are in the bottom third of homes by value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, Ms. Gudell said, the recession hit the condo market hard. The owners ''were often folks who stretched their dollars to buy a starter home and were more likely to default,'' she said. And multiple foreclosures within developments can drive down values for all units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The metro-area markets with the highest levels of negative equity for condominiums were Las Vegas (37 percent), Chicago (33 percent) and Orlando (30 percent). The New York metropolitan area (which includes the city, Long Island, northern New Jersey and Westchester) was well below the national average, with 13 percent of condo and co-op owners underwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers should not interpret the higher rates of negative equity among condo owners as a sign that condos are a bad investment, Ms. Gudell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, ''their values are now growing faster than values for single-family homes,'' she said, partly because so many owners remain underwater that the supply of units for sale is limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, she added, their locations often make them an attractive option, particularly when they are convenient to public transportation and downtown areas.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Builders broke ground on fewer houses and apartment complexes in August, a possible sign that the housing market may be leveling off after accelerating for much of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts last month fell 3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.13 million homes, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Construction activity slowed sharply last month in the Northeast and Midwest, edged downward in the West and climbed in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, homebuilding seems much stronger than a year ago, despite monthly figures that can be highly volatile. Construction slowed in part because of the expiration of tax incentives for developers in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a mere blip on the radar,'' said Tom Wind, executive vice president of home lending at EverBank. ''The housing market's underlying fundamentals remain on pace for continued recovery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts have climbed a solid 11.3 percent this year to date. Steady job gains of 2.9 million in the last 12 months are contributing to increased demand from buyers and renters. And as the recovery from the recession has entered its seventh year, residential construction has reflected and fueled broader economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers see favorable demographics helping to sustain demand: Approved permits rose 3.5 percent in August to an annual rate of 1.17 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction has yet to fully satisfy demand, a sign that further building will most likely remain profitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a 5.2-month supply of new homes is listed for sale, well below the standard level of six months usually documented in a healthy market. This shortage has led to rising prices for new and existing homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, median rental prices are rising annually at 4.2 percent -- roughly double the increase in average hourly wages -- as baby boomers downsize and millennials enter the job market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans commonly -- and mistakenly -- believe that well-to-do black people no longer face the kind of discrimination that prevents them from living anywhere they can afford. But a federal housing discrimination complaint filed last week by the <span class="companylink">National Fair Housing Alliance</span> shows that this toxic problem is very much with us, nearly 50 years after Congress outlawed housing discrimination in the Fair Housing Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complaint, and the investigations that led to it, shows how real estate agents promote segregation -- and deny African-Americans the opportunity to buy into high-value areas that would provide better educations for children and a greater return on their investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the course of nearly a year, the alliance reports, black and white testers posing as home buyers had drastically different experiences when they contacted a real estate company near Jackson, Miss. Agents often declined to show properties to black customers who were better qualified than whites, with higher incomes, better credit scores and more savings for down payments. Meanwhile, white testers who had expressed interest in properties in the majority-black city of Jackson were steered into majority-white communities elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These problems are not limited to the South. Indeed, another alliance investigation covering a dozen metropolitan areas, including Atlanta, Austin, Birmingham, Chicago, Dayton, Detroit, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburg, San Antonio and the District of Columbia, suggests that housing market discrimination is universal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite being better qualified financially, black and Latino testers were shown fewer homes than their white peers, were often denied information about special incentives that would have made the purchase easier, and were required to produce loan pre-approval letters and other documents when whites were not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, real estate agents enforced residential and school segregation by steering home buyers into neighborhoods based on race. Whites were encouraged to live where the schools were mainly white; African-Americans where schools were disproportionately black; and Latinos where schools were disproportionately Latino.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This behavior is reminiscent of the practices used by the real estate industry in the early 20th century that created ghettos for blacks regardless of income. As the black population grew in Northern cities, realty agents developed a variety of tools for isolating black families, including contracts that barred owners from renting or selling to ''outsiders'' -- always a code for African-Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, created during the New Deal to promote homeownership, openly supported these racist measures; it forbade lending to black people even as it subsidized white families that moved from the cities to the suburbs. Cut off from fairly priced home loan credit, black neighborhoods deteriorated and their values plummeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many discriminatory practices were formally ended with the civil rights and fair lending laws of the 1960s and 70s. But these were quickly replaced by subtler techniques that encouraged ghettoization, like channeling black families away from white areas and banks' and mortgage brokers' systematically pushing middle-income black families into high-cost, high-risk loans when they could have qualified for more affordable loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This history of discrimination has taken an enormous toll on black wealth, as is shown in research by Douglas Massey and Jonathan Tannen at Princeton University's Office of Population Research. In 1970, two years after the passage of the Fair Housing Act, for example, the average well-off black American lived in a neighborhood where potential home wealth, as measured by property values, stood at about only $50,000 -- as opposed to $105,000 for affluent whites and $56,000 for poor whites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2010, affluent African-Americans had passed poor whites in potential home wealth but had fallen further behind affluent whites. There is more than money at stake, Mr. Massey and Mr. Tannen write, because home values ''translate directly into access to higher quality education given that public schools in the United States are financed by real estate taxes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout history, ethnic groups have been able to translate economic gains into housing in better neighborhoods and advantages for their children. But for African-Americans, the researchers write, that transition has been ''thwarted by segregation and the prejudice and discrimination that create and maintain it.'' In other words, the damage reaches across generations and continues today.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDTo understand the feeling of crisis that many see in higher education right now, it's useful to start with some figures from 40 years ago. In 1974, the median American family earned just under $13,000 a year. A new home could be had for $36,000, an average new car for $4,400. Attending a four-year private college cost around $2,000 a year: affordable, with some scrimping, to even median earners. As for public university, it was a bargain at $510 a year. To put these figures in current dollars, we're talking about median family income of $62,000, a house for $174,000 and a sticker price of $21,300 for the car, $10,300 for the private university and $2,500 for the public one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot has changed since then. Median family income has risen slightly, to about $64,000, while median home prices have increased by about two-thirds. (Car prices have remained steady.) But the real outlier is higher education. Tuition at a private university is now roughly three times as expensive as it was in 1974, costing an average of $31,000 a year; public tuition, at $9,000, has risen by nearly four times. This is a painful bill for all but the very richest. For the average American household that doesn't receive a lot of financial aid, higher education is simply out of reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tackling this crisis is now a political issue. President Obama has proposed making community college available to nearly every American. Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley have all announced plans to increase federal funding for college, if elected. Those on the right are also offering solutions, though they tend to consider government spending part of the problem. Donald Trump says he will cut the Department of Education ''way, way, way down.'' Scott Walker successfully cut $250 million from Wisconsin's budget for higher education. Jeb Bush has focused far more attention on primary and secondary education -- opposing tenure for teachers, advocating ''school choice'' -- but he promotes his cutting back of affirmative action in Florida's public universities as an example of reducing government's role in education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher education is a fascinating, complex business. Its pricing dynamics ripple throughout the rest of our economy, in effect determining who will thrive and who will fail. What's more, the product of this particular industry is not just an end in itself. Education can have enormous personal benefits for those who acquire it, but it also has external benefits to the rest of society. Education exerts something of a multiplier effect; it transforms not only the lives of the educated but of those around them as well. Workers with more education are more productive, which makes companies more profitable and the overall economy grow faster. There are also significant noneconomic benefits. Educated populations tend to be healthier, more stable and more engaged in their civic institutions and democratic debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For young adults from educated, middle-class families -- the people who will find a way to get through college despite the costs -- rising college tuition is a personal challenge. But the great national crisis is the fact that too many other young adults are not going to college or, if they do, don't graduate, in large part because they can't afford it. Every American benefits when every other American has access to as much schooling as he or she wants. When accessibility to higher education declines, we all end up paying for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 21 million students attend at least some classes in a postsecondary institution. Like many categories of consumer products, though, colleges and universities do not constitute a single, cohesive market. The larger industry can be broke down into at least three distinct higher-education markets whose offerings, customers and business priorities share little overlap. One of them comprises the 200 or so highly selective schools with national, and even international, reputations. These include the most elite schools, like the Ivies, but also any private institution with especially strong brand recognition. Such schools enroll between 2 percent and 10 percent of all postsecondary students, depending on how ''elite'' is defined, and taken together they show all the hallmarks of a well-functioning competitive market. They vie with one another for the best students in the country and the world. Huge amounts of information about them are readily available to consumers, so it is very unlikely that any of them could deceive potential students about the benefits of the degrees they offer. The enormous financial value (and cultural currency) of the product they are selling, an elite credential, is well understood. Nearly everybody admitted to these schools graduates within four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next educational marketplace consists of the large regional powerhouses, home to another 20 percent or so of the higher-ed student population. Usually public, with names that often begin with ''University of,'' these schools have strong reputations in their home states and often among the residents in neighboring states. The best ones are more likely to be found in the South or West. Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz, both professors at <span class="companylink">Harvard</span> and leading scholars of education economics, co-wrote a famous paper a few years ago in which they pointed out that states that had elite private schools in the 1890s are less likely to have developed these strong, upper-­tier public schools. The reason is as obvious as it is depressing: The powerful private schools lobbied politicians to keep public institutions underfunded. That helps explain why the university systems in North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, California and elsewhere outside the Northeast are held in such high regard. (The <span class="companylink">University of Massachusetts</span> and <span class="companylink">SUNY</span> systems, by contrast, do not have the same reputations.) Public universities have always been cheaper than their elite private counterparts, but the gap has been closing slowly as states stop funding the schools as generously as they once did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, there are the nonselective public, community and private for-profit colleges that admit nearly every paying applicant. A vast majority of people pursuing postsecondary education will start in these schools. They vary greatly in quality. Some provide a solid education, especially in technical expertise, that can lead to higher-paying, skilled jobs in manufacturing, health care and other fields. Some of these places, especially the private for-profit ones, seem to be little more than a scam, recruiting students, taking their government-funded loans and offering them a degree of minimal worth. Well more than half of all new students at four-year schools in this segment won't finish. But still they will be burdened with debt or will default, leaving taxpayers to foot the bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If colleges and universities were just another consumer good, like cars or clothes, we wouldn't worry as much about their cost. The rich pay more for the best stuff; the poor pay less for the worst. That's the market at work. But higher education is both an individual and a public concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We know this from historical experience. In 1900, less than 10 percent of the U.S. population had a high-school degree, and many couldn't have received one if they wanted. There just weren't enough public high schools. In the beginning of the 20th century, a nationwide effort was undertaken to provide free secondary schooling to every American child. By the end of World War II, half of all young American adults had high-school diplomas; by the 1970s, a vast majority did. The country's rapid growth during that century -- the rise of industry, the development of technology, the dawn of a vast middle class -- would be hard to explain without acknowledging the spread of education as a cause. From 1900 to 1980, every generation born in the United States had about two more years of schooling than the one before. This transformed a nation of semiliterate farmers into the world's most-educated country. But progress has slowed since 1980. In the 1970s, the United States ranked first globally for college attainment; today, among people 25 to 34, it ranks 14th, having fallen behind many other industrialized nations. The <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span> has singled out the United States as being particularly deficient in one measure: the chances are greater than 70 percent that an American will not attend college if his or her parents do not have a college degree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This history was laid out most clearly in the 2008 book ''The Race Between Education and Technology,'' by Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz, which transformed how economists think about education, individual success and our collective fortunes. Put simply: Without greater access to higher education, the United States is likely to have even greater income inequality, a huge segment of the population will see its income fall and some of our core assumptions about national identity -- ours as a land of opportunity, a prosperous democracy -- will be at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the 1980s, most states have decreased their per-student spending on public higher education, some of them quite substantially. Federal aid has risen, but not enough to make up for the state cuts and significant increases in enrollment. Tuition, meanwhile, has gone up far more than inflation. For an explanation why that's so, it's helpful to identify analogues in the business world. Like hotels and apartment buildings, for example, colleges and universities own expensive real estate that is parceled out for use by paying customers; this means the overall rise in real estate costs have made running a university more expensive. Like airlines or <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, they have a wide variety of customers with varying ability and willingness to pay. First-class and latte customers can be seduced into paying top dollar, but much of the revenue comes from people who can't afford the fancy stuff and just want a seat in coach or a cup of coffee. Like sports teams or, for that matter, cigarette companies, schools obsessively tend to their reputations, hoping to build lifelong brand loyalty among their most fervent customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But probably the single most important factor behind the rise in tuition is one that few other businesses share: Students are not just customers; they are also an integral part of the core product. When considering a school, potential students and their parents often look first at the characteristics of past classes: test scores, grade-point averages, post-college earnings, as well as ethnic and gender mixes. School admissions officers call the process through which they put together their classes the ''shaping'' of the student body. Kevin Crockett is a consultant with Ruffalo Noel Levitz, a firm that helps colleges and universities set prices. He says that the higher the prices that schools charge, the more options they have in recruiting exactly the students they want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've got to have enough room under the top-line sticker price,'' he says. A school that charges $50,000 is able to offer a huge range of inducements to different sorts of students: some could pay $10,000, others $30,000 or $40,000. And a handful can pay the full price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a provocative analogy to be made with how another industry does its pricing. I called Paul Norman, who owns a company that promotes high-end dance clubs in London, and he agrees that his clubs have much the same challenge as colleges and universities. Their appeal to new customers is based, in large part, on the mix of customers who are already there. The biggest spenders are wealthy men from Russia and the Middle East. But they won't spend a lot of money in a club filled with people just like themselves. Women who have the right look -- posh in Chelsea, a bit more flash in Mayfair -- are admitted free and are offered free drinks, but only if they arrive early in the evening and happily mingle and dance. He said that clubs do their own version of enrollment shaping. ''It's good for the crowds if you have a mix of ethnicities,'' Norman told me. On any given night, he said, about a quarter of the clubs' guests get in free. It's an odd model: giving your most valuable product away to some and charging a lot to others. But, Norman said, if everybody paid the same price, nobody would want to come, and in a few weeks clubs wouldn't be able to charge anyone anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, if an elite school like <span class="companylink">Harvard</span> or Princeton insisted on admitting only students willing to pay the full freight, they would soon find they weren't so elite. Many of the best teachers would rather go elsewhere than stay in a gated, rich community. The most accomplished rich kids could be lured away to other schools by the prospect of studying with the best students and teachers. So, a school with the same high sticker price for everyone would be unlikely to have the attributes -- high test scores, Nobel Prize-winning faculty, a lively culture -- that draw national or international attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While blue-chip schools charge the most, their economic fundamentals suggest that they are, if anything, underpricing their product. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average bill at the top-tier schools is just over $50,000 a year. Yet these schools spend considerably more than $100,000 a year educating each student, with the difference made up from government funds, grants, alumni gifts and their often-huge endowments. Fewer than half of their students pay even that discounted amount. Most of the top-tier private schools say they won't factor in an applicant's ability to pay when considering admission and promise that everyone admitted will be given the financial aid necessary to attend. Generally, parents pay no more than 10 percent of their income. Students whose parents make less than $65,000 (or, at Stanford, $125,000) usually pay no tuition. And there are generous aid packages available to all but the very wealthiest students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pricing of college and university tuition used to be based on gut feelings, Crockett told me. Until around 1992, administrators would glance at what their peers were charging and come up with a number. Today, the process involves a level of mathematical and statistical rigor that few other industries could match. Crockett uses a team of statisticians and data analysts, the latest in software and data with hundreds of variables on students' ability and willingness to pay, academic accomplishments, most likely choices of majors, ethnicity and gender, and other attributes. To the public, one number is released: the cost of tuition. But internally the school likely has dozens of price points, each set for a different group of potential students. The tools can determine how valuable a potential student is to the school's overall reputation: more points for sports and scholarly accomplishment, fewer for the telltale signs of a likely dropout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because a majority of selective schools have adopted these sophisticated tools for shaping enrollment, there is more competition to attract the students who are most appealing: those with high G.P.A.s and test scores, high likelihood of graduating, the right sort of major -- English majors, for example, effectively subsidize engineering students because engineering is more expensive to teach. Typically, fierce market competition leads to lower prices, but among elite schools, the opposite occurs, paradoxically. They often find that raising prices enables them to offer greater benefits to the most coveted potential students. (It also allows them to take part in the amenities race: nicer dorms, better food, a climbing wall: things that are regarded as essential to attracting those coveted students.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Counterintuitively, the surest way to improve equality of access to elite schools might be to raise the cost of admission even further. Rich students paying the full price would make more aid, in money and educational support, available to be transferred to the best students from poor families and lower-performing schools. For most people who graduate from top-tier schools, debt is easily managed. Their average loan outstanding upon graduation is $23,000, but these students -- no matter what they major in -- get a high wage-premium, making an average of $20,000 a year more than they would have had they not gone to the school. Students entering college today are confronted with far more costs -- the average textbook budget is $1,200 a year now -- and this can be quite shocking to parents for whom college was much more affordable. And there are, no doubt, individual stories of deep hardship. But as a group, students who attend more-selective schools are among the luckiest in our society. In effect, they live in a different economy than the rest of the nation, one with a rich array of career opportunities, steadily rising wages and far less unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The midtier public schools face a different set of challenges. Their tuition increases are being driven largely by state governments' unwillingness or inability to raise per-student financing. Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the <span class="companylink">Urban Institute</span>, says that in the 2001-2002 school year, public schools received from 44 percent to 62 percent of their funding from state governments. Only a decade later, those levels had decreased to 27 percent to 51 percent. On average, states have lowered their per-student funding by 25 percent over the last 15 years. Some -- Louisiana, Wisconsin, Kansas and Arizona -- have cut their support sharply in the past few years. The money allocated for public education is a tempting target for governors facing shortfalls. Education is one of the largest items in a state budget, and educators don't have the same lobbying power as more concentrated business groups. Republican governors with national political aspirations have found that ''taking on'' public education can enhance their popularity among primary voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic thinking behind public-university cuts can be confusing. Studies have shown that cutting support for public education balances budgets only in the short term. In his book ''Higher Learning, Greater Good,'' Walter W. McMahon, emeritus professor of economics at the <span class="companylink">University of Illinois</span>, showed that a postsecondary degree has a return on investment of roughly 15 percent a year, meaning that every $100 invested in education brings an additional $15 in income for every year of a person's working life. This expands a state's economy and generates enough tax revenue to more than pay back the initial outlay on education. Someone who graduates from a four-year institution earns about $1 million in additional future earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flagship public universities -- like the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>, or the Universities of Michigan and Virginia -- often behave like elite private schools, using aid to attract the best students, typically the ones who would probably go to a decent school without government support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means that high-achieving students from educated families receive a disproportionate share of financial assistance, while those at the bottom, struggling students from families ill equipped to support their educations, receive a disproportionately small share. If you add up all the financial aid available from federal, state and local governments and from nonprofit institutions, there is enough money already out there to support everybody's education. The problem is that aid is distributed unevenly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonselective schools, the ones serving our most at-risk and in-need students, are struggling for money. Obama recently proposed making community college free for anyone able to maintain a G.P.A. of 2.5 while in school and whose parents make less than $200,000 a year. The program would be surprisingly cheap, costing around $6 billion annually, a pittance in the federal budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it doesn't fully address the crisis confronting our system of community colleges: Lots of people enter, but most won't graduate. Some four-year schools have truly abysmal records when it comes to graduating their students in six years or less. Medgar Evers College in the <span class="companylink">CUNY</span> system has a graduation rate of 8 percent as of 2013. Entire state public-university systems with collective graduation rates below 50 percent include Arkansas (39.7 percent), Montana (45.6 percent) and Alaska (30.6 percent). Baum says that among nonselective, four-year, for-profit schools, graduation rates above 50 percent are the exception, and a few, especially online schools, have rates well below 10 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly every education expert I spoke to mentioned a remarkable new program that has had the greatest success yet in improving the graduation rate of at-risk college enrollees. The experimental program was introduced at the community colleges of the <span class="companylink">City University of New York</span>, where the overall graduation rate has been as low as 16 percent. CUNY administrators determined that many of their students don't just need cheaper tuition. They need support. Coming from families and communities with few, if any, college graduates, they are poor and every day have to calculate the trade-off between investing in their long-term education and paying their short-term bills. <span class="companylink">CUNY</span>'s Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP) offered some common-sense interventions. Students received help paying their tuition and other fees; they even received free passes for public transportation. Most important, perhaps, they received what the school calls ''mandatory and intrusive guidance'' from counselors who helped them choose classes, get through rough patches and focus on the long-term benefits of finishing school. Three years into the program, an outside education-research firm began an experiment: A group of 900 entering freshmen, all of whom had developmental needs, was randomly assigned to ASAP. They and a comparison group that received no special intervention were monitored for three years. The graduation rate among ASAP students who achieved an associate's degree in three years was twice as great as that of the comparison group. The overall ASAP graduation rate at <span class="companylink">CUNY</span> has risen to 52 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henry Levin, an economist at Columbia University's Teachers College, co-wrote an exhaustive analysis and concluded that, while it costs more upfront -- at $19,000 a student, ASAP isn't cheap -- the benefits to New York taxpayers were great. Those with associate's degrees would earn so much more over their lifetimes that they would pay an estimated $165,000 in additional taxes, while saving the state and city more than $40,000 in criminal justice, health and public-assistance costs. Pilot versions of the program are now being tried at several Ohio schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">College aid -- all the federal and state grants and subsidies, the various scholarships and aid packages offered by schools and foundations -- evolved in piecemeal fashion over decades. Considered as a whole, it is a bizarre system. Students who go to private nonprofit schools, disproportionately children of middle-class and wealthy parents with college educations, receive an average of $25,000 a year in aid. Those who go to less-selective public schools receive an average of $13,500 a year. And students who attend public community colleges, who are most likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds and parents without college degrees, receive an average of $8,000 a year. In other words, our system gives three times as much aid to the least needy as it gives to the most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This makes no economic sense: Once students drop out of community college, taxpayers will continue to pay their bills. That's not called education funding; it's called welfare or criminal-justice or health care expenditures. The difference is significant. In the language of economics, education funding is an investment; it more than pays back its initial costs over time. The other expenses are known as transfer payments; which means they make society poorer. In an economy that demands and rewards education, those who have it will pay the bills for those who don't.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand the feeling of crisis that many see in American higher education right now, it’s useful to start with some figures from 40 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1974, the median American family earned just under $13,000 a year. A new home could be had for $36,000, an average new car for $4,400. Attending a four-year private college cost around $2,000 a year: affordable, with some scrimping, to even median earners. As for public university, it was a bargain at $510 a year. To put these figures in 2015 dollars, we’re talking about median household income of $62,000, a house for $174,000 and a sticker price of $21,300 for the car, $10,300 for the private university and $2,500 for the public one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot has changed since then. Median family income has fallen to about $52,000, while median home prices have increased by about two-thirds.

Well more than half of all new students at four-year schools in this segment won’t finish. But still they will be burdened with debt or will default, leaving taxpayers to foot the bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If colleges and universities were just another consumer good, like cars or clothes, we wouldn’t worry as much about their cost. The rich pay more for the best stuff; the poor pay less for the worst. That’s the market at work. But higher education is both an individual and a public concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We know this from historical experience. In 1900, less than 10 percent of the United States’ population had a high school degree, and many couldn’t have received one if they wanted. There just weren’t enough public high schools. In the beginning of the 20th century, a nationwide effort was undertaken to provide free secondary schooling to every American child. By the end of World War II, half of all young American adults had high school diplomas; by the 1970s, a majority did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country’s rapid growth during that century — the rise of industry, the development of technology, the dawn of a vast middle class — would be hard to explain without acknowledging the spread of education as a cause. From 1900 to 1980, every generation born in the United States had about two more years of schooling than the one before. This transformed a nation of semiliterate farmers into the world’s most-educated country. But progress has slowed since 1980. In the 1970s, the United States ranked first globally for college attainment; today, among people 25 to 34, it ranks 14th, having fallen behind many other industrialized nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the 1980s, most states have decreased their per-student spending on public higher education, some of them quite substantially. Federal aid has risen, but not enough to make up for the state cuts and significant increases in enrollment. Tuition, meanwhile, has gone up far more than inflation. For an explanation why that’s so, it’s helpful to identify analogues in the business world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like hotels and apartment buildings, for example, colleges and universities own expensive real estate that is parceled out for use by paying customers; this means the overall rise in real estate costs have made running a university more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But probably the single most important factor behind the rise in tuition is one that few other businesses share: Students are not just customers; they are also an integral part of the core product. When considering a school, potential students often look first at the characteristics of past classes: test scores, grade-point averages, post-college earnings, and ethnic and gender mixes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">School admissions officers call the process through which they put together their classes the ‘‘shaping’’ of the student body. Kevin Crockett is a consultant with Ruffalo Noel Levitz, a firm that helps colleges and universities set prices. He says that the higher the prices that schools charge, the more options they have in recruiting exactly the students they want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I’ve got to have enough room under the top-line sticker price,’’ he says. A school that charges $50,000 is able to offer a huge range of inducements to different sorts of students: Some could pay $10,000, others $30,000 or $40,000. And a handful can pay the full price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pricing of college and university tuition used to be based on gut feelings, Crockett said. Until around 1992, administrators would glance at what their peers were charging and come up with a number. Today, the process involves a level of mathematical and statistical rigor that few other industries could match. Crockett uses a team of statisticians and data analysts, the latest in software and data with hundreds of variables on students’ ability and willingness to pay, academic accomplishments, most likely choices of majors, ethnicity and gender, and other attributes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the public, one number is released: the cost of tuition. But internally the school is likely to have dozens of price points, each set for a different group of potential students. The tools can determine how valuable a potential student is to the school’s overall reputation: more points for sports and scholarly accomplishment, fewer for the telltale signs of a likely dropout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because a majority of selective schools have adopted these sophisticated tools for shaping enrollment, there is more competition to attract the students who are most appealing. Typically, fierce market competition leads to lower prices, but among elite schools, the opposite occurs, paradoxically. They often find that raising prices enables them to offer greater benefits to the most coveted potential students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Counterintuitively, the surest way to improve equality of access to elite schools might be to raise the cost of admission even further. Rich students paying the full price would make more aid available to be transferred to the best students from poor families and lower-performing schools. For most people who graduate from top-tier schools, debt is easily managed. Their average loan outstanding upon graduation is $23,000, but these students — no matter what they major in — get a high wage-premium, making an average of $20,000 a year more than they would have had they not gone to the school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The midtier public schools face a different set of challenges. Their tuition increases are being driven largely by state governments’ unwillingness or inability to raise per-student financing. On average, states have lowered their per-student funding by 25 percent over the past 15 years. The money allocated for public education is a tempting target for governors facing shortfalls. Education is one of the largest items in a state budget, and educators don’t have the same lobbying power as more concentrated business groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But studies have shown that cutting support for public education balances budgets only in the short term. In his book ‘‘Higher Learning, Greater Good,’’ Walter W. McMahon, emeritus professor of economics at the University of Illinois, showed that a postsecondary degree has a return on investment of roughly 15 percent a year, meaning that every $100 invested in education brings an additional $15 in income for every year of a person’s working life. This expands a state’s economy and generates enough tax revenue to more than pay back the initial outlay on education. Someone who graduates from a four-year institution earns about $1 million in additional future earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flagship public universities — like the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>, or the Universities of Michigan and Virginia — often behave like elite private schools, using aid to attract the best students, typically the ones who would probably go to a decent school without government support. That means that high-achieving students from educated families receive a disproportionate share of financial assistance, while those at the bottom, struggling students from families ill equipped to support their educations, receive a disproportionately small share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonselective schools, the ones serving our most at-risk and in-need students, are struggling for money. President Obama recently proposed making community college free for anyone able to maintain a grade point average of 2.5 while in school and whose parents make less than $200,000 a year. The program would be surprisingly cheap, costing around $6 billion annually, a pittance in the federal budget. Still, it doesn’t fully address the crisis confronting our system of community colleges: Lots of people enter, but most won’t graduate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When students drop out of community college, taxpayers continue to pay their bills. That’s not called education funding; it’s called welfare or criminal-justice or health care expenditures. In an economy that demands and rewards education, those who have it will pay the bills for those who don’t.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As published in the International New York Times</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in the Sept. 12-13 issue about college tuition referred incorrectly to a measure of income in a comparison of 1974 income and current income when adjusted for inflation. It is median family income, which has risen to about $64,000 a year from $62,000 in 1974, not median household income. And the article also described incorrectly the change in median family income over the past 40 years. It has risen slightly, not fallen.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA — A Victorian apartment building and hotel that once housed the wealthy but later became a symbol of urban decay will be reborn as a residential complex in a project aimed at reviving a long-neglected North Philadelphia neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Divine Lorraine Hotel has attracted only pigeons and graffiti artists since its last failed development attempt in the mid-2000s. The latest plans include 109 apartments and 20,000 square feet of ground-floor restaurants and retail outlets that could breathe new life into one of this city’s most notorious eyesores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After long delays in obtaining building permits and historic tax credits, Eric Blumenfeld, the owner and developer of the building, finally closed on financing for the $44 million development on Aug. 31; he expects to formally begin a 16-month construction project in mid-September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development is expected to help revitalize an area that has recently attracted some upscale restaurants and apartment houses, but has not yet fully felt the residential construction boom that is spreading through some other areas of Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blumenfeld, who has developed other nearby residential buildings, predicted that an influx of residents paying $1,900 a month for the new 800-square-foot apartments will allow the neighborhood to catch up with surrounding areas that are already gentrifying. “The Divine Lorraine has always been the tipping point,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other developers and their customers are being attracted to surrounding neighborhoods like Fairmount and Francisville where property prices are rising but are still well below those in upscale areas of downtown Philadelphia like Rittenhouse Square, Mr. Blumenfeld said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building’s prospects are being helped by separate plans for a supermarket and two apartment towers proposed by the RAL Companies, a New York developer, in an empty lot on the east side of the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blumenfeld forecast that his new tenants would be attracted by the building’s position at Broad Street and Fairmount Avenue, midway between City Hall, less than a mile to the south, and <span class="companylink">Temple University</span> to the north, both of which are connected by the Broad Street subway line. To the west, residents on upper floors of the 11-story building will be able to see the <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Museum of Art</span> about a mile away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project is being financed by William Procida, a New Jersey-based real estate financier, who is providing $25 million after tax credits have been taken into account, Mr. Blumenfeld said. Other loans and grants came from the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and PIDC, a public-private economic development group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project is the latest chapter in the life of the building, which was completed in 1894. One of Philadelphia’s first high-rises, it was once home to residents made wealthy by Philadelphia’s manufacturing boom of the early 20th century. It later became the city’s first racially integrated hotel under the ownership of the eponymous Father Jealous Divine, an African-American spiritual leader who bought the property in 1948.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002 but then gutted by the last owner, leaving the bare brick and timbers that are visible inside today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Greenberger, Philadelphia’s deputy mayor for economic development, said the renovation would play an important role in local revitalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It sits right in the middle of the North Broad Street corridor that we want to see redeveloped,” Mr. Greenberger said. “It is a billboard of blight, and things won’t happen around it unless it gets renovated.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An early sign of the project’s positive effects is the planned retail/residential development immediately to the east, which Mr. Greenberger said would not have been proposed without the Divine Lorraine’s face-lift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s no way that people are going to make that kind of investment without the Divine Lorraine getting renovated,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renovation shows that the market on North Broad Street has recovered to the point that would justify the significant investment required, Mr. Greenberger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of growing confidence, other developers have said they would be interested in taking over the Divine Lorraine project if Mr. Blumenfeld were ever unable to continue, Mr. Greenberger said. “It’s not just one developer putting himself out there but the development community suggesting that the time is now,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Silverman, managing director in the Philadelphia office of Integra Realty Resources, a national valuation company, said the Divine Lorraine project had been made possible by the growing availability of both debt and equity capital, by the local activity in multifamily construction and by rising housing demand from Philadelphia’s influx of younger residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It further demonstrates that there is demand for additional development,” Mr. Silverman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the building’s boarded-up windows and graffiti-covered walls have earned it an ugly reputation in recent years, it is a prominent part of the city’s fabric that is treasured by some residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People’s attachment to the building was shown in late July when a local businessman, Najeeb Sheikh, produced a line of merchandise including towels, bathrobes and shampoo bottles imprinted with Divine Lorraine logos, and sold them all in a one-day sale at a store in downtown Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blumenfeld said he first heard about the merchandise from a lawyer who suggested that Mr. Blumenfeld would have grounds to sue Mr. Sheikh for using the Divine Lorraine name without permission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Blumenfeld said he loved the idea, so Mr. Sheikh is now producing a second line of merchandise to sell in the lobby of the building at the groundbreaking ceremony in coming weeks. The new items will include T-shirts for $30, coffee mugs for $10 and backpacks for about $45, all carrying the Divine Lorraine brand, Mr. Sheikh said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he made the first batch of merchandise — which included about 100 pairs of shoes and 100 T-shirts — without knowing anything about the renovation project but because he wanted to “pay homage to the building as a historical landmark.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sheikh attributed the strong demand for his products to the architecture and history of the building, together with its more recent status as a magnet for photographers, graffiti artists and urban explorers of abandoned buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are so many people who are drawn to this building in one way or another,” he said. “I honestly didn’t realize the building meant so much to so many different people until the first collection came out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said his customers included people who recalled their relatives living or working in the building and wanted a piece of the merchandise as a memento for surviving family members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visitors to the first merchandise sale included an woman who said she had lived in the building starting in the 1960s and fondly recalled its traditions including women having to be modestly dressed and sleeping on separate floors from the men, Mr. Sheikh said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recognition of their conversation, Mr. Sheikh said he gave the woman a key chain, a part of the merchandise collection, which was randomly imprinted with the number 215. That happened to be the number of the woman’s room in the building, a discovery that brought her to tears. “At that moment, I realized just how special the building is,” Mr. Sheikh said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sudden reversal in United States stock prices late in trading on Tuesday produced a sixth consecutive session of losses and heightened uncertainty about the challenges facing global markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wild swings in prices over the last two days have been the most extreme since the financial crisis. The benchmark <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index surged as much as 2.9 percent on Tuesday, but ended down 1.4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resurgence of volatility has overturned a sense of comfort among many investors who had grown accustomed to calm markets and steadily rising stock prices in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the market turmoil may not yet be flashing warning signs about the United States economy, which still appears to be strengthening, it is pushing investors to take a closer look at their portfolios. Stock prices have generally been rising faster than the profits of corporate America, and that is prompting caution. Even after the recent downturn, investors are still paying more for corporate profits than they have on average over the last 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The last two days have been a wake-up call for a lot of portfolio managers,'' said Nicholas Colas, the chief market strategist at Convergex, an institutional brokerage firm. ''It forces everyone to reconsider their base assumption for things like earnings growth and revenue growth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opening of trading in Asia on Wednesday brought little clarity. Shanghai stocks, which have led the declines over the past few days, swung between gains and losses, and the volatile trading spread across the rest of Asia. Japanese stocks rebounded from Tuesday's 4 percent drop, but shares in Australia were down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors have taken a dark outlook, questioning whether the markets -- and the broader economy -- will be able to abide a coming rise in interest rates that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> has been moving toward for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the time being, there are few doubts that the American economy has been growing, and the economy is unlikely to be significantly hampered by recent turmoil in China. New data reported on Tuesday morning pointed to a healthy increase in consumer confidence in August and a rise in new home sales in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But voices like Lawrence H. Summers, the former chief economic adviser to President Obama, have recently joined a chorus of skeptics arguing that the growth may not be able to continue if the Fed steps back from the market, as it had looked set to do in September. Investors have ramped up bets this week that the Fed will have to delay any planned changes in interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday provided another reminder of the wide range of outcomes that investors are debating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early on Tuesday, investors in markets around the world appeared to take comfort as China, the epicenter of the recent sell-off in global stock markets, took steps to tackle slowing growth in the world's second-largest economy. The <span class="companylink">Chinese central bank</span> announced measures intended to lower borrowing costs and stimulate the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European markets rose sharply, and when New York trading opened, stocks surged. The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average, which had plunged 1,000 points early on Monday, rose 441 points early on Tuesday in another day of heavy trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That optimism, however, slowly faded. And in the last half-hour of trading, the tentative rally fell apart completely. The Dow closed down 204.91 points, or 1.3 percent, at 15,666.44. The S.&amp;P. 500 ended 25.60 points lower at 1867.61, while the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite index closed down 0.4 percent, or 19.76 points, to 4,506.49.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were no obvious explanations for the sudden decline in prices in the waning minutes of trading, though many investors said it suggested the lack of conviction behind recent market moves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is going to take a week, or a couple of weeks, to have this market stabilize,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, the chief investment officer at the Solaris Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The major stock indexes have all entered into what is known as a correction -- a 10 percent decline from the recent high, reached in May. The new declines brought the indexes closer to a so-called bear market, which is a 20 percent slump from recent highs. The Dow is now down 15.5 percent since May. The pullback has erased all of the gains that American stocks had made since early 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Treasury</span> prices, which have benefited from the instability in stock markets, were weaker on Tuesday. The price of the benchmark 10-year note fell, driving its yield -- which moves in the opposite direction of its price -- to 2.08 percent from 2.01 percent on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big moves this week have struck many strategists as an overreaction, particularly given that there are no new major signs of any turn in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many investors who focus on the value of stocks, as measured by the price paid for each dollar of profit from a company, say that stocks have further to fall still if valuations are to come in line with historical norms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors were paying $16.80 for every dollar of earnings over the last year -- the so-called price-to-earnings ratio -- even after Monday's losses, according to FactSet Research. Over the last 10 years, the ratio has been, on average, $15.70.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we are this high, even with this pullback, the track record of future returns isn't all that good,'' Mr. Colas of Convergex said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last two years investors have bid up the price of stocks in the hope that the companies would experience significant future growth. In recent quarters, though, American corporate profits have been falling on a year-to-year basis. Looking forward, many investors are anticipating slower growth from American companies unless the economy significantly picks up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, all of the negative sentiment could dissolve on Wednesday morning, as it appeared to do for a time on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When American stocks opened on Tuesday, European markets were up sharply, recouping most of the losses they had experienced on Monday. The benchmark German index ended the day up almost 5 percent, while France's benchmark index was up 4.1 percent -- all before the markets in the United States began to experience trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the day, the markets in China posted deep losses, with Shanghai stocks down 7.6 percent following Monday's 8.5 percent plunge. But after the markets closed in China, Beijing officials cut interest rates and reduced the amount of money banks are required to keep on hand to guard against risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves suggested that Chinese authorities are now looking to stabilize the economy, rather than focusing on the problems in the financial markets. But similar past efforts have failed to reverse the country's problems, and many investors are skeptical that the latest measures will be more effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States and Europe, too, there are growing fears that the central bankers have done everything in their power and now need to rely on some outside assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at <span class="companylink">Allianz</span>, wrote on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> that Tuesday's reversal will ''erode the faith that market participants have in the power of central banks to repress volatility.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Data</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several important data points on the United States housing market will be released this week. On Tuesday, a <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span>/Case-Shiller index is likely to show that home prices in 20 cities rose over the year ending in June. Demand for homes is building, pushing up prices. Also on Tuesday, a report from the Commerce Department will probably show that purchases of new homes increased in July after a surprise decrease in June. More good news is expected from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Thursday as the group reports pending sales of existing homes for July. Sales were unexpectedly down in June, but may well have bounced back. —Dionne Searcey</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cholesterol Fighters</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Food and Drug Administration</span> is expected by Thursday to approve Repatha, a powerful cholesterol-lowering drug from <span class="companylink">Amgen</span>. That will set the stage for a market battle with <span class="companylink">Sanofi</span> and <span class="companylink">Regeneron Pharmaceuticals</span>, which won approval for their similar drug, Praluent, last month. Both drugs use the same mechanism and can lower LDL cholesterol, the so-called bad kind, by 40 percent or more beyond what can be achieved with statins like Lipitor. Insurers hope competition will lower costs. Praluent’s list price is $14,600 a year, prompting concerns that these new drugs will strain health plan budgets. —Andrew Pollack</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fit Topic for the Fed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, is skipping the annual gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., which runs Thursday through Saturday. But other Fed officials, including the vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, will be on hand for the conference, hosted by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City</span>. This year’s topic, “Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy,” is particularly timely. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span> is struggling to decide whether inflation is strong enough to start raising interest rates, and the next meeting of its policy-making committee is coming up in mid-September. —Binyamin Appelbaum</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mylan Considers <span class="companylink">Perrigo</span> Bid</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shareholders in Mylan, a big maker of generic drugs, are scheduled to vote on Friday on a matter related to the company’s $36 billion hostile takeover bid for another pharmaceutical company, <span class="companylink">Perrigo</span>. The vote — on whether Mylan can issue new stock for the offer — will be a pivotal step in moving forward with that bid.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government data, due on Friday, is expected to show Japan’s core consumer prices fell 0.2 percent in July from a year ago. Japan’s core consumer price index rose 0.1 percent in June. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been trying to pull the economy out of nearly two decades of deflation through a stimulus program known as Abenomics. Although the program has increased profits at big corporations, it has also left many ordinary Japanese saying they feel few benefits. Japan’s economy has struggled to grow consistently. Last week, Japan announced its gross domestic product fell at an annualized rate of 1.6 percent in the three months through June, weighed down by dwindling exports and weaker consumer spending. Despite the recent economic contraction, analysts have expressed optimism that consumption will pick up and Japan will eventually return to growth in the current quarter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes grew in July to the fastest rate since 2007, and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region picked up this month -- fresh signs of steady economic growth that is likely to keep the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> on track to raise interest rates this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While other data on Thursday showed a slight increase in the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits last week, the trend remained consistent with strong momentum in the labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We continue to expect both economic growth and labor market activity to continue shifting higher, providing the justification for the Fed to begin the normalization in monetary policy in September,'' said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said existing-home sales increased 2 percent to an annual rate of 5.59 million units last month, the highest pace since February 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strengthening labor market is aiding demand for housing. But supply remains tight, pushing up home prices and sidelining first-time buyers, who are a crucial part of a strong housing market. The share of first-time buyers fell to a six-month low of 28 percent last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 2.24 million unsold previously owned homes on the market in July, down 4.7 percent from a year ago. That pushed the median home price to $234,000, up 5.6 percent from the year-ago period. Although higher prices could curb sales, they are raising equity for many owners and lifting household wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also may encourage builders to ramp up construction, further bolstering the economy. Housing starts rose to near an eight-year high in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market needs more new homes to be built to continue the momentum, so the trade-up buyers can find their next home and provide inventory for those looking to enter the home-buying market,'' said Bill Banfield, a vice president at Quicken Loans in Detroit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business activity index increased to 8.3 this month from a reading of 5.7 in July. A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. While demand for manufactured goods remained weak, shipments rebounded strongly and employment in the region's factories improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National manufacturing activity has been stymied by a strong dollar, weak global demand and the effect of lower oil prices on the energy sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Thursday, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said its Leading Economic Index declined 0.2 percent in July, after solid advances of 0.6 percent in both June and May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Despite a sharp drop in housing permits, the U.S. L.E.I. is still pointing to moderate economic growth through the remainder of the year,'' said Ataman Ozyildirim, director of business cycles and growth research at the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data added to solid June employment, retail sales and industrial production reports that have suggested the economy got off to a strong start in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a fourth report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 277,000 for the week ended Aug. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 5,500, to 271,500, last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the 21st straight week that the four-week average remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The claims data covered the week that the government surveyed employers for the nonfarm payrolls portion of August's employment report. The four-week average of claims fell 7,000 between the July and August survey periods, suggesting another month of healthy job gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These data show that companies are, for the most part, holding onto labor and reluctant to lay off workers,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ''The data are for the August payroll survey week and suggest that the trend of solid job creation remains intact.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Payrolls increased by 215,000 in July.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home builders started on single-family houses in July at the fastest pace since the recession began in late 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 0.2 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million homes, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Construction of single-family houses accounted for all of the gains, shooting up 12.8 percent last month to the highest rate since December 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase pointed to a housing market that has strengthened for much of the year, reflecting an increased sense of financial security for many Americans because of steady job growth, modest layoffs and relatively low mortgage rates. Continued gains in housing would help extend the current economic expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More housing starts means more construction jobs as well as confidence from real estate developers that people will be buying,'' said Tara Sinclair, a <span class="companylink">George Washington University</span> professor and chief economist for job site Indeed. ''We'll know the economy is really hitting stride when we see these starts in the range of 1.5 million.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total housing starts have risen 11.3 percent year-to-date. The market is attracting both buyers and renters; starts for apartment buildings have climbed 12.2 percent this year despite last month's drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improved housing market has already benefited sales at supply stores such as <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, the home improvement retailer. The company reported on Tuesday that sales at United States stores open at least one year had climbed 5.7 percent in the second quarter, pushing its stock to a record high of $123 in morning trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Tuesday's report also showed the potential limits of further gains from new construction as the number of building permits fell, a possible sign that demand will need to continue improving to further the pace of homebuilding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approved building permits decreased 16.3 percent in July to an annual rate of 1.12 million, after hitting an eight-year high in June. The decrease most likely reflects some pullback after months of gains and was caused primarily by a sharp plunge in permits to construct apartment complexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers and renters have crowded into the housing market this year, pushing up prices to levels that have worsened affordability. Builders have relieved some of this financial pressure by ramping up construction, yet the increases in housing starts and building permits still lags the surging demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new homes are 21.2 percent higher through the first six months of this year than the same period in 2014. Used homes are selling at an annual rate of 5.49 million, the fastest pace since February 2007, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index, which was released on Monday, reached 61 this month, up from 60 in July. Any reading above 50 signals expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, only 5.4 months' supply of new homes is available, compared with six months in a healthy market. Construction of single-family houses has risen at roughly half the pace of sales growth for new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the rental sector, prices are increasing at double the rate of hourly wage growth, largely because fewer vacant apartments are available. Home rental prices are up 4.3 percent in the last year, according to the real estate firm Zillow. Average hourly earnings have improved a mere 2.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are addressing the recent shift to rentals as more baby boomers start to downsize and millennials rent longer before buying their first homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate firm <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found that permitting activity for apartment complexes had surged well above the historical average in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the New York metro area, building permits for multifamily complexes is an astounding 423 percent higher than the 24-year average. The increase is 295 percent in Boston, 138 percent in Philadelphia, 161 percent in Los Angeles, 102 percent in San Francisco and 114 percent in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased demand primarily reflects an economy operating from a stronger foundation of hiring as the recovery enters its seventh year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers added 215,000 jobs in July, while the unemployment rate held at 5.3 percent for the second straight month. The economy has benefited from nearly three million new jobs in the last year, an influx of paychecks that has bolstered the housing and construction sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates have also helped sales. The average 30-year, fixed mortgage rate was 3.94 percent last week, according to the mortgage firm <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That is roughly two percentage points below the historical average.</p>
