<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — SEVEN years after the housing bubble burst, federal regulators backed away[http://online.wsj.com/articles/three-u-s-agencies-approve-relaxed-mortgage-lending-rules-1413905514] this month from the tougher mortgage-underwriting standards that the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 had directed them to develop. New standards were supposed to raise the quality of the “prime” mortgages that get packaged and sold to investors; instead, they will have the opposite effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Responding to the law, federal regulators proposed tough new standards in 2011, but after bipartisan outcries from <span class="companylink">Congress</span> and fierce lobbying by interested parties, including community activists, the Obama administration and the real estate and banking industries — all eager to increase home sales — the standards have been watered down. The regulators had wanted a down payment of 20 percent, a good credit record and a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 36 percent. But under pressure, they dropped the down payment and good-credit requirements and agreed to a debt-to-income limit as high as 43 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regulators believe that lower underwriting standards promote homeownership and make mortgages and homes more affordable. The facts, however, show that the opposite is true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late ’80s and early ’90s, down payments were 10 to 20 percent. The homeownership rate was 64 percent — about where it is now — and nearly 90 percent of housing markets were considered affordable (that is, home prices were no more than three times family income). By 2011 only 50 percent were considered affordable, and by 2014, just 36 percent — even though down payments as low as 5 percent are now common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How could this be? Consider this: If the required down payment for a mortgage is 10 percent, a potential home buyer with $10,000 can purchase a $100,000 home. But if the down payment is dropped to 5 percent, the same buyer can purchase a $200,000 home. The buyer is taking more risk by borrowing more, but can afford to bid more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, low underwriting standards — especially low down payments — drive housing prices up, making them less affordable for low- and moderate-income buyers, while also inducing would-be homeowners to take more risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s why homes were more affordable before the 1990s than they are today. Back then, when traditional standards for “prime” mortgages prevailed, homes were smaller; they had fewer bathrooms, and the kitchens were not appointed by Martha Stewart. A family could buy and live in a “starter home” for several years before selling it and using the accumulated equity to buy a bigger or better appointed home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a competitive housing market not subsidized by lax standards, home builders would similarly adjust by reducing the size and amenities of new homes to meet the financial resources of home buyers entering the market. Home prices would stabilize and not rise faster than incomes. Low- and moderate-income families and millennials might have to wait to save for a first home, but they would be able to afford it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Higher down payments are not the only way to limit excessive borrowing. The “standard” 30-year mortgage is a subsidized, archaic result of our government’s distorted housing policies; very few home buyers stay in a home for 30 years. A 15-year fixed-rate mortgage means higher monthly payments, but the homeowner starts to accumulate equity sooner, reducing the lender’s risk.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the government got out of the way, would sound underwriting standards come back? History suggests yes. Although <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> were government-backed, they were shareholder-owned, profit-making firms. They adopted strong underwriting standards to avoid the credit risk of subprime and other high-risk mortgages. But after <span class="companylink">Congress</span> enacted affordable-housing goals, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, in 1992, underwriting standards declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans generally favor eliminating the government’s role in housing finance, while Democrats worry that without government support, mortgages would be too expensive for low- and moderate-income families. Although it runs counter to the current Washington view, good underwriting standards can satisfy the objectives of both parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s clear that today’s policies create winners and losers. The winners include real estate agents and home builders, who want to increase borrowing and sell ever-larger and more expensive homes. The losers, as we saw in the financial crisis, are borrowers of modest means who are lured into financing arrangements they can’t afford. When the result is foreclosure and eviction, one of the central goals of homeownership — building equity — is undone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the financial crisis, Representative Barney Frank — the Massachusetts Democrat who led the <span class="companylink">House Financial Services Committee</span> during the crisis, and a champion of credit programs for low-income buyers — admitted, “It was a great mistake to push lower-income people into housing they couldn’t afford and couldn’t really handle once they had it.” Policy makers who support homeownership would be wise to consider who is hurt and who is helped when we abandon traditional underwriting standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter J. Wallison, a senior fellow at the <span class="companylink">American Enterprise Institute</span>, is the author of the forthcoming book “Hidden in Plain Sight: What Really Caused the World’s Worst Financial Crisis and Why It Could Happen Again.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans signing contracts to buy homes increased only slightly in September, as it remained difficult for some potential buyers to qualify for mortgage financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Monday that its seasonally adjusted index of pending home sales rose 0.3 percent over the last month, to 105. The index remains half a percentage point below its 2013 average but 1 percent higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight credit and price increases have limited buying activity. About 15 percent of the real estate agents surveyed for the index said they could not close a deal because the buyer was unable to obtain a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We continue to see steady, albeit modest, improvement in this sector,'' said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at <span class="companylink">BMO</span> Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales are a barometer of future purchases. A one- to two-month lag usually exists between a contract and a completed sale. The number of contract signings increased in the Northeast and South last month, while declining in the West and Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal regulators approved plans last week to expand the availability of credit. Five agencies -- including the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> and the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> -- backed changes to the rules on how much risk banks can accept when they package and sell mortgage securities in their multitrillion-dollar market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modified rules should enable buyers to put down less money to acquire a home. Regulators ended a requirement that borrowers make a 20 percent down payment if the lending bank did not hold at least 5 percent of the mortgage securities tied on its books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average mortgage rates have fallen for the last five weeks. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage tumbled last week to 3.92 percent, its lowest point since the week of June 6, 2013, according to the government-supported mortgage finance company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a typical year, real estate brokers in the United States sell more than $1 trillion worth of homes, making a total average commission of 5.4 percent on each sale. What many home buyers may not realize is that real estate commissions are negotiable and are far lower in some other countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Britain, for example, average real estate commissions came in at 1.8 percent of the selling price in 2011, according to Which?, a British consumer website, and on high-end properties the commission could have been as low as 0.75 percent. That's much lower than the average in the United States in the same year, as reported by the research firm Real Trends. So at average rates on the sale of a $500,000 house, an American homeowner would pay $18,000 more in commissions than a homeowner in Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why would this be? In the United States, buyers typically use their own broker, while they don't in Britain. ''In the U.K. and almost everywhere in the world, other than Canada and the U.S., the general practice is that one agent, hired by the seller, facilitates the transaction for both the buyer and the seller,'' said Simon Ru, founder and chief executive of LessThan6Percent, an online real estate site that tries to match sellers with brokers. ''Under the standard U.S. contract, buyers don't pay for their agent. The seller pays, so there is no visible incentive for buyers not to hire an agent, and costs double,'' Mr. Ru said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers may be able to save on fees by not using a broker at all, although they may have to do more legwork. Buyers can also ask selling brokers to cut their fees -- something they should be willing to do if they don't have to split the commission with another broker. Buyers should remember that, like lunch, there is no such thing as a free broker.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of new homes in the United States were nearly flat in September, after the government sharply revised downward what initially appeared to be an August surge in buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales edged up 0.2 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 467,000, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. The report also revised down the August sales rate to 466,000, from 504,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of sales for newly built homes has improved a mere 1.7 percent so far this year compared with 2013. Only the South has experienced gains in buying year-to-date; purchases have fallen in the Northeast, Midwest and West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has struggled to fully rebound since the recession ended more than five years ago. Many potential buyers lack the savings and strong credit history needed to afford a home, causing them to rent or remain in their existing houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction and buyers of new homes have trickled back from the worst of the crisis, but new-home sales remain far below the annual rate of 700,000 during the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in the most expensive Western states declined in September, reversing some of the gains made in August. Because homes are pricier in the West, that pushed down the median price for a new home to $259,000, from $286,800 in the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts noted that the new-home sales report from the government is notoriously volatile from month to month, yet sales have basically been stuck in place for the last few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is little evidence that the new single-family housing market is decisively breaking out of its medium-term flat pattern,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at the forecasting firm MFR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though some of the financial pressures on home buyers are starting to ease, that is unlikely to do much to suddenly increase sales of new homes in the final months of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last two weeks, federal regulators have unveiled plans to loosen down-payment requirements, and mortgage rates have tumbled below 4 percent. Along with a slowdown in price growth, these factors could eventually help usher more buyers into the real estate market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initial good news for home-equity wealth building -- particularly for those who have managed to hold onto their homes -- is that in most of the country prices have generally recovered since the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But building home equity will largely depend on where you live, when you bought your home and if you tap that equity for retirement income. The wide regional differences in home appreciation are worth noting for those still trying to use real estate to increase their nest egg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners who have been in their homes the longest will probably see the greatest increase in home equity. According to the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association, a trade association, homeowners 62 years and older ''now have more equity in their homes than at any time since early 2008. Home equity held by persons 62 and older has grown by more than 22 percent since the second quarter 2012, to a total of $3.73 trillion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This means that if you're an older, longtime homeowner outside the Sun Belt, you've probably regained the equity you lost during the housing bust of 2007-9. You may be able to tap that equity for retirement or other purposes through a loan, refinancing or downsizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet is home equity a reliable piggy bank?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home equity creation used to be seen as a forced savings plan. Whatever you invested in mortgage principal appreciated roughly at the rate of inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing credit crisis changed that perception for several generations of Americans. The bust devastated home prices in some of the most desirable Sun Belt areas -- Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declines ranged from as severe as 69 percent in the Daytona Beach, Fla., area to less than 5 percent in the largest Texas cities, according to Homes.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tide may have turned, though. Demographic changes in society -- especially baby boomers downsizing or moving to warmer places -- mean some coastal areas may once again prove to be good locations for building home equity, especially if building is restricted or climate change policies make development more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the most robust growth projections for housing appreciation are for the coasts. According to the Local Market Monitor, which tracks housing prices in more than 300 markets in the United States, California had the best performance over the last 20 years and is projected to grow a cumulative 30 percent over the next three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite high taxes and the state's well-publicized budget and water woes, demand is still strong for the Bay Area and parts of Southern California. Technology start-ups and mature businesses want to be around Silicon Valley and <span class="companylink">Stanford University</span>. And the Los Angeles area is a cultural and business mecca.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, the Local Market Monitor forecasts that prices are expected to rise 20 percent over the next three years in Florida, which in some areas suffered the most severe declines in the crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another standout is Texas, which is attracting new residents from the Midwest and Northeast and is forecast to grow by 20 to 30 percent in most areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides California, Florida and Texas, the Local Market Monitor anticipates robust gains in Colorado and the Pacific Northwest, said Ingo Winzer, president of the service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key to home equity growth is a combination of strong local economies, building and jobs. People have to find an area desirable and want to move there from other places -- the kind of mobility that virtually came to a standstill during the recession years. And as land for development becomes scarcer and demand grows for new retirement housing, home prices will benefit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those markets with the best expected home price appreciation have strong economies that attract in-migration,'' said Mr. Winzer. ''It's population growth from migration that has the strongest effect on home prices, especially now. On the other hand, people are moving out of the Midwest, moving to Texas or the West and Northwest, and are leaving behind an excess of housing with depressed prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other regions will not be as fortunate as retirees move to warmer locations with lower living costs. The Local Market Monitor projects mediocre to flat returns for Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and upstate New York. In the past, the worst performers in its survey have been in Ohio: Akron, Cleveland, Dayton and Toledo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because housing prices have proved to be volatile -- and may not return what they did in the past -- you may be better off concentrating on financial assets. As the financial crisis demonstrated, home appreciation is far from guaranteed. Areas can be overbuilt, and speculators can drive up prices with cheap financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Are you better off in financial assets than housing assets?'' asks Gary Painter, director of research at the Lusk Center for Real Estate at the <span class="companylink">University of Southern California</span>. ''Homes shouldn't be thought of as a way to save for retirement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While reverse mortgages can be complex and expensive -- they leverage equity for current cash needs -- homeowners can also get access to home equity through a ''cash out'' sale, selling their home and buying or renting a less expensive dwelling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Brennan Hall, president of Brennan Wealth Advisors in Addison, Tex., said, ''For the most part, building home equity is a smart financial step for the overall net worth picture of individuals, yet it should not be a primary driver as a source for retirement income.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most retirees, being debt-free can be a better financial strategy than using home equity for income or expenses. Having a mortgage in retirement reduces your monthly income, which is a growing problem. Nearly a third of those 65 and older had a mortgage in 2011. That's up from 22 percent in 2001, according to the <span class="companylink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Building equity in a home is another way of approaching a debt-free status for retirement, which should be the primary goal when it comes to homeownership,'' Ms. Brennan Hall said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes climbed to a one-year high in September, the latest indication the housing market recovery is gradually getting back on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said existing-home sales increased 2.4 percent to an annual rate of 5.17 million units, the strongest reading since September of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was above economists' expectations for a rise to a 5.1 million unit pace and more than reversed August's decline, which pushed down the annual rate of sales to 5.05 million units. Still, sales were 1.7 percent below those for September of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing recovery continues to move along sluggishly, as consumers are stuck between tight credit standards and limited wage growth,'' said Sophia Kearney-Lederman, an economist at FTN Financial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing activity stalled in the second half of 2013 after a run-up in mortgage rates. While it continues to be hobbled by sluggish wage growth, a recent decline in mortgage rates should help support sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 30-year mortgage rate fell to an average of 3.97 percent last week from 4.12 percent in the week ended Oct. 9, according to data from the mortgage-finance giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. The decline reflected a sharp drop in <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> debt yields as traders pushed back their expected timing of the first interest rate increase by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> against a backdrop of troubling economic news from overseas and a sell-off in global stock markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home sales picked up last month, first-time buyers, critical for a sustainable recovery, remained on the sidelines. They accounted for 29 percent of sales for a third straight month, below the 40 to 45 percent that is considered ideal by economists and real estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need to see more first-time buyers both willing and able to buy, without the support of excessively easy credit, if we really want to see a healthier and more sustained recovery in housing,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Mesirow Financial</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors, who had supported the market, have been withdrawing. They accounted for only 14 percent of transactions last month, down from 19 percent in September of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of unsold homes on the market increased 6 percent from a year earlier, to 2.30 million. At September's sales pace, it would take 5.3 months to clear houses from the market, down from 5.5 months in August. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With supply improving, house price gains continue to be moderate. The median home price nationwide rose 5.6 percent in September from a year earlier, to $209,700, but that increase was down from the double-digit growth seen for much of 2013.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RISING home values around the country are welcome news six years after the housing market collapsed. But there is a growing segment of buyers who are capable of spending so much money that they operate in rarefied space, paying prices that are rising into the tens of millions of dollars and have no bearing, really, on the usual rules of supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is especially true in some New York neighborhoods like the one along 57th Street in Manhattan, known as Billionaires' Row. There, apartments with Central Park views have fetched in excess of $30 million. What you get is nice: three bedrooms, four baths, floor-to-ceiling views. But the price is so detached from anything comparable, save what someone else has paid for a similarly opulent pad next door, that the phenomenon raises some intriguing questions:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter how much money you have, how would you know if you were getting a good deal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And beyond price, what is it like to buy one of these baubles of the 0.1 percent? How different is the experience from what everyone else in the world goes through to buy a home? Are there moments when egos flared and deals got ditched? Or are the buyers so wealthy that the gargantuan sums -- and even the whole experience -- are meaningless?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prevailing view is that most of the buyers are international. Many at the highest end are from South America, China and Eastern Europe, said Leonel Piraino, a broker at Douglas Elliman Real Estate. In Manhattan, their purchases are generally confined to condominiums, which are about 30 percent of the market and have laxer requirements for disclosing financial information and renting than the larger co-op market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of where the buyers come from, Mr. Piraino said most superrich international and American buyers looking at New York real estate as an investment were aiming in the $2 million to $4 million range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International buyers ''see the U.S. as a safe place to come to invest their money even if the return is not the highest return,'' he said. ''They look at it as a bank account: You come here, you park your money in real estate and you assure yourself that you're in a safe place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, he said, look at New York real estate as a long-term growth investment, where they can use the monthly rent to cover their carrying costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael, a 45-year-old London-based digital media entrepreneur who asked that his last name be withheld for privacy, has done just that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He bought the fourth-floor apartment at 50 Bond Street in New York's NoHo area for $5.65 million at the end of 2012 and the third floor a few months later for $5.3 million. He rents them for $21,000 and $20,000 a month, and owns them through a limited partnership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To be honest it was an investment decision for me,'' he said, adding that he's never lived in New York nor even spent a night in one of his condos. ''London is one of those markets where property right now doesn't offer a lot of value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he based his decision on considering the similarities of the two cities as global financial centers and then calculated that property values per square foot would have to rise 60 percent in New York to reach where they are in prime London neighborhoods like Chelsea. He could also charge enough rent in New York to cover all of his costs, including 30-year mortgages on both properties at interest rates under 4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm better off borrowing at 3 to 4 percent and buying two condos,'' he said. ''I do think we're going to look back in 10 years' time and say gosh that was the most amazing opportunity of our lifetime.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was persuaded to buy the second property by his agent, Mr. Piraino, who pointed out that owning two 3,000-square-foot condos on Bond Street that someone else could combine was more valuable than similar apartments apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet for foreign buyers owning real estate in New York -- or anywhere in the United States -- their heirs can end up with a hefty estate tax bill they might not be prepared for. The exemption for nonresident aliens is only $60,000, with a 40 percent tax on real property over that. (The exception is if the United States has an estate tax treaty with the person's home country.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depending on the level of wealth, buyers can set up expensive and complicated structures to own the property or they can buy life insurance to cover the estate tax. But getting that insurance is not cheap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bryan Schick, president of NFP BVI Ltd., an international insurance brokerage firm, said the premiums varied widely depending on the risk rating of the country where the person resides. For an A-rated country, like Britain, the annual premium for $10 million of life insurance would be about $75,000 a year. But for a C-rated country like Colombia, that premium jumps to more than $122,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When international owners are ready to sell or buy, that transaction typically takes longer and requires more patience on the other side. Jason Walker, another broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, just brokered the sale of a $7 million downtown loft that was owned by a Middle Eastern princess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It definitely added a layer of complexity to everything,'' Mr. Walker said. ''I had to be careful to manage the expectations of the purchaser. The offer came in during Ramadan so I stopped getting responses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''You had American buyers, a Middle Eastern seller and European lawyers -- there were cultural sensitivities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a segment of the market, the globe-spanning superrich, that real estate firms are chasing the way other luxury brands are. To that end, <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> and Knight Frank Residential, a similar high-end, London-based brokerage firm, recently announced an alliance to serve and share clients buying property around the world -- and to keep them from going to different brokerage firms in different markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New Yorker by birth, Marc Rappaport has a different view of the city's booming luxury real estate market: It's a more interesting investment than stocks and bonds. He bought three apartments in Lower Manhattan in 2012 and 2013 that ranged in price from between $1 million and $2 million to more than $3 million. He is now looking to buy a pied-à-terre in Paris, even though he doesn't speak French. (He does have a girlfriend there.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I look at it more as a lifestyle,'' said Mr. Rappaport, whose wealth comes from distributing mutual funds. ''I could make more money in stock and bond investments. The investment performance is not the driver.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With mortgages on two of the three New York properties, he said he was also spurred by low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet at the highest end, a mortgage typically has to come after an all-cash purchase. Competition can be fierce, and that increases the pressure to pay cash for these properties or make other arrangements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Welsh, head of private banking at PNC, said consumer financial protection regulations that came into effect this year make the mortgage process much longer and more complicated, even for people with plenty of money. To get access to money more quickly, he said clients prefer to use other assets as collateral -- in effect, a high-end margin loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in this rarefied world, now is a moment when people believe strongly in luxury real estate. Some international clients are buying it for children attending college in New York, while others, like real estate investors before them, see it as an asset that will just go up in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know what my exact plan is,'' said Michael, the London buyer. ''I have fixed mortgages. I expect to hold them for 10 to 15 years. By that time, the rents will go up and my monthly mortgage bill won't.'' Or at least that's the hope.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arun Kumar owns three apartments in New Delhi, where he has carved out a comfortable life as part of India’s rapidly expanding middle class. Not long ago, he also became a global landlord, picking up an inexpensive three-bedroom house and a duplex nearly 8,000 miles away, in St. Louis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Kumar and other affluent Indians, American real estate is a security blanket. Faced with what some have considered a bubble in real estate prices in major Indian cities and a sometimes jittery <span class="companylink">Bombay Stock Exchange</span>, they are joining a wave of buyers from other countries who see the recovering United States housing market as one of the best places to put their money these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wealthy elite from China, Latin America and elsewhere have bought pieds-à-terre in glassy towers in Manhattan, luxury condos in Miami and homes along the West Coast. Law enforcement investigations have found that some foreign investors are using American real estate holdings, at least in part, to hide cash and other assets from the authorities in their home countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many less-than-superrich foreign investors just want a safe place to put extra savings, and their investments tend to be much less grandiose than the trophy properties that have drawn most of the attention. And for Indians in particular, who long trusted in gold to protect their wealth, American real estate offers a ‘‘very, very attractive destination,’’ said Subir Gokarn, the director of research at Brookings India in New Delhi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jed Kolko, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, an online marketplace for residential real estate, said the most popular property searches for people from India were in and around Silicon Valley, where technology firms heavily recruit from India; in the Boston and Philadelphia areas near universities that have numerous students from India; and in suburban areas of New Jersey and in the New York City borough of Queens, where there are established Indian-American communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an echo of the late 1980s, foreign investment in United States real estate has taken off again. A survey from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> estimates that from April 2013 to March of this year, total sales to international clients were about $92.2 billion, a 35 percent increase over the previous 12 months. The figure includes purchases by recent immigrants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers now make up 7 percent of total existing-home sales of $1.2 trillion, according to the survey. Of those, Indians represent 6 percent of the purchases, spending $5.8 billion, up from $3.9 billion over the same period a year earlier and on par with buyers from Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians have long bought American property and still do so in big numbers, with purchases centered for the most part in Arizona, Florida and more recently in Las Vegas. Canada still accounts for the largest share of buyers, but China is the fastest-growing source of clients, according to the real estate agents’ group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Chinese buyers are bigger spenders. Their real estate purchases in the United States nearly doubled from April 2013 to last March, increasing to $22 billion from the previous period. They accounted for nearly a quarter of all international sales in the current period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Most people who can come here, they are pretty wealthy,’’ said Grace Tian, a broker with Realty Mark Associates in Philadelphia who often works with Chinese clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, buyers from India are a more eclectic group. These include parents living in India who buy apartments for students attending college, making sure the units have concierge service and an extra bedroom so they can visit for extended periods, several real estate agents said. After the students leave college, the parents often keep the apartment and rent it out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘It’s a good investment in their eyes and it can be a better deal instead of them paying dorm costs or renting somewhere else,’’ said Michael DiMella, a managing partner with the <span class="companylink">Charlesgate Realty Group</span> in Boston whose Indian clients have bought near <span class="companylink">Northeastern University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the riverfront Newport area of Jersey City has emerged as popular with Indian buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent evening, commuters returning home from Manhattan wove between the high-rises, passing advertisements for Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa, an Indian reality dance TV show, and Raaz Specialty Indian Cuisine. A poster in the nearby train station for an Indian news website featured a riff about pani puri, a popular Indian street snack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cluster of mothers who had recently arrived from India gathered outside a playground with their toddlers. For now, they were renting apartments with their husbands, but said they hoped to buy condos in the area soon, citing conveniences for young mothers like a grocery store within walking distance, gym and parks, and a fast commute to the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Irene Barnaby, a broker with <span class="companylink">Weichert Realtors</span> in Jersey City, said her Indian clients generally spent about $600,000 to $800,000 on condos. Some buyers pay cash because traditional banks won’t give them mortgages without a credit history in the United States. But she has also created relationships with smaller banks that will lend money to her clientele.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘They can get exactly what they want in this area,’’ Ms. Barnaby said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Padmanabhan Palani, president of the condo association board at the 443-unit James Monroe tower in Jersey City, said the area was comfortable for many people just arriving from India or elsewhere in Asia, because it resembles the high-rise districts of Mumbai, India, and Hong Kong. What’s more, he said, his building was close to the train station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘In a snowstorm, 100 meters is very important in how far you walk,’’ said Mr. Palani, who came to the United States 12 years ago on a work visa for a technology job and is now a permanent resident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some United States real estate brokers are capitalizing on the growing interest from Indians. Myron Von Raesfeld, a real estate agent in the heart of Silicon Valley, said his firm started working with technology companies in 1999 to offer seminars teaching immigrants with H-1B work visas the intricacies of the American real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He now offers the seminar at 80 companies, in part to keep ahead of the competition. ‘‘Realtors are becoming very astute at this foreign wave,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indian real estate agents are also getting in on the action. Vikram Somani, owner of Property Hunters in Mumbai, has turned to the American market, noting that title insurance is available and the buying process is far more organized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rohit Prakash, the president of American Full House in Austin, Tex., is recruiting brokers like Mr. Somani to round up Indian clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His firm, created four years ago, arranges limited liability partnerships helping his clients overcome tax issues and red tape that otherwise would apply to foreign investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘There’s a sexiness to say ‘I own property in the U.S.,’ a little bit of bragging rights,’’ Mr. Prakash said. ‘‘But for them to know how to go about how to do this, they were clueless.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his clients is Mr. Kumar, who bought his St. Louis properties sight unseen, spending about $100,000 for a three-bedroom single-family home and a two-unit house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far the investment hasn’t been as good as Mr. Kumar had hoped. One of the units sat empty for longer than expected, and a roof had a problem that needed to be fixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I’m hopeful this year it will be better,’’ said Mr. Kumar, who is considering buying property in Silicon Valley in the future. ‘‘In any case, I was looking at investment in the U.S.A. for the long term.’’</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence fell in September for the first time in five months, and home prices in July rose less than expected from a year earlier, underscoring the unsteady nature of United States growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report on Tuesday showed that business activity growth in the Midwest slowed slightly in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're continuing to effectively struggle,'' said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics. ''Some of the optimism that we got in the updraft in consumer confidence in the third quarter was probably a bit overstated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>, an industry group, said its index of consumer confidence fell to 86.0 in September from an upwardly revised 93.4 the month before. Economists had expected a reading of 92.5, according to a Reuters poll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence was hurt by concerns over the job market and expectations that economic growth will slow in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas gained 6.7 percent in July, year over year, shy of expectations for a 7.5 percent rise. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, prices in the 20 cities fell 0.5 percent in July. A Reuters survey of economists had forecast a flat reading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The home price data suggests that we haven't entirely repaired the home sales process,'' Mr. Englund said. ''We have a housing market where people who are dependent on credit to buy homes are finding that homes aren't as easy to buy as they used to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a third report, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago's business barometer fell to 60.5 this month from 64.3 in August, falling short of economists' expectations for 61.9. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the regional economy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have remained relatively low this year, and little changed, despite previous predictions of an inevitable rise. Borrowers, though, may be wondering how much longer this environment can last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point, waiting for the rise in interest rates ''is a little bit like 'Waiting for Godot,' '' said Stan Humphries, the chief economist for Zillow, an online real estate information service, referring jokingly to the Samuel Beckett play named for a character who never shows up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Humphries and other economists are now predicting that the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage will hit 5 percent by the middle of next year, partly as a result of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s planned withdrawal from buying mortgage-backed securities. Last week, the 30-year national average was 4.28 percent, according to HSH.com, a publisher of loan information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While 5 percent is still low by historical standards, an increase of that size can reduce buying power more than borrowers may think. According to Zillow, a 1 percent rise in interest rates could raise monthly mortgage payments on a typical home next year by more than $700 in pricier parts of the country. Zillow compared the effect of a rate increase to 5.1 percent from 4.1 percent for a 30-year mortgage in 35 metropolitan areas. Figuring in the expected increases in home values over the next year, Zillow found that monthly payments would rise by as little as $65 in the St. Louis area and as much as $710 in the San Jose/Silicon Valley region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the New York metropolitan area, which includes Northern New Jersey, Long Island and Westchester, monthly payments would rise by about $200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a rise in rates of even 50 basis points can have a substantial effect on demand, Mr. Humphries noted that for the country as a whole, homes are still relatively affordable. From 1985 to 2000, paying the principal and interest on a median-priced home ate up about 22 percent of median household income, he said. Now, people are spending about 15 percent of median income for the median-priced home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So even when rates go to 7 percent, it will still be affordable'' in most areas, Mr. Humphries said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles and the Bay Area are glaring exceptions, as home prices there are demanding 40 percent of household income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lack of inventory in mid- to lower-priced homes may pose more of a problem for first-time buyers. Research by Redfin, a national real estate brokerage, shows a sharp decline in home listings below $375,000 compared with 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at properties listed in July, Redfin found 28 percent fewer homes priced under $375,000 than in July 2011, and 50 percent fewer priced at $130,000 or less. Above $375,000, inventory was up by 16 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, the number of listings over all declined by an unseasonably high 9 percent compared with July, signaling that it is unlikely ''we are going to see a big push in affordable inventory anytime soon,'' said Nela Richardson, Redfin's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the plus side for buyers, the market could become less competitive. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported on Monday that purchases by investors and all-cash buyers fell sharply in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many markets are not going to see the same multiple-bid environment that we saw even earlier this year,'' Ms. Richardson said. ''It will be easier to win the home of your dreams than it was a few months ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers need not feel rushed, she said, noting that low rates are likely to stay low ''for a few more months. It's O.K. to be patient and to look.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDIn a sign of New York City's rapidly shifting real estate market, the Durst family, whose empire was built on a forest of Manhattan office towers, is plunging into the housing market with an ambitious plan for a sprawling residential development on the Queens waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dursts, whose two skyscrapers on 42nd Street helped fuel the renaissance of Times Square, are now looking to spend $1.5 billion to transform a knobby, windswept peninsula in Astoria, where the East River meets the Harlem River, across the water from Gracie Mansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dursts' move to Astoria highlights a trend in the city in which a seemingly insatiable demand for luxury housing has upended the traditional pecking order in the real estate world. Building glamorous office towers for Fortune 500 companies is not the surefire route to fame and riches it once was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the cost of land soaring and high-end apartments commanding soaring prices, developers whose reputation and wealth rests on gleaming office towers are leaping into the residential market in the hunt for profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brookfield, a longtime commercial developer whose holdings include the former World Financial Center in Lower Manhattan, is putting down $1 billion for nearly 4,000 apartments in northern Manhattan and on Roosevelt Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Queens, not far from the Durst project, <span class="companylink">Tishman Speyer Properties</span>, the owner of Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building, is planning to build a rental complex with 1,600 apartments. In Downtown Brooklyn, Tishman Speyer is bidding against <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty</span> and other developers for a former <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> property on Fulton and Hoyt Streets with an eye to turning it into a residential project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fisher real estate family, which is also known for its office towers, is turning toward the residential side with the development of a 950-foot-tall condominium tower in TriBeCa and a 37-story apartment building on the East Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the Dursts have built a few apartment buildings in recent years, the Queens project represents a major, long-term investment in the city's booming housing market and its first foray outside Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans call for a set of seven apartment buildings with more than 2,000 apartments -- 20 percent reserved for poor and working-class tenants -- an esplanade, a school and a supermarket where industrial buildings now stand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Times are changing,'' said Douglas Durst, a third-generation developer. ''Large-scale office development opportunities are sparse and Manhattan land is cost-prohibitive to build rentals. It is time for the family to go deeper into residential and to cross the ocean to Astoria.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changing economics of the real estate market have made housing more appealing. Land costs have doubled and tripled in recent years to $600 a square foot and more as residential developers snapped up one site after another. Commercial developers have often found themselves priced out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end apartments in Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn sell for $4,000 or more per square foot, far more than most commercial tenants are willing to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The economic dynamics make it good to be in multifamily,'' Richard B. Clark, chief executive of Brookfield Property Partners, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, even as they venture into residential real estate, many prominent developers are still investing in commercial deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Robert A. Knakal, a real estate broker who has sold a long list of development sites and buildings this year, said he no longer sends out property listings to select groups of commercial, retail, hotel or residential developers and investors. ''Today,'' he said, ''we send out our listings to a much wider audience of potential buyers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dursts, who own 4 Times Square and 10 other office towers in Manhattan, spent more than a year mulling whether to buy the residential development in what was for them far-off Astoria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Durst's father, Seymour, a prominent developer who died in 1995, used to brag that he could walk to any of his properties from the family's Midtown office. He built office towers in which his tenants went home at night; residential buildings were ''messy'' and complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the family ran out of land in Manhattan after it built the 55-story Bank of America Building at 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a year ago, Lincoln Equities Group contacted the Dursts, asking if they were interested in buying a residential development it owned in a working-class section of Queens. This week, the Dursts paid well over $100 million for a 90 percent stake in the project. Lincoln will retain about 10 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as Hallets Point, the site is next to Astoria Houses, a city housing project built in the 1950s that is home to more than 3,500 residents, and nearly a mile from the nearest subway stop. There are warehouses and a ball field. It is by no means a gentrifying neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Bergstein, a principal at Lincoln, spent seven years putting together a string of adjoining industrial properties there and working with residents and city officials on a proposal. Last year, the Bloomberg administration approved his plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Dursts got it right away,'' Mr. Bergstein said. ''This will be an iconic property that'll completely change this portion of the Queens waterfront.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hallets Point will eventually have 2,404 apartments, including 483 units for poor and working-class tenants in seven buildings. In an unusual arrangement with the <span class="companylink">New York City Housing Authority</span>, the developer will build and own two buildings on the grounds of Astoria Houses for affordable housing for older adults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will also be three market-rate buildings, ranging from 17 to 31 stories, and two buildings in which 20 percent of the units will be subsidized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complex will open up the waterfront to local residents with an esplanade and include a supermarket, retail space and a school. The city has promised better bus service, and there is talk of a ferry to Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plans won the support of elected officials, local residents and the community board. Claudia Coger, president of the Astoria Houses Resident Association, said the neighborhood had a ''deserted'' feel, because there were few stores and the industrial buildings were closed at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The mere fact that somebody would want to develop over there is a plus for the quality of life for the residents,'' Ms. Coger said of Hallets Point. ''We gave them our feelings about tall buildings blocking our beautiful Manhattan views and the need for a grocery store. They listened to what we had to say.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's Planning Commission is expected to vote by the end of the month on a second residential project nearby, Astoria Cove, which includes 1,723 apartments. Like Hallets Point, the developer has promised that 20 percent of the units would be for low- and moderate-income tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mayor Bill de Blasio has made affordable housing a high priority of his administration. He and the City Council are expected to push the portion of affordable housing closer to 30 percent before Astoria Cove receives final approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Record-breaking land values and market demand are causing historically Manhattan-based developers to rework their business models and consider new products and locations,'' said Ross Moskowitz, real estate partner at <span class="companylink">Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan</span>, a Manhattan law firm. ''Commercial developers are now following the money outside of the Manhattan core and considering residential projects, which never would have happened a few years ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: October 4, 2014, Saturday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Saturday about developers who usually focus on commercial projects, but who are now entering the New York City residential market in search of profits, misstated, in some editions, the number of apartments expected at Hallets Point, a development in Queens. It is 2,404, not 1,921.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN an economy is growing rapidly, and the population is increasing, house prices are likely to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conversely, areas with slow growth are not likely to see house prices increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is generally what has happened in the United States since the summer of 2007, when house prices peaked, as measured by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are exceptions. In the Pacific region, house prices soared during the boom. But they have performed relatively poorly in recent years even though the regional economy has outpaced the national one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the East North Central region -- Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, the bulk of the states in the so-called Rust Belt -- the economy has grown more slowly than in any of the other eight regions tabulated by the Census Bureau, and population growth has also lagged other regions. But home prices have performed better than might have been expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The anomalies appear to reflect excesses during the housing boom. In the seven years before home prices peaked in June 2007, they rose 60 percent for the entire country. But in the Pacific states -- Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington -- prices climbed 115 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps as a result, home prices in that region fell further than in any other region during the Great Recession, and now remain 14.1 percent lower than they were in June 2007, despite an economy that has done better than the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the housing finance agency reported this week, home prices nationally have recovered to the point that they are only 4.6 percent lower than the peak value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As can be seen in the accompanying charts, the East North Central states have matched that performance, and thus done better than many regions, despite having less economic growth than any other region since mid-2007. That may reflect the fact that house prices in that region rose just 26 percent during the seven years before the housing bubble burst, less than in any other region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House price indexes, it should be noted, can vary sharply. The housing finance agency index uses mortgages bought or insured by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the two government-sponsored enterprises that the agency regulates. That excludes the sales history of homes that require so-called jumbo mortgages, loans too large for Fannie and Freddie to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index did not rise as rapidly as some others did during the boom, but it continued to go up for nearly a year after a major competitor, the Case-Shiller 20-city composite, peaked. That index has not recovered as rapidly as the housing finance agency index since the recession ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the agency index, the best-performing region since 2007 has been the one called West South Central by the Census Bureau, comprising the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. Home prices there are now 14.6 percent higher than they were in the summer of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is also the section that has had the strongest economic growth during the period, in large part because it benefited from the boom in energy production. At the end of 2013 -- the latest regional data available -- the real gross domestic product of that group of states was 18.6 percent larger than it had been in mid-2007. That is more than twice the growth of the entire country during the period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mining industry, which includes oil and gas wells, accounts for about 10 percent of the economy in that region but produced 20 percent of the growth over the period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the West North Central area -- Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota -- home prices are 1.6 percent higher than they were in mid-2007. That area's G.D.P. is up 11.8 percent, in significant part because of a surge in shale gas production in part of the region, and its population has also been rising. North Dakota, the center of the oil boom, has experienced both a surging population as people move in and the fastest economic growth of any state.</p>
<p>GRAPHICS: House Prices Follow the Economy, Mostly: Since the housing bubble burst, home prices in the United States have generally recovered the most in areas  with the strongest economic growth. But prices have lagged growth in the Pacific states. And in the Upper  Midwest -- the Census Bureau's East North Central division -- the economy has grown slowly, but home  prices have done better than might have been expected.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of new single-family homes in the United States surged in August to their highest level in more than six years, a sign the housing recovery remains on course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery, however, will probably remain gradual against a backdrop of relatively high unemployment and sluggish wage growth, two factors that are seen as sidelining younger first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is welcome news in an otherwise mixed outlook,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Mesirow Financial</span>. ''We are still a long way from the housing market recovering from the bust.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales jumped 18 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 504,000 units, a second straight monthly gain, which took them to the highest level since May 2008, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though new-home sales account for only about 9 percent of the housing market, the increase helped allay fears of renewed weakness after a surprise decline in sales of existing homes last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect some of this buoyancy to be reversed in the coming month, but continue to believe that the underlying fundamentals of the housing sector remain favorable,'' said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Monday that sales of existing homes fell in August for the first time in four months as investors who had been supporting the market stepped away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said they hoped the departure of the investors would leave an opening for first-time buyers, but they expressed concern that still-high unemployment and tepid wage growth would continue to constrain sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of first-time buyers in the market for existing homes has been stuck around 29 percent, well below the 40 percent to 45 percent considered ideal by economists and by real estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's still a challenging environment for those buyers,'' said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS. ''You can make a good case for a slow, gradual improvement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for loans to buy homes fell last week as mortgage rates crept up. New loan applications are well off peaks seen early last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With average hourly earnings up only 2.1 percent over the past year, many Americans are choosing to rent, while some of those who have recently graduated from college are moving back home or staying with friends, factors that are weighing on home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to government data released last week, 492,000 households were formed last year, well below the one million that economists say would be consistent with a healthy market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Household formation, a major driver of new construction, is falling asleep at the wheel,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist at <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the rise in sales in August, the stock of new houses on the market hit its highest level in four years, giving buyers more choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At August's sales pace it would take 4.8 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.6 months in July. A six-month supply is normally considered a healthy balance between supply and demand.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FORT MONMOUTH, N.J. -- When the <span class="companylink">Pentagon</span> decided to close Fort Monmouth almost a decade ago, the community lamented the loss of more than 5,000 jobs and wondered what would happen to the sprawling Army base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 1,126 acres in parts of three boroughs, the base, at the northern end of the Jersey Shore, remained well positioned, relatively close to New York City -- an hour away by commuter train -- and to the Garden State Parkway, a highway that runs close to the base's western boundary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As real estate demand in central New Jersey grows more competitive, the site is generating increasing interest. The base's prospects for reuse are brightened by the recovering property market, especially for retail and residential space, in Monmouth County, an affluent area where developable land is at a premium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Authority, a state agency that manages the sale of the property, says it has been receiving more inquiries from national developers recently than in recent years, multiple proposals for every offer and competitive bids for parcels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The redevelopment has been propelled by the decision by CommVault, a data and information management software company, to move its global headquarters from nearby Oceanport to a new $100 million building on the base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's decision is a major step forward for the base's redevelopment, officials say, as well as for the authority's plan to establish a technology hub on the campus and for New Jersey's efforts to expand its technology industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With CommVault spending that kind of money here, it was a huge statement,'' Bruce Steadman, the authority's executive director, said in an interview. ''It put New Jersey on the map in large bold letters.'' The CommVault investment shows that a former military base can be successfully redeveloped quickly, Mr. Steadman said, easing concerns that such efforts may fall victim to bureaucratic delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is expected to begin moving 900 workers into the building next month, less than two years after closing on its purchase of a 55-acre lot for $5.9 million, Mr. Steadman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He attributed the speed of the move in part to the cooperation of the three boroughs that cover the base -- Eatontown, Tinton Falls and Oceanport -- in expediting permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerald M. Turning, mayor of Tinton Falls, welcomed the development as a source of tax revenue and said local schools had the capacity to accommodate extra children, making up for the students they lost when staffing was reduced at a nearby naval weapons station about six years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the borough's land area will expand, it will be able to tax the structures that are built there, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you're starting at zero and you are able to build on that land, everything you get is a plus,'' Mr. Turning said. ''This development is a godsend to the borough of Tinton Falls.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign of growing demand, the authority is in exclusive negotiations with the home builder <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> to construct a town center consisting of 241 residential units and 40,000 square feet of retail space on the western edge of the base, next to the municipal center of Tinton Falls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials are also in talks with RPM Development, a New Jersey-based developer of affordable housing, for the renovation of 117 units of officers' housing, and with Kiely Realty Group, also of New Jersey, for the conversion of the 40,000-square-foot Russel Hall, the former garrison headquarters and a research center for the Army Signal Corps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Demand is strong,'' said Les Smith, senior director at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the broker for the authority. ''We've had pretty good success with the properties.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Mr. Smith reported significant demand for a 70-acre parcel where 250,000 square feet of retail space and about 300 residential units were planned. ''We're continually talking to developers who have expressed strong interest in bidding on that property,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As every day goes by, the market is getting stronger in those areas,'' Mr. Smith said, referring to residential and retail space. ''If you come up with a good development site, they want it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some newer Army buildings are expected to be refitted for new uses, most, dating from the 1940s and 1950s, are set for demolition because they were purpose-built and cannot be economically converted. From a total of some five million square feet of space in about 500 buildings, around four million square feet are expected to be demolished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buildings, like a 1920s golf clubhouse that has been nominated for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, will be preserved, but the Myers Center, a 673,000-square-foot Cold War research center and the largest building on the base, is not expected to survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also scheduled for demolition is a formerly top-secret structure known as the Star Wars Building, where the Army conducted research into a missile-defense shield in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of demolition and construction is expected to be borne by the purchasers, who must participate in a public bidding process. ''There are no private sales or side deals,'' Mr. Steadman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to dispel any hopes that the disposal of military real estate might mean handouts for those with the right connections, Mr. Steadman stressed that land and buildings were being sold at market rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nobody gets anything for free,'' he said. ''When a military base closes, everybody holds their hands out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the authority, which is legally required to reinvest sale proceeds in redevelopment, may accept payments in kind for property that has valid social uses, Mr. Steadman added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cited a former school for children of Army personnel that could have been sold for some $2 million if it had been converted into offices. Instead, it was given to the Tinton Falls School District in return for street improvements and a new water line, both of which will be provided by the borough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steadman said the authority had an ''excellent'' relationship with the three boroughs but acknowledged that some in the community were still uneasy about the impact of the huge development project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While residents were angry and tried to fight the Defense Department's Base Realignment and Closure Commission's decision to close the base in 2005, many are now focused on how infrastructure like roads and schools will cope with the expected new community, Mr. Steadman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are still very worried about what's going to happen to their town,'' he said. ''If you are a resident of Tinton Falls, your borough is going to get an extra 255 acres of land. That's a concern when you are the business officer of a borough.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those concerns led to the communities negotiating a firm limit of 1,600 new residential units on the base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To ease local concerns, the authority aims to make sure that any new or renovated buildings become sources of tax revenue as soon as possible, Mr. Steadman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authority is adding more retail space and space expected to be occupied by technology companies to its master plan, as well as cutting back on planned office development in response to a glut in the local market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In some instances, we are looking at alternate uses for areas that were zoned for office under our master plan,'' said David E. Nuse, the authority's deputy executive director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nuse said the authority was planning to increase its retail area by as much as 100,000 square feet compared with the master plan, and to use some areas that were originally set for office development as part of the planned technology cluster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authority has also incorporated sustainability into its plan. Some 40 percent of the base will be preserved as open space, crossed by bike lanes and walking trails. The Army's heating and cooling systems will be reused where possible, and an electric-vehicle charging facility will replace a conventional gas station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan's environmental focus is a nod to anticipated young technology workers, who are demanding more walkable communities where they live and work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Millennials are less car-dependent,'' Mr. Nuse said. ''We don't want this to be some suburban real estate development.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, suggesting that a sharp slowdown in job growth last month was probably an aberration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While other data on Thursday showed that housing starts declined in August, upward revisions for groundbreaking in July offered hope that the housing market was continuing to improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have broad-based growth in the economy, including the housing market,'' said Gus Faucher, senior economist at <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 36,000 to a seasonally adjusted 280,000 for the week ended Sept. 13, the lowest level since July, the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to only 305,000 last week. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, slipped 4,750, to 299,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Faucher said the data was consistent with what the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> was expecting to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data came a day after the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> renewed a pledge to keep interest rates near zero for a ''considerable time,'' while hinting at a faster pace of rate increases than the central bank was signaling a few months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 14.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 956,000 units. July's starts were revised to show a 1.12-million unit rate, the highest level since November 2007, instead of the previously reported 1.09-million unit rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That helped take some of the sting out of the report, which also showed that permits fell 5.6 percent, to a 998,000-unit pace in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family starts in the South, where about half of the single-family construction takes place, increased last month to an eight-month high. Permits in the South hit their highest level since April 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is clawing back after a setback caused by a rise in mortgage rates last year. However, it remains constrained by a relatively high unemployment rate and stringent lending practices by financial institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the labor market gaining traction, though, economists expect housing activity to accelerate next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The underlying momentum in the housing sector remains quite favorable and we expect building activity to rebound next month,'' said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week's jobless claims data covered the period during which employers were surveyed for September's nonfarm payrolls. Claims fell 19,000 between the August and September survey periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop suggested that payroll growth rebounded from August's eight-month low, which most economists dismissed as a fluke, noting that payroll gains tended to be smaller in August because of problems adjusting the data for seasonal hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers added only 142,000 jobs to their payrolls in August, snapping six consecutive months of job increases above 200,000. The jobless claims report showed that the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 63,000, to 2.43 million, in the week to Sept. 6.</p>
<p>While housing starts declined in August, data showed that  groundbreaking in July was stronger than initially reported. (PHOTOGRAPH BY MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EUROPEAN PRESS AGENCY)   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes deemed unusual may be desirable for some to own, but even borrowers with excellent credit may have trouble obtaining sufficient financing to buy them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that unusual homes can be difficult to value, because appraisers rely on the sales of comparable properties to come up with a price. In the absence of strong ''comps,'' mortgage underwriters may not be satisfied that an appraised value is well supported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they are willing to extend any financing, lenders may ''carve down pretty significantly what they're willing to lend,'' said Tim Sickinger, a senior vice president of Atlantic Residential Mortgage in Westport, Conn. So buyers looking outside the box should be prepared to come up with more than the usual 20 percent down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes a property unusual is often specific to the location. A home may be unusual for the region. ''What's normal in Beverly Hills would be unusual in Brooklyn,'' said Peter C. Grabel, the managing director at Luxury Mortgage of Stamford, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home may simply be unusual for the neighborhood. One of the more common examples, Mr. Grabel said, is what is known as a ''white elephant'' -- a grand and spacious older home that is surrounded by far less expensive, newer properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, it is the use that is unusual for the location, such as a multifamily home in a single-family neighborhood. Jason Auerbach, a divisional manager for First Choice Loan Services, a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">First Choice Bank</span>, recalled a buyer who recently sought financing for two single-family homes on one lot in the Hamptons. First Choice financed the purchase, but at 65 percent loan-to-value, Mr. Auerbach said, meaning the buyer had to come up with a 35 percent down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property size can also pose a problem. Many lenders have a minimum-square-footage requirement, typically around 600 square feet, which leaves out many smaller city apartments, said Michael Vargas, the president of the Vanderbilt Appraisal Company in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders also have a cutoff for the maximum amount of acreage they will include in a home's value, he added. ''Over five acres and they may start to get concerned about whether they're dealing with farmland or not a typical residential property,'' Mr. Vargas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While an extensive wooded buffer may very well be an enhancement to value, the lender is focused more on the house as collateral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers of sustainable homes may also encounter difficulties. Most appraisers struggle with how to factor in the value of projected energy savings, said Sandra Adomatis, an appraiser in southwest Florida who specializes in ''green'' valuation. And finding comparable sales is difficult because only a small percentage of homes fall into this category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Adomatis noted that a new guideline in the draft stage for loans insured by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> may help because it gives lenders the go-ahead to accept methodologies other than comps for valuing green features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some typically hard-to-finance properties are becoming more attractive to smaller banks seeking to grow their market share. First Choice, for example, is providing financing for buyers at some condo hotels, where a percentage of the units are privately owned, Mr. Auerbach said. That includes purchases at the Trump SoHo, in Manhattan, where buyers can stay in their units for no more than 120 days each calendar year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While First Choice isn't loosening its standards for qualifying borrowers, ''we are comfortable with some nontraditional properties,'' Mr. Auerbach said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ethel Walker and her daughter Tasha pay $650 a month to rent a home in Ferguson, Mo., from an investment firm 1,800 miles away in Los Angeles. A few miles from the Walkers, Corey Bryant and his mother are renting a two-bedroom home in Ferguson from the same California firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasingly, the new landlord in Ferguson and in other close suburbs of St. Louis is an out-of-state investment firm that has been buying distressed homes to rent them out, a consequence of the foreclosures resulting from the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Aug. 9 shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white police officer in Ferguson put a spotlight on the racial divisions in the United States and the tactics used by the police. But some housing advocates said the incident should also focus attention on how towns like Ferguson are still reeling from the financial crisis and how that also has contributed to heightened tensions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six years after the height of the financial crisis, the housing market in Ferguson remains particularly troubled. Fifty percent of the town's 6,321 homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, a situation called being underwater. Nationally, 17 percent of homeowners are underwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average home in Ferguson sold for $45,032 last year, up from a low of $28,499 in 2011, but still only about half the average price for a home when the market peaked in 2006, according to RealtyTrac, a company that monitors housing sales and foreclosures. Ferguson's slow recovery has created an opening for dozens of investment firms, flush with cash, to descend, buy up homes and rent them to mostly low-income residents. The firms account for roughly a quarter of home purchases in Ferguson, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institutional money has meant a decline in the number of vacant homes and an increase in rental properties, but it has also raised concerns about the long-term intentions of these mainly out-of-town landlords and whether they will upgrade Ferguson's aging housing stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ferguson, 461 families are receiving federal rent subsidies from the Housing Authority of St. Louis County, or roughly 8 percent of the Section 8 vouchers the agency has issued. But the federal subsidies restrict the amount of rent a landlord can charge on a home -- one reason the largest institutional investors, like the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span> and <span class="companylink">Colony American Homes</span>, have largely shunned inner suburbs like Ferguson, where the housing stock tends to be older, in greater need of repair and in poorer neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Into that vacuum have stepped smaller firms like Raineth Housing, which is renting homes to the Walkers and Mr. Bryant and his mother. The firm, co-founded by the financier Edward R. Renwick, is one of the bigger institutional buyers of distressed homes in the St. Louis metropolitan area, acquiring 72 homes in Ferguson, or roughly 5 percent of all the single-family homes sold in the city since 2011, according to RealtyTrac. In the St. Louis metropolitan area, the firm has bought 445 homes in six communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Renwick, who lives in an upscale neighborhood of Los Angeles, said the shooting death of Mr. Brown and the ensuing tense confrontations between the police and residents in Ferguson would not deter his firm from buying properties. ''I don't know anything about policing, but what has happened here is tragic,'' said Mr. Renwick, 48, the chief executive of Raineth, which has also bought hundreds of homes in Kansas City, Mo., and Cincinnati with the $50 million it has raised from investors. ''Ferguson is a great community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an Aug. 15 letter to investors, Mr. Renwick wrote that while he and his partners were ''shocked and saddened'' by the death of Mr. Brown and subsequent rioting by some protesters, Ferguson remained an ''attractive place to live'' with good schools. The firm, which Mr. Renwick runs with his wife, Dehua Chen, and his brother-in-law, Detang Chen, told investors that Raineth planned to keep buying homes in the city and renting them to mainly lower-income families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Renwick said the decision to invest in Ferguson and the St. Louis metro area was made by his brother-in-law, who had attended <span class="companylink">Washington University in St. Louis</span> and developed a fondness for the region. Mr. Renwick, a longtime partner and now a consultant with the <span class="companylink">Yucaipa Companies</span>, the Los Angeles private equity firm led by the billionaire investor Ronald W. Burkle, said Raineth wanted to make money and make a difference in the communities where it bought homes. He said the firm, which is not affiliated with Yucaipa, made up to 40 percent of its homes eligible to families receiving rent subsidies under Section 8, the federal housing assistance program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-third of Ferguson's 21,000 residents are white and two-thirds are black, making it one of the more integrated suburbs in the St. Louis area. But like other older suburbs, Ferguson has lost a fair share of more affluent residents, and lower-income families have taken their place. Aided by federal subsidies, many African-Americans left St. Louis in the 1980s and 1990s for nearby suburbs, changing the racial makeup of communities and creating tension in some cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the St. Louis region there has been movement of white flight,'' said Chris Krehmeyer, chief executive of Beyond Housing, a nonprofit group that works with low-income families in the St. Louis region. ''There's been a wave of movement over time to far-flung suburbia.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other institutional investors that have bought homes in Ferguson and St. Louis County include a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Building and Land Technology</span>, a Stamford, Conn., private equity firm, and Jersey Jennings, a Los Angeles firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing advocates worry about what will happen if investors in firms like Raineth become dissatisfied with the returns from leasing homes to low-income families. The commitment of out-of-state landlords to maintaining properties also is a concern. Tenants and local housing officials have given Raineth mixed grades as a landlord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bryant, 24, who lives on Mueller Avenue in Ferguson, said he and his mother had been generally pleased with their home, which they have rented for four years. He said the landlord's property manager had been fairly responsive about making repairs, although Mr. Bryant said the house, which has white siding and burgundy trim, ''needs to be worked on, or updated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Walkers, who moved into their two-bedroom white brick home on La Motte Lane a year ago, tell a different story. Ethel Walker, 54, a custodian at a local school, said her asthma has worsened because of a persistent mold problem in the house, which she blames on a leaky pipe and water in the basement. More recently, Ms. Walker and her daughter said they had had to deal with raw sewage gurgling up in their yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you'd flush the toilet it'd come up in the backyard,'' Tasha Walker, 31, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Walkers both said they liked the neighborhood and would consider buying the house if the landlord first made more repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We strive to treat our tenants well,'' Mr. Renwick said. ''In this particular case, we received a call from the tenant in question about a toilet issue at 8 p.m. on a Saturday and had the problem repaired on Monday.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Rollins, executive director of the Housing Authority of St. Louis County, said she put Raineth in the ''bottom third'' of landlords receiving federal rent subsidies when it comes to basic repairs and renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Renwick said the agency ''has never expressed any concerns to us'' before now, noting that the housing authority issued rent subsidies for 90 Raineth tenants this year. He added that it can take time to renovate a home with a tenant already living there, like a Raineth house Ms. Rollins visited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Walkers' house is eligible for subsidies, though they do not receive any.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the homes Raineth has bought were built more than 50 years ago and were vacant and in need of renovation. Mr. Renwick said most tenants were single mothers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krehmeyer said the test for investment firms like Raineth could come when they were forced to spend additional money for maintenance. He said the firms could then either sell quickly or simply let the properties deteriorate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Renwick said he understood the apprehension of housing advocates, but contended his investors were in it for the long haul. ''We've designed this so everyone will be happy if we own these homes forever,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was some glumness in the latest news on housing prices. There shouldn’t be. Slower home price rises — and in some markets, outright declines — are a sign the housing market is starting to move past the boom-and-bust cycle of the last dozen years toward a market where sensible prices driven by local economic conditions prevail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price index showed prices rose 8.1 percent in 20 major cities in the 12 months ended in June, the lowest rate of increase since 2012. Compared with May’s prices, national home prices actually declined oh-so-slightly, 0.1 percent, with six major metropolitan areas reporting price declines of more than 1 percent. (Those would be Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Minneapolis.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is this good news? Because the new data offer hints that a disastrous era for housing may be ending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going back to the early 2000s, the housing market has been overwhelmingly driven by national phenomena, first the explosion in loose mortgage lending and bubbly prices that finally peaked in 2006, then the collapse in mortgage credit and prices from 2007 to 2010, and then a gradual recovery in prices since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The differences between markets through that span are largely in amplitude, not direction. For example, Phoenix home prices rose more during the bubble than national prices, collapsed more during the trough, and consequently have recovered more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while national trends like interest rates and mortgage lending standards should influence home prices, many of the forces that should most affect the price of a downtown condo or a suburban split-level are very much local. What kind of job and income growth is a region experiencing? How much does local land-use policy encourage or discourage new housing supply from being built? These are things that ought to determine home prices in a place, but since the early 2000s have been overwhelmed by these national forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jed Kolko, the chief economist of the real estate information service <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, found in a recent analysis [http://www.trulia.com/trends/2014/08/trulia-price-rent-monitors-jul-2014/] that home price increases are now more closely correlated with job growth than with those rebound effects that dominated an earlier phase of the housing recovery. A year ago, by contrast, cities that had the deepest declines during the bust were experiencing the sharpest price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp home price rise of 2013 was in many ways welcome, as it helped millions of Americans get out from being underwater on their mortgages and put prices more in line with long-term fundamentals like incomes and price relative to rents. But if the prices were to keep rising at that pace, we might rapidly find ourselves back in a situation of home prices out of whack with incomes and rents. There are signs that [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/22/upshot/rent-or-buy-the-math-is-changing.html?abt=0002&amp;abg=1] key coastal markets like San Francisco and Los Angeles are already inching close to or even past that point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices can’t rise faster than incomes forever. So if the trend of the last few months continues, and the rate of price increases continues to come down to earth, it will be a sign that maybe, just maybe, we’ve put this long, horrible boom-bust cycle behind us.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American economy is gaining renewed momentum, with data released on Tuesday suggesting strong demand by businesses for airplanes, machinery and other manufactured items, as well as rising confidence among consumers, despite a cooling in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall orders for durable goods in July jumped by 22.6 percent, the biggest one-month increase since the Commerce Department began compiling this series of data in 1992.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That strength, though, was exaggerated by a huge surge in demand for airplanes made by <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding the always-volatile transportation sector, core capital goods orders fell by 0.5 percent in July, but remain up more than 11 percent over the most recent three months on an annualized basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The U.S. economy is on solid ground,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at <span class="companylink">IHS</span>. ''Europe is struggling, Japan is struggling, but all of this suggests the U.S. is doing quite well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe has been hurt by the austerity policies in place across much of the Continent, he said, noting that growth essentially stalled in the second quarter. After a very weak first quarter, Mr. Behravesh estimates the United States economy will grow at a rate of roughly 3 percent over the remainder of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, he said, growth in Europe is running at under a 1 percent pace, while the Japanese economy is expanding at about 1.5 percent on an annualized basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors were encouraged by Tuesday's data, with the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index closing above 2,000, and the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> and <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average showing similar modest gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A healthier job market and the recent surge in stocks, which has lifted the S.&amp;P. 500 into record territory, has helped consumer confidence to rebound. On Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> reported in its monthly survey that its main consumer confidence measure rose in August to its highest level since October 2007, before the start of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although evidence of an upsurge in growth has sometimes worried investors because it could mean a sooner-than-expected increase in interest rates by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, those fears have eased lately in the wake of the reassuring speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., last week by Janet L. Yellen, the <span class="companylink">Fed</span>'s chairwoman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only weak spot in Tuesday's flood of economic indicators was the housing market, where the S.&amp;P./Case-Shiller's index of home prices in 20 cities registered a decline of 0.2 percent in June, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Thirteen out of the 20 cities surveyed showed a fall in home prices, and the drop surprised economists, who had expected the index to remain flat in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing has had a strong recovery in recent years and now it's leveling off,'' Mr. Behravesh said. ''It won't be the engine of growth that it's been, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. We can worry about soft housing prices, but there is no bubble in the making.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS, added that after a strong performance in 2012 and 2013, homes aren't as undervalued as they were previously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With rents going up in recent years, it became more favorable to buy,'' Mr. Berger said. ''The easy gains are behind us in terms of housing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More significant than any cooling in housing is that businesses are beginning to invest more aggressively again, he added, citing the strong figures for durable goods orders Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The main takeaway from today's data is that businesses' spending is moving at a faster pace,'' he said. ''Some is catch-up, and some is acceleration, but it looks set to continue in the third quarter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected a big jump in durable goods demand last month because <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> had announced it received orders for more than 300 planes in July. Still, the eye-popping 22.6 percent gain caught some observers off-guard, even if the impact on the overall economy from aircraft orders is modest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airplane orders can have an outsize impact on monthly durable goods data because of the high dollar value of each jet, sometimes causing the figures to swing sharply. Aircraft like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> 747s and 777s, for example, can cost nearly $400 million each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Aircraft made a big splash, but are relatively inconsequential in terms of the broad economy,'' said Michael Gapen, senior United States economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he noted that the Commerce Department also revised up its estimate view of June orders of core durable goods, which include factory equipment and the like, now estimating that they rose at a 5.4 percent rate rather than 1.4 percent. That meant that the slight decline in the same figure for July still represented a relatively strong level of demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the healthy data for June and July prompted Mr. Gapen and the economics team at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> to increase their estimate for third quarter growth to a rate of 2.7 percent from 2.4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That increase in economic output parallels more recent gains in the labor market, which has lagged overall economic performance for much of the current recovery. When data on unemployment in August is released by the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> in early September, Mr. Gapen expects the jobless rate to fall slightly to 6.1 percent, with employers adding roughly 200,000 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of 2014, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> estimates the country's jobless rate could sink to 5.8 percent, the lowest level in more than six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The moderate to healthy rates of business investment,'' Mr. Gapen said, ''point to some momentum that may feed into the second half of the year.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Encouraging signals from central bankers helped lift Wall Street on Monday, propelling the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index above 2,000 points for the first time. Investors cheered comments from central bankers that suggested continued support for the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KEEPING SCORE The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average rose 0.57 percent and the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index was up 0.65 percent, at 2,001.35 at midday. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite index gained 0.57 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RECORD TERRITORY The benchmark S.&amp;P. 500 crossed above 2,000 in the first hour of trading Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Closing above that level is going to be the big test,'' said J.J. Kinahan, chief strategist at <span class="companylink">TD Ameritrade</span>. ''The S.&amp;P. 500 overall is a sea of green, which is a great thing to see for those who are bullish.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DOUGHNUT KING? <span class="companylink">Burger King</span> jumped 17.2 percent by middayafter news the fast-food chain is in talks to acquire the doughnut chain <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> and create a new holding company headquartered in Canada, a move that could shave its tax bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSING STUMBLE The Commerce Department said sales of new homes slid 2.4 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 412,000. That was down from an upwardly revised June rate. New home sales have struggled to gain traction this year, held back by modest wage growth, a bump in mortgage rates and rising home prices. Several homebuilder stocks turned lower, led by <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes</span> with a decline of about 0.46 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STIMULUS TALK Europe's top central banker said the bank was considering asset purchases to pump more money into Europe's economy, though he gave no guidance on when that would happen. Mario Draghi, head of the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>, said in a speech at Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Friday that the bank was ready to do more to help the eurozone's shaky recovery. His remarks sent European shares higher and the euro currency lower. Hopes of stimulus in France were bolstered by President Francois Hollande's dissolution of his government after an open feud in his <span class="companylink">Cabinet</span> over the country's stagnant economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UNDER PRESSURE A big shareholder in Ann, the parent company of the Ann Taylor and Loft clothing chains, is putting public pressure on management to explore selling the company. The campaign drove Ann shares up 6.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SECTOR WATCH All 10 sectors in the S.&amp;P. 500 rose, with financials leading the pack. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> rose the most in the index, adding about 3 percent. <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> fell the most, losing 2.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OVERSEAS MARKETS Germany's <span class="companylink">DAX</span> advanced 1.6 percent, while France' CAC 40 rose 1.9 percent.

Markets in Asia were mixed, with Japan's benchmark <span class="companylink">Nikkei</span> 225, South Korea's Kospi and Hong Kong's <span class="companylink">Hang Seng</span> each notching gains Monday, while China's Shanghai Composite index and Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 each declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BONDS AND COMMODITIES Bond prices were little changed.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of new single-family homes fell for a second month in July, but a surge in the supply of properties on the market and slower price gains are expected to help stimulate demand in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data on Monday showed activity in the nation's services sector slowed again in August. The reports, however, did little to change views the economy is on a solid growth path, given relatively strong job growth and manufacturing activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing market continues to recover,'' said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span>. ''The fundamentals of strengthening job growth and hopefully stronger wage gains are still favorable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales slipped 2.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 412,000 units, the lowest level since March, the Commerce Department said. While sales were weaker than economists had expected, data for the last three months was revised to show 33,000 more new homes sold than previously reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The soft July sales pace is at odds with other data that has suggested the housing market recovery is back on track after buckling in the second half of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data last week showed an increase in home construction and increased confidence among home builders about future sales and buyer traffic. Sales of used homes hit a 10-month high in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists took the new homes sales data with a grain of salt given it is highly volatile from month to month. Compared with July last year, new home sales were up 12.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the financial data firm Markit said its preliminary purchasing managers index on the services sector dipped to 58.5 this month from 60.8 in July. Still, the index remained well above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction, and it continued to mirror the strong gains seen in manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports suggested that economic growth would proceed at a steady clip in the third quarter, after bouncing back from a weather-related slump at the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A run-up in mortgage rates and a shortage of homes on the market that pushed up prices had cut into sales in the second half of last year, leading the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to express concern at the sluggish housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe that ongoing volatility in housing will be one factor keeping the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> from raising rates prematurely,'' said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing inventory is picking up and home price appreciation is slowing. The inventory of new houses on the market increased to nearly a four-year high, helping to restrain prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price increased 2.9 percent from a year earlier, a sharp slowdown from June, when prices were up 7.8 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At July's sales pace it would take six months to clear the supply of houses on the market, the highest since October 2011.</p>

</div><div class="author">By DIONNE SEARCEY and ELIZABETH A. HARRIS </div><div>896 words</div><div>20 August 2014</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a harsh winter, the nation’s modest housing recovery appears to be back on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction increased sharply in July, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday, as <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, whose fate is tied closely to the housing market, announced a strong quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government said housing starts last month were up nearly 16 percent over June, and almost 22 percent over 12 months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, the country’s largest home improvement retailer, the uptick in demand gave second-quarter earnings a lift. Big-ticket purchases, like appliances, windows and water heaters, increased. The company also reported strong growth among its high-spending professional clients — which indicates that they have work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We believe, in many ways, it’s because of housing, and the fact that housing, while not as robust as last year, continues to recover,” said Carol B. Tomé, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>’s chief financial officer, of the company’s strong results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Tuesday’s numbers from both the government and <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> were each higher than analysts anticipated, economists did not expect to see similar types of surges in housing in the months to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of July’s gains reported by the Commerce Department were in the South, a huge market that showed improvement in both single and multifamily construction after drying out from an exceptionally rainy and muddy spring. Other bright spots in Tuesday’s report were in the multifamily sector, but economists regard those month-to-month numbers as volatile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month’s housing starts were at an annual rate of 1.093 million units, the highest reading since November. Single-family housing starts in July increased 8.3 percent over the revised June figure of 606,000, and were at a rate of 656,000. The July rate for multifamily housing was 423,000, showing the strongest level of starts since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another positive sign, July applications for building permits, which foreshadow construction plans for future, were up 8.1 percent over the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most analysts viewed July’s big leap as having little impact on overall trends in housing, where price increases are slowing down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With the stock of homes for sale well above its cycle lows, price gains slowing and new-home sales flat, it is hard to see why construction would keep rising,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several major factors are holding up the housing recovery. Household formation is almost flat, and well below the 50-year average, said Tom Showalter, chief analytics officer at Digital Risk, which provides mortgage services and risk analytics to lenders. Also, wage growth, which drives housing prices, is still sluggish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A growing economy and improvements in the job market must continue to keep the housing market on track, Mr. Showalter said. He expects housing price appreciation to level off and potentially become negative by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re getting some increased demand so that’s very good,” Mr. Showalter said. “The question is, Can the economy sustain the demand? And that’s a big if.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, sales in the second quarter increased 5.7 percent, to $23.8 billion, from $22.5 billion in the period a year earlier. The company’s earnings [http://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-announces-second-quarter-100000139.html] were $2.05 billion, or $1.52 a share, which exceeded analysts’ expectations and were up from $1.8 billion, or $1.24 a share, in the second quarter of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most crucial housing metric to home improvement retailers is home price appreciation, Ms. Tomé said. When people see their home as an investment, she said, they are more likely to spend money on it than if they see their home as an expense. So as home values rise and people see more equity in their home, they are more likely to spend money to spruce it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home price appreciation growth is lower than it was last year, Ms. Tomé said, “It’s still good news; it’s still headed in the right direction.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said it now expected diluted earnings per share to be up about 20.2 percent, to $4.52 for the year. Its previous guidance was $4.42.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This good news comes at a crucial time of the year for <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> because spring is the most important selling season of the year for home improvement retailers. Those warming months are when consumers head into the garden to tend their flowers or go up on a ladder to patch the roof or replace the windows. But weather can be a strong factor in a consumer’s decision to start a home improvement project that will require spending many hours outdoors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first quarter, which includes the beginning of the spring selling season — and the end of an extraordinarily cold and difficult winter — the company reported disappointing results. Sales at existing stores in the Northeast declined from the year before, and sales at existing stores in its Southern and Western divisions increased.</p>

</div><div class="author">By REUTERS   </div><div>561 words</div><div>20 August 2014</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>The New York Times on the Web</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts surged to an eight-month high in July, suggesting that the nation's housing market recovery was back on track after stalling in the second half of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the rebound points to sustained economic strength, other data released on Tuesday showed that inflation was largely under wraps, which could give the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> room to maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy stance for a bit longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''<span class="companylink">The Fed</span> will find these data further supportive of the go-it-slow approach to exiting its accommodative policies,'' said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreaking for housing jumped 15.7 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.09 million units, the highest level since November, the Commerce Department said. The increase ended two months of declines and beat economists' forecasts of a rise to 969,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the latest sign the market was regaining its footing after being slammed by an increase in interest rates last year. A shortage of properties for sale has also lifted prices, pushing housing out of reach for many first-time customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> said its Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent last month as declining energy costs partly offset increases in food and rent. The index increased 0.3 percent in June. In the 12 months through July, it increased 2 percent after advancing 2.1 percent in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the core C.P.I., which omits volatile food and energy costs, edged up 0.1 percent for a second straight month, economists said there was no evidence that the underlying trend in inflation was shifting lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the year through July, the core C.P.I. was up 1.9 percent. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span> sets a target of 2 percent inflation, but it tracks an index that is running lower than the C.P.I. Many economists do not expect the central bank to raise benchmark rates before the middle of next year, given sluggish wage growth. It has kept rates near zero since December 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Limited inflation and stronger housing are nothing but good news since they imply good growth ahead without the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> having to move prematurely,'' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks rose on the data, with home builders such as Pulte Group and <span class="companylink">D. R. Horton</span> rallying. The PHLX housing sector index was up 1.7 percent in midafternoon trading, outperforming the broader market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another bright sign, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, and it raised its full-year profit forecast, sending its shares up 5.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreaking for single-family homes, the largest part of the market, increased 8.3 percent in July to a seven-month high. Starts for the volatile multifamily segment jumped 33 percent to the highest level since January 2006. This market is being buoyed by a shift toward renting, as many prospective buyers put aside the dream of owning a house. Building permits increased 8.1 percent, the largest gain since April 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery in starts and permits ''puts us back on a modest trend for residential investment activity,'' said Bricklin Dwyer, an economist at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> in New York.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most New Yorkers would barely know what to do with 1,000 square feet of space, let alone 1,000 acres. But what's to stop us from trying to figure it out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a ranch is the stuff of childhood cowboy fantasy -- riding horseback past herds of bison or standing knee-deep in a rushing stream filled with trout. And while foreign investors and tech billionaires drive the New York market, in places like Colorado and Montana, it is cattle shortages and the price of grain that hold sway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are in the market for ranch land and the ultimate anti-Hamptons getaway, there are three types of purchases you can make: farmland, where crops are plowed to yield a harvest; working ranches with large cattle herds that convert grass into beef; and recreational ranches, also called executive ranches or retreats, according to James H. Taylor, who is a principal of Hall and Hall, a real estate company based in Billings, Mont., that specializes in the sale, management and financing of rural property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric O'Keefe, the editor of The Land Report, a quarterly magazine based in Dallas, said: ''Recreational ranches don't have any income streams associated with them. Think of it like buying a Chateau Margaux or a Picasso, just something to enjoy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for recreational ranches soared during the last real estate cycle, but plummeted when the recession hit. So a few million dollars now can buy you acres and acres with panoramic views.Take Chimney Rock Farm on the Tennessee-Kentucky border. The 1,000-acre property includes a historic log cabin that is thought to be the oldest continually occupied log cabin in Kentucky, and was once occupied by President Harry S. Truman's grandparents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When he was a child, President Truman would spend the summers with his grandparents at the cabin,'' said Earl Tally, Chimney Rock Farm's owner. And at $3.9 million, it's a relative bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want to spend a bit more, $24.25 million can buy you Elk River Ranch, an 800-acre property in Colorado that overlooks the Rocky Mountains and is close to big-game hunting, fly-fishing and skiing at Steamboat Resort a few miles down the road. It is owned by John Q. Adams Sr., the man responsible for bringing the cold medication Mucinex to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While they may be beautiful, these recreational ranches have failed to return the same level of investment as farmland and working ranches in recent years. Farms have benefited from several years of skyrocketing prices for corn and wheat, although prices for these commodities have dropped over the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices of working cattle ranches, meanwhile, have also gone up because of several droughts that have caused a nationwide beef cattle shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The U.S. cow herd is at a historic low right now, the last time it was at this level was 1952,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''When coupled with the increased demand by growing worldwide populations for high quality protein, such as beef, it has caused the price of beef, and therefore, the demand for ranch land, to go through the ceiling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for recreational ranches, on the other hand, have fallen 35 percent to 50 percent since the market peak, Mr. Taylor said, and there are now several properties available at steep discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Crazy French Ranch (owned by, you guessed it, a French couple), recently slashed its asking price by nearly 25 percent to $59 million. The ranch is 62 square miles, or nearly triple the size of Manhattan, and offers 4,000 feet of elevation change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a whole bunch of different biospheres, from meadow planes to juniper trees and forests,'' said Henry S. Field, the broker who is representing the property. ''It is a wild place. On my first trip up there I saw four bears, and I wasn't even looking for them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The singer Carole King put her ranch in Stanley, Idaho, near Sun Valley on the market back in 2007 for $19 million. The 128-acre Robinson Bar Ranch, which Ms. King has owned for more than three decades, is now priced at $9.9 million. Adjacent to the Salmon River, it includes a 7,000-square-foot lodge, guest cabins, and of course, a professional recording studio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the market for these ranches remains soft, there are compelling reasons to buy them, including the possibility of creating conservation easements. In these instances, a ranch owner sells or donates the development rights on the property to a land trust in exchange for a tax deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the most notable trends we've been following is the increasing appeal of conservation properties to high-net-worth individuals,'' Mr. O'Keefe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax benefits are the main draw, he said, but many are also compelled by ''the social component to preserving open spaces.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider Louis Bacon of Moore Capital, a New York City hedge fund honcho who broke a record in 2007 when he paid $175 million for a ranch in Colorado owned by the Forbes family. In 2012, Mr. Bacon placed 167,000 acres of the 171,400-acre Trinchera Blanca Ranch into a conservation easement with the <span class="companylink">United States Fish and Wildlife Service</span>. It was the largest single conservation easement in the agency's history, and the largest conservation easement in Colorado, Mr. O'Keefe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying large tracts also can provide an opportunity for the very wealthy to diversify their investments. In an economy where interest rates are low and bonds provide little return, parking cash in land can be a useful strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are seeing more cash buyers in the market right now,'' said Mike Swan of the Swan Land Company, a real estate brokerage firm. ''Because the stock market won't stay where it is forever, people are pulling up their investments and putting the money into land where there is not the same amount of volatility.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Swan is marketing Forked Lightning Ranch in New Mexico, which belongs to the Oscar-winning actress Jane Fonda, for $19.5 million. Ms. Fonda is also selling separately her personal collection of antiques, artwork and even her literary collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of Ms. Fonda, no column on ranches would be complete without mentioning her ex-husband, Ted Turner, the country's second-largest landholder with two million acres. (The media mogul John C. Malone surpassed him in 2011 when he bought one million acres of timberland in Maine, putting his total acreage at 2.2 million, according to the Land Report.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ted Turner was the first to spend a significant amount of money for a ranch -- the first big ranch he bought was for $21 million,'' said Mr. Taylor, who worked with Mr. Turner on many of his ranch purchases, including his first in 1987. ''Before that, a $6 million sale was considered a large transaction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While owning thousands of acres out West may be a dream-come-true, there are a number of complications to consider, such as ancillary costs. If you have a large ranch of a few hundred thousand acres, for example, you'll need to hire a ranch manager to help you run the property, with a base salary of up to $250,000 a year, according to Mr. Taylor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And pay attention to things like water rights, mineral rights, deed encumbrances, county zoning, soil profiles and property access, Mr. Swan added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After the recent recession,'' he said, ''buyers have become more cautious and are doing extensive research on properties before they engage.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Middle class migrating to inland cities</span>
</div><div class="author">By SHAILA DEWAN   </div><div>1467 words</div><div>5 August 2014</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>16</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans have never hesitated to pack up in search of the big time, a better job or just warmer weather. But these days, domestic migrants are increasingly driven by the quest for cheaper housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country’s fastest-growing cities are now those where housing is more affordable than average, a decisive reversal from the early years of the millennium, when easy credit allowed cities to grow without regard to housing cost and when the fastest-growing cities had housing that was less affordable than the national average. Among people who have moved long distances, the number of those who cite housing as their primary motivation for doing so has more than doubled since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rents and the difficulty of securing a mortgage on the coasts have proved a boon to inland cities that offer the middle class a firmer footing and an easier life. In the eternal competition among urban centers, the shift has produced some new winners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oklahoma City, for example, has outpaced most other cities in growth since 2011, becoming the 12th-fastest-growing city in the United States last year. It has also won over a coveted demographic, young adults age 25 to 34, going from a net loss of millennials to a net gain. Other affordable cities that have jumped in the growth rankings include several in Texas, including El Paso and San Antonio, as well as Columbus, Ohio, and Little Rock, Ark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newcomers in Oklahoma City have traded traffic jams and preschool waiting lists for master suites the size of their old apartments. The sons of Lorin Olson, a stem cell biologist who moved to Oklahoma City from New York’s Upper East Side, now ride bikes in their suburban neighborhood and go home to a four-bedroom house. Hector Lopez, a caricature artist, lives in a loft apartment for less than he paid to stay in a garage near Los Angeles. Tony Trammell, one of a group of about a dozen friends to make the move from San Diego, paid $260,000 for his 3,300-square-foot home in an Oklahoma City suburb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the start of the recession, the number of Americans who have moved each year has fallen sharply for a host of reasons, including the sluggish economy and the increasing similarity of job options from city to city. When people do move, they have all kinds of reasons, including family, climate and, especially for those who move long distances, employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of those who moved more than 500 miles, the share who said they were chiefly motivated by housing has risen to 18 percent in 2014, from 8 percent in 2007, the earliest year such data is available, according to the <span class="companylink">United States Census Bureau</span>. The desire for a new, better or cheaper home and the opportunity to buy instead of rent were among the housing-related reasons people cited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story was different from 2000 to 2006, when cities with high-cost housing grew more quickly than those with affordable housing, according to an analysis of metro areas by Redfin, a national real estate brokerage firm. From 2006 to 2012 — years that encompass the housing bust, recession and recovery — that pattern reversed itself, with most low-cost cities growing 2.5 percentage points more than high-cost cities. The analysis excluded cities with poor job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the real estate market crashed, housing in four of the five fastest-growing metropolitan areas, including Cape Coral, Fla., and Riverside, Calif., was less affordable than in the average American city, judging by the relationship between the median home price and income for each metropolitan area. But from 2008 to 2012, all five of the cities with the most growth were more affordable than average, including the Raleigh-Durham, N.C., area and the cities of El Paso, San Antonio, Austin and McAllen in Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘A large percentage of Americans had to read ‘The Grapes of Wrath,’’’ said Mayor Mick Cornett of Oklahoma City, referring to the John Steinbeck novel that chronicled the flight of Oklahomans to California in search of a better life during the Depression. Now the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of those migrants are returning for the same reason. ‘‘It’s ‘The Wrath of Grapes,’’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor cited clean air, a lack of traffic gridlock and, of course, affordable housing as factors in the city’s growth. But like other midsize cities, this one has labored to give people additional reasons to move here, notably acquiring a professional basketball team, the Thunder. Along the river, a series of modern glass boathouses has risen like wind-filled sails, transforming the city into a national center for rowing sports. All 73 inner-city schools are being rebuilt or refurbished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downtown, there is enough streetscaping going on to render a GPS unit useless. And near the city’s historic neighborhoods, chockablock with houses in Arts and Crafts or storybook style, rejuvenated commercial areas like the Plaza District offer locally made goods and trendy ‘‘beer cocktails.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Everything is here; everything is coming here,’’ said Aasim Saleh, 30, who moved from Seattle to coach kayaking in the Boathouse District, where construction of a new white-water center is planned for this fall. ‘‘If Oklahoma City doesn’t have it, they’ll build it.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Saleh moved because he had a rare opportunity to make about $60,000 a year while avoiding a desk job. The low cost of living was a major sweetener, he said, enabling him to become something he thought would not be possible: a homeowner. ‘‘I would say that, 100 percent, I had given up on the idea of homeownership in Seattle,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the newcomers say that as they contemplated living with roommates, sitting in traffic and barely scraping by, the good things about life in a high-cost city lost their appeal. ‘‘The beach isn’t going to pay my rent,’’ said Jacqueline Sit, 32, who left Portland, Ore., where she worked as a television reporter, to come to Oklahoma City, where she quickly found a job in public relations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Olson, 42, who was recruited by the <span class="companylink">Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation</span> after finishing his postdoctoral work, said his family had not shed tears over leaving New York. ‘‘There’s a little less to do, yeah,’’ he said. ‘‘But now we can afford to do it.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenn Kelman, the chief executive of Redfin, said that when the company started its real estate service in 2006, he expected the business to thrive in coastal centers. ‘‘Now we’re growing fastest in the middle of the country; we can’t hire people fast enough in Houston, in Dallas, in Denver. And all of our customers come from the same place — the airport,’’ he said. ‘‘Maybe the middle class hasn’t disappeared; maybe it’s just gone somewhere else.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, Americans have flocked to the Sun Belt in search of a better life, first abandoning failing industrial centers like Detroit and Pittsburgh and then increasingly expensive cities like New York and San Francisco, which have been replenished by immigrants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But during the housing bubble, when even people with modest salaries could get loans to buy staggeringly expensive homes, the cost of housing was less of a concern. Now that getting a mortgage has become harder, the wage stagnation that has hobbled the middle class for years has deeper consequences. ‘‘People have no choice,’’ Mr. Kelman said. ‘‘They can’t move across the street; they have to move across the country.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the bubble, people coming from the most expensive places viewed even moderately expensive housing in places like Phoenix as a bargain, especially if they expected the value of such housing to rise, says Edward L. Glaeser, a <span class="companylink">Harvard</span> economist who studies cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, Mr. Glaeser says, there is also a historical trend driven by severe restrictions on building new housing in highly regulated cities like San Francisco, Washington and New York. Whereas high housing prices were once a sign of growth because they indicated strong demand, now they are more a function of limited supply. Midlevel prices (as opposed to rock-bottom values in places like Detroit) have become a better predictor of growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the fastest-growing cities, like Austin, may become victims of their own success as new people crowd in. Bill Curtis, an affluent petroleum geologist, has lived there since 1976, when it was known for little more than legislative wheeling and dealing and college football. On a recent day, he was unhappily contemplating traffic from his high-rise apartment. ‘‘They’ve screwed this town up so royally, it’s unbelievable,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Curtis has a solution. He’s moving to Oklahoma City.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home prices in the United States rose in May from a year earlier at the weakest pace in 15 months, as sales remained modest in the spring buying season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index, released Tuesday, increased 9.3 percent in May from 12 months earlier. That is down from 10.8 percent in the previous month and the smallest annual gain since February 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> reported that consumers were more confident about the economy than they had been in nearly seven years. Its confidence index rose to 90.9 in July, from an upwardly revised 86.4 in June. The July reading is the highest since October 2007, two months before the recession officially began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In home prices, early price gains slowed in 18 of the 20 cities. They accelerated in Charlotte, N.C., and were flat in Tampa, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices soared last fall and winter but have been steadily returning to a more sustainable level this year. Existing-home sales have picked up, rising to an eight-month high in June. But they are still 2.3 percent below last year's level. And an index of signed contracts dipped in June, suggesting sales will cool. At the same time, the number of homes for sale has increased, giving buyers more choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After steady gains early last year, home sales have been restrained by weak wage increases and tight credit, particularly for first-time buyers. Mortgage rates also rose last summer, slowing sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index covers roughly half of American homes. The index measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The May figures are the latest available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities in the West and South showed some of the biggest increases. Prices rose 16.9 percent in Las Vegas from a year earlier, the largest gain, followed by a 15.4 percent increase in San Francisco and 13.2 percent in Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other housing data have painted a mixed picture of the real estate market. While sales of existing homes have picked up, new-home sales plummeted in June. And new home construction has fallen for two straight months. That could lead to fewer construction jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home prices have risen steadily since housing began to recover in 2012. The Case-Shiller index has risen 27.3 percent after bottoming out in March 2012. But home prices remain about 17 percent below the peaks reached in the summer of 2006, just before the housing crisis hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> reported its third straight increase in the consumer confidence index. Economists said strong job growth has helped bolster consumers' assessment of current conditions and also improved their outlook on jobs and the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lynn Franco, a <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> economist, says the improvements in consumers' confidence and expectations about the future indicate that the recent strengthening in overall economic growth should continue in the second half of the year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Fewer Americans signed contracts to buy homes in June, as the real estate market appears to have cooled off this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Monday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index slipped 1.1 percent to 102.7 last month. The index remains 7.3 percent below its level a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have been slowed by a mix of meager wage growth, rising home prices and mortgage rates that rose steadily through the end of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales are a barometer of future purchases. A one- to two-month lag usually exists between a contract and a completed sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signed contracts in June fell in the Northeast and South. They rose slightly in the Midwest and West. Pending sales in all four United States regions are below last year's pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales had been improving through the middle of 2013, but stumbled over the last 12 months. Buying has decelerated despite a recent decline in mortgage rates and home prices' increasing at a slower rate than last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were initially disrupted by harsh winter weather, but the summer slowdown suggests that financial pressures are now keeping would-be buyers on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The latest decline raises questions about the housing market strength after the weather-related rebound is behind us,'' said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an analyst at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>. ''Housing will remain an area of concern'' for the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell 8.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 406,000, the Commerce Department said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group recently reported that sales of used homes increased 2.6 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.04 million homes. It was the first time that sales had been above five million since October, yet the pace of buying remained below last year's level of 5.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists generally consider annual home sales of 5.5 million to be consistent with a healthy housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are indications that sales could pick up. Along with the arrival of spring, average mortgage rates have dropped to 4.13 percent, down from a 52-week high of 4.58 percent, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of average price gains has slowed to 4.3 percent year-over-year, according to the Realtors group. That is down from gains in the double digits. But wage growth has barely kept pace with inflation, eating into how much income people have to spend and save for down payments.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since moving to Odessa, Tex., in September to work as a state Child Protective Services investigator, Juan Carlos Pacheco has had three homes, struggling to find a place he could afford. At one point, he shared a one-bedroom apartment with six people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a situation kind of like a sardine can,'' said Mr. Pacheco, 29, who now rents a room in the house of a family of four. His wife, 1-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son live in El Paso.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil boom that has brought jobs and prosperity to Midland and Odessa has driven up housing prices, making it difficult for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to hire caseworkers at a time when the agency is under pressure to fill jobs after the high-profile deaths of two foster children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midland had the nation's highest increase in median home value after the recession, according to a NerdWallet study last month that examined census data from 2009 to 2012 for 510 cities. The median home price in the Midland metro area last month was $283,100 -- the highest in Texas, according to the Real Estate Center at <span class="companylink">Texas A&amp;M University</span>. (<span class="companylink">Texas A&amp;M</span> is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is an overwhelming problem,'' said John Specia, the family and protective services commissioner. ''The rents have tripled or more. We have a number of people who want to transfer to other areas because it's like getting an immediate boost in pay.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The department has tried to fill vacancies by temporarily sending workers from elsewhere in the state to the Midland and Odessa area; offering new caseworkers $5,000 signing bonuses, a practice since discontinued; and giving all 153 workers in the area $500-a-month housing supplements. A typical rate for a one-bedroom apartment in Midland is $1,100 a month, Mayor Jerry Morales said recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the housing supplement, Mr. Pacheco's annual pay is about $49,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Specia said the housing supplements had not ''stemmed the tide'' of workers leaving. Because of the nature of the work -- the agency has 24 hours to investigate urgent reports that a child faces harm -- ''we don't have the luxury of teleworking,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Camille Gilliam became the department's regional director a year and a half ago, there were so many vacancies that 200 children did not have caseworkers, she said. Bringing in reinforcements has helped, and she tells new hires that they are ''doing God's work.'' But employees continue to resign or transfer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One employee, Ms. Gilliam said, recently transferred to Houston to escape her Odessa home: a trailer with electrical problems and no running water. Another is staying in the area in a better-paying job, as a manager for Domino's Pizza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of 18 investigator jobs in Ector County, including Odessa, seven were vacant; five were filled by new hires; and six were held by workers who had been on the job for at least a year, Ms. Gilliam said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Children need to be able to develop a trusting relationship with their caseworker,'' she said. ''But if you have four caseworkers in a year, how are you really able to do that successfully?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said more money could solve the turnover problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But State Representative Richard Peña Raymond, chairman of the House Human Services Committee, said raises might not help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're working with the agency on what can be done salary-wise, but if you've got a housing shortage, I'm not sure what the state can do,'' said Mr. Raymond, a Laredo Democrat. ''That's kind of the private sector.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the state is responsible for 16,700 children in foster care and 10,000 being cared for by relatives. Among them were two Austin-area girls, Alexandria Hill, 2, and Orion Hamilton, 11 months, who died last year from head injuries that led to murder charges for adults in their foster homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those deaths increased scrutiny on the department, which is using an infusion of money from the Legislature to hire more caseworkers statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pacheco said his position in Odessa was an opportunity he would not have had in El Paso, where he found stiff competition for such work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a very good job,'' he said. ''I've been growing as a person here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His wife hopes to join him soon, he said. Their goal is to buy a house in Odessa.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market rose on Tuesday as some positive earnings and economic data pointed to a market that still had room to rise despite the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index flirting with another closing high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 23 percent of S.&amp;P. 500 companies having reported results this quarter, 66.1 percent posted earnings that topped expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, above the long-term average of 63 percent. More than 64 percent have beaten revenue forecasts, above the long-term average of 61 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the companies posting earnings, <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications</span> rose 28 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $50.98, after the company reported revenue that topped expectations. <span class="companylink">Chipotle Mexican Grill</span> was the S.&amp;P. 500's biggest percentage gainer, surging $69.84, or 11.8 percent, to $659.77, a day after the burrito chain reported a steep jump in profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Netflix</span>, one of the market's biggest trading favorites over the last few years, reported a quarterly profit that more than doubled on Monday after the market closed. But on Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> shares fell 4.6 percent, to $431.09, as the company's plans to expand in Europe were seen as eroding profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So far earnings have been pretty robust, better than a lot of people were looking for, including on the forward guidance side,'' said William B. Greiner, chief investment officer at <span class="companylink">Mariner Wealth Advisors</span>. ''There are some concerns about valuation, but stocks remain a more attractive asset class than bonds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp;P. 500 gained 9.90 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,983.53, putting it 2 points below its closing high, set on July 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average rose 61.81 points, or 0.36, percent, to close at 17,113.54. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite index added 31.31 points, or 0.71 percent, to 4,456.02.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equities have been strong in 2014, with July on track to be the S.&amp;P. 500's sixth straight monthly advance. The index is up 7.3 percent so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the economic news, sales of existing homes hit an eight-month high in June, suggesting the housing market was gradually regaining momentum and would help the economy to stay on a higher growth path this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third straight month of home sales gains, reported by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Tuesday, showed that existing home sales rose 2.6 percent to an annual rate of 5.04 million units last month, with the median house price hitting its highest level since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders' stocks gained after the report. <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> shares rose 46 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $24.30, while <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes</span> advanced 38 cents, or 2 percent, to $19.21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second report from the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> showed that a surge in gasoline prices pushed up inflation in June, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a slow and modest buildup of inflationary pressures. The Consumer Price Index increased 0.3 percent last month, with gasoline accounting for two-thirds of the gain, after a 0.4 percent rise in May. In the 12 months through June, the C.P.I. was up 2.1 percent, the same as in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Removing food and energy prices, the so-called core C.P.I. rose 0.1 percent after an increase of 0.3 percent in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the closing bell on Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> reported a rise in revenue, though earnings fell in part as a result of the effect of incorporating the handset business of <span class="companylink">Nokia</span>, which it acquired in April. <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s stock rose above $45 in after-hours trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Apple</span> reported third-quarter earnings that topped expectations, though revenue missed forecasts. <span class="companylink">Apple</span>'s stock fell in after-hours trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the bond market, interest rates were stable. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note was unchanged at 2.47 percent, while its price rose 1/32, to 100 10/32.</p>

<div>The Upshot</div>
<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Housing Starts Fell in June. Here's Why That's Bad News.</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember when 2014 was going to be the year home building finally got out of the doldrums and accelerated back toward health — or at least to filling something closer to its usual role supporting growth? Yeah, never mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s right, another disappointing reading on the housing market was released Thursday morning. The number of housing units that builders started work on fell 9.3 percent in June, to an 893,000 annual rate. The number of housing permits issued by local governments, a forward-looking measure that government statisticians consider less prone to measurement error, fell 4.2 percent. Forecasters had expected both numbers to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For context, economists think the United States needs to build something on the order of 1.5 million [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/upshot/the-housing-market-is-still-holding-back-the-economy-heres-why.html?_r=0] new housing units a year to keep up with a growing population and older homes falling into disrepair. The nation hasn’t consistently built more than 1 million a year since the 2008 recession. Instead, home-building activity has mostly been bouncing around in the 900,000 to 1 million range since the start of 2013, not exhibiting any clear signs of acceleration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes the June results curious — and particularly disappointing — is that some of the excuses heard for weak housing numbers don’t hold water any more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unusually bad winter weather that slowed construction in January and February is now long past. If anything, you might expect a catch-up effect from projects delayed then to be a bit of a tailwind for housing this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And mortgage rates spiked in the second half of 2013, perhaps leading builders to exercise a greater note of caution as they weighed new projects. But rates have fallen more or less steadily through the first half of 2014. The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.5 percent at the start of the year, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, but was 4.1 percent at the end of May, as builders were starting to plan how many houses to begin building in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s not that the report was uniformly negative. Permits issued for single-family homes, as opposed to apartment buildings with many units, actually rose a bit, from a 615,000 annual rate to 631,000. The decline was concentrated in permits issued for homes in projects with more than five units, which have been a mainstay of construction activity in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the decline in housing starts was entirely concentrated in the Southern states, the region that by the census’s definition stretches from Delaware to Texas. Housing starts actually increased in each of the other three census regions, but fell by a 158,000 annual rate in the South. That could be an aberration, but it bears watching in future months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless, the basic lesson to be learned from the latest housing numbers is a simple one: The housing recovery is, at best, weak. And it may not be much of a recovery at all.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to sustained momentum in the economy even as home building fell for a second month in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy's improving fortunes were underscored by another report on Thursday showing that manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated to its highest level in nearly three and a half years this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The labor market is tightening, firms are not cutting workers and people are finding jobs,'' said Joel L. Naroff, president of an economic consultant group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 302,000 for the week ended July 12, the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> said. Economists had forecast a rise to 310,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week average of jobless claims, considered a better gauge of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, hit its lowest level in seven years, dropping 3,000, to 309,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said groundbreaking on new homes fell 9.3 percent in June from May, to a seasonally adjusted annual 893,000 unit-pace, a nine-month low. The drop was led a 29.6 percent plunge in housing starts in the South. Economists had expected starts to rise to an annual rate of 1.02 million units. Housing is struggling to get back on track since stalling in late 2013. But there are glimmers of hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While overall building permits fell 4.2 percent in June to a pace of 963,000 units, single-family permits -- the largest segment of the market -- hit their highest level since November. Building permits are now running ahead of housing starts, which suggests a pickup in construction activity in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey on Wednesday showed confidence among single-family home builders touched a six-month high in July, reflecting optimism over sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia</span> said its business activity index rose to 23.9 in July, its highest since March 2011, from 17.8 in June. Any reading above zero indicates expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders scaled a 10-year high, and factory employment also accelerated.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Investors pushing up home prices; Off The Charts</span>
</div><div class="author">BY FLOYD NORRIS   </div><div>619 words</div><div>5 July 2014</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>13</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street is driving up home prices in the United States again, but this time it is not through granting mortgages to customers who cannot afford the houses. Instead, it is institutional investors who have been buying up relatively inexpensive homes, particularly in areas hard hit by foreclosures during and after the Great Recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Atlanta area, prices of the least expensive homes have more than doubled since March 2012, when home prices across America hit bottom, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span>/Case-Shiller indexes of home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is by far the best performance for relatively inexpensive homes in any of the 16 markets in which the S.&amp;P./Case-Shiller indexes break out performance by thirds of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta is also the market where institutional investors have been most active, accounting for 14 percent of the homes purchased there during the most recent eight quarters, according to figures compiled by RealtyTrac. Those investors purchase homes to rent out to others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Local investors have been telling us for some time that the institutional investors are pushing up prices, particularly at the foreclosure auctions, beyond what the local investor is willing to pay,’’ said Daren Blomquist, a RealtyTrac vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘When we look at our data, it’s clear that the home price recovery has been largely driven by investors and other cash buyers,’’ he added. ‘‘As those investors and cash buyers slow down their purchases, the big question becomes, ‘Will demand from owner-occupant buyers be enough to keep the sales and prices moving higher?’’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accompanying charts show the trends in the 16 markets for lower-priced homes — the bottom third of the market — and for more expensive homes — the top third of the market. They also show how inexpensive a home had to be to qualify for the bottom third in that region. The regions where institutional buyers were particularly active are listed first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures are intended to cover broad metropolitan areas — basically the entire region in which people working in each city might choose to live — and they cover only single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a strong relationship between overall price levels and institutional involvement. There are seven markets in which a $200,000 home would be in the middle third, rather than the lower third of all homes. Those seven are all among the eight regions where institutional purchasers were most active.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the three California markets listed — Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco — the cutoff for homes in the lower third is over $400,000. Those markets have had relatively low institutional participation, but low-priced homes have done well. Prices are up nearly 50 percent in Los Angeles and San Diego and by more than 70 percent in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In each of the 16 areas, lower-priced homes have risen more rapidly than have higher-priced homes, at least in percentage terms. Of course, prices of the upper third may have risen by more dollars, even if the percentage change is not as large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York City area, which includes areas of Connecticut and New Jersey, has behaved differently from other regions. There, lower-priced homes are up only 10 percent over the period, far less than in any of the other 15 markets, and little more than the 9 percent gain for higher-priced homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower-priced homes tended to do worse during the market crash, in part because they were more likely to face foreclosure. Even with the recent rises, prices for that sector are still lower than the prerecession peaks in each of the markets other than Denver.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index and the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite index wrapped up a sixth straight quarter of gains on Monday, a streak not seen in more than 14 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall stock market, however, showed little change for the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the S.&amp;P. 500's nearly 30 percent gain last year, many investors had expected a halt to an equity bull market that is now in its fifth year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> has now recorded its longest streak of quarterly gains since 2000. For the S.&amp;P. 500, this is the best run of quarterly gains since 1998. The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average also had its fifth positive quarter of the last six.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the second quarter, the S.&amp;P. 500 jumped 4.7 percent, the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> shot up 5 percent and the <span class="companylink">Dow</span> gained 2.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are overextended in the short term, and I do see a bit of a near-term correction, but the dips are seen as opportunities to put cash to work,'' said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. ''I think the third quarter of the year will be very much like what we just experienced.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the <span class="companylink">Dow</span> fell 25.24 points or 0.15 percent, to close at 16,826.60. The S.&amp;P. 500 dipped 0.73 of a point, or 0.04 percent, to 1,960.23. But the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> added 10.25 points or 0.23 percent, to 4,408.18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp;P. 500 set 22 record closing highs so far this year, which has increased concerns among some investors that the market might be due for a technical pullback. Yet the <span class="companylink">CBOE</span> volatility index, Wall Street's fear gauge known as the VIX, has held near multiyear lows. The VIX ended on Monday up 2.8 percent at 11.57.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent Reuters poll showed market participants expect the benchmark S.&amp;P. 500 to hit 2,000 for the first time before the year ends. That milestone would represent a gain of about 8.2 percent from 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We still think a move into the 1,980-2,000 level is possible, but it will not be a huge surprise if 1,950 is revisited multiple times as we move through the summer months,'' said Todd Salamone, senior vice president of research at Schaeffer's Investment Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the market barely reacted after data from the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago showed the pace of business activity in June in the Midwest dipped more than expected from a seven-month high, and the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' pending home sales index showed contracts to buy previously owned homes hit an eight-month high in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a short week and slowing trading because of the Fourth of July holiday on Friday, and with the June employment report expected Thursday, traders say there may be increased volatility in a market that has been placid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the stocks on the move, <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> fell 32 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $36.30, after the automaker said it was recalling 8.4 million vehicles worldwide, bringing its total recalls so far this year above 28 million cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of New York Mellon</span> rose $1.25, or 3.5 percent, to $37.48 after <span class="companylink">Trian Fund Management</span> disclosed in a regulatory filing that it had acquired a stake of more than nine million shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MannKind surged 99 cents, or 9.9 percent, to $10.99, following the <span class="companylink">Food and Drug Administration</span>'s approval of Afrezza, the company's inhaled insulin product, which is delivered using a whistle-size inhaler. The F.D.A. said Friday that the company's product offered a new treatment option for patients with diabetes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the bond market, interest rates were little changed. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note dipped to 2.53 percent, from 2.54 percent, while its price inched up 1/32, to 99 23/32.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contracts to buy previously owned homes reached an eight-month high in May, the latest indication that housing was pulling out of a recent soft patch. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Monday that its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, increased 6.1 percent to 103.9, the highest level since September of last year. The percentage increase was the largest since April 2010, just before the expiration of a tax credit for first-time home buyers, and it far outpaced economists' expectations for an advance of only a 1.5 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spring failed to inspire a surge in home sales nationally this year, even though mortgage rates are still reasonably low. Although economists insist that the housing market is on an upward trend, abnormal conditions left over from the recession continue to be a drag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications for home purchases as of June were down 15 percent from the same period last year, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>. And sales of existing homes were about 6 percent weaker this spring compared with 2013, the association said. (In May alone, sales were down 5 percent from the previous year, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported on Monday.) So what is holding buyers back? At least three major dynamics are at work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MISSING SUPPLY OF HOMES Many markets are undersupplied with the homes buyers are looking for. One reason is that homeowners who refinanced when interest rates were very low now have little incentive to sell, as they would almost certainly have to buy at higher rates. According to Mark Fleming, the chief economist for <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real estate information service, almost half of all mortgaged homeowners obtained financing at rates of less than 4.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've locked all these people into low rates,'' Mr. Fleming said during a conference this month of the National Association of Real Estate Editors in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, many homeowners who would like to sell and move up do not have enough equity in their homes. And then there are the houses stuck in the foreclosure pipeline -- the so-called shadow inventory. Mr. Fleming estimated that nearly two million homes have yet to come to market, primarily in states with slower judicial processes for foreclosure, including New York, New Jersey and Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UNEMPLOYED YOUNG ADULTS The engine of recovery is dependent upon young people forming new households, but they are still struggling, said Jed Kolko, the chief economist for <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a real estate website, and another conference speaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joblessness among adults 25 to 34 was among the highest of all age groups during the recession. From 2009 to 2012, the employment rate for young adults dipped as low as 73 percent, compared with 81 percent in 2001, Mr. Kolko said. It is currently at about 75 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While people in this age group are beginning to find employment and move out of their parents' homes, for now, they are primarily renting, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INVESTORS DRIVING UP PRICES In some areas like Las Vegas and Phoenix, first-time buyers are in competition with institutional investors, who are buying up cheaper homes by the hundreds to turn into rental properties. Last year, strong investor demand helped drive a rise in home prices that was significantly ahead of household income growth, according to a recent report by Mark Palim, a vice president in the economic and strategic research group at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investor activity appears to have peaked, which means the market will shift to what Mr. Kolko describes as ''a slower but more sustainable recovery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there may be some bright spots ahead. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics is predicting stronger purchase activity in the second half of the year and in 2015. Celia Chen, a senior director of economic research at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, attributes the more positive outlook to job growth. Access to mortgage financing could also improve as lenders compete more aggressively for purchase business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> also predicts that mortgage rates will remain around 4.5 percent for the rest of the year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By NEIL IRWIN </div><div>848 words</div><div>26 June 2014</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>12</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the United States are rising more slowly than they were just a few months ago, according to new data out on Tuesday — and that may well be just what the housing market needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index of home prices in 20 major cities rose 0.2 percent in April, down from 1.2 percent in March and well below the 0.8 percent that analysts forecast. Over the last year, prices have risen 10.8 percent, compared with a 13.7 percent gain in the year that ended in November, the recent peak. A second report on home prices out Tuesday, from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, showed the same pattern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the number of new-home sales rose to a 504,000 annual rate in May, far above the 439,000 analysts had expected, a positive sign for housing. And the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>’s consumer confidence index rose to 85.2, from 82.2 in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts have worried that the rapid rise of home prices — which have climbed much faster than incomes in most metropolitan areas — might lead to new excesses in the housing market. Jed Kolko, the chief economist of Trulia, estimates that national home prices are only 3 percent undervalued relative to long-term fundamentals, and that a handful of locations, particularly in Southern California, are now significantly overvalued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That being the case, moderation in the rate of home price gains could be good news, in the sense that buyers are less likely than they were a decade ago to stretch to buy a home at any price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Although it may seem counterintuitive, this is actually welcome news, because it means that we’re not looking at a bubble,’’ Patrick Newport and Stephanie Karol of <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight wrote in a report. ‘‘A smaller yearly increase over a higher base is a healthy sign for the housing market: Homeowners continue to build equity, but home purchases remain within the realm of possibility for buyers.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current home price levels are far from the clear bubble levels of 2006. Mr. Kolko, for example, finds that the frothiest market in the United States is Orange County, Calif., which by his measures is 17 percent overvalued relative to fundamentals like rents and incomes. In early 2006 it was 71 percent overvalued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, those moderate potential overvaluations could easily become major ones if double-digit price increases rise too much longer. In a world where inflation is low and wages are flat, continued steep home-price increases would rapidly move the housing market from broadly balanced to unaffordable and primed for a correction in just a few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what makes this housing recovery seem healthier and more sustainable than the bubble of the early 2000s. Then, even as home prices soared beyond any traditional level relative to income, home buyers responded by taking on more risk and buying anyway, speculating on further home price gains. And they were encouraged to do so by profit-mad lenders who threw caution to the wind in the belief that housing prices could never collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, mortgage lenders are exercising much more restraint, and home buyers seem to be looking at high valuations and not getting caught up in the excitement, instead drawing the line and paying no more than they can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price numbers tend to move in steadier, more gradual waves than other economic data. They also come out with long delays; the April Case-Shiller numbers are actually based on transactions that closed from February through April — and those home sales generally went under contract a month or two before they closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the latest home price readings are very much a look in the rearview mirror, and it is a look that suggests a deceleration is underway. The question is where it will ultimately settle. If prices were rising 13 percent in the year ended in November and 11 percent in April, what will, or should, the level be later in 2014?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The healthiest thing for the housing market would be home-price rises that thread the needle: High enough that homeowners are building equity and homebuilders have incentive to start new construction, but low enough that they do not significantly outpace wage growth and result in unaffordable housing and a painful correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gus Faucher, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span>, forecasts exactly that, predicting low- to mid-single-digit home price appreciation through the rest of 2014 and into next year. ‘‘This is roughly equal to income growth, and thus is sustainable over the longer run,’’ he wrote in a report on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the price rises were strongest in the West, with San Francisco home prices rising 18.2 percent over the past year, according to the Case-Shiller index, and Las Vegas prices up 18.8 percent. The weakest price rise among 20 major metro areas was in Cleveland, with only a 2.7 percent increase.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Sales of previously owned homes in the United States rose more than expected in May, and the stock of properties for sale was the highest in more than 18 months, suggesting that housing was pulling out of a recent slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Monday that existing-home sales increased 4.9 percent last month to an annual rate of 4.89 million units. The increase was the largest since August 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast that sales would rise 2.2 percent, to a pace of 4.73 million units annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery stalled in the second half of 2013 as interest rates increased and prices rose while the supply of properties for sale dwindled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the second consecutive months of gains, sales were down 5 percent compared with May 2013. They remain down 9 percent from a peak of 5.38 million units, hit in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the increase in sales will be welcomed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, which is closely watching the housing market as it contemplates the future course of monetary policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, has warned that a prolonged slump could undermine the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sturdy housing report added to signs that economic activity had regained momentum after sliding in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed that manufacturing expanded strongly in June. The financial data firm Markit said its preliminary or “flash” manufacturing purchasing managers index for the United States rose to 57.5, the highest reading since May 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index was 56.4 in May, and a reading above 50 signals expansion in economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing is showing tentative signs of recovery, progress will most likely be slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers, a necessary ingredient for a strong housing market, continue to hug the sidelines. Many have also been hampered by financial institutions’ stringent lending practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, first-time buyers accounted for 27 percent of the transactions, hovering near their lowest level since the Realtors group started tracking the series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A market share of 40 to 45 percent for first-time buyers is considered ideal by economists and real estate professionals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of unsold homes on the market increased 6 percent from a year ago to 2.28 million in May. That was the highest level since August 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The month’s supply of existing homes decreased to 5.6 months from 5.7 months in April. Six months’ supply is normally considered a healthy balance between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the improved supply from March is helping to temper price increases. The median home price increased 5.1 percent from a year ago to $213,400. That was the smallest increase since March 2012.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market was essentially unchanged on a quiet Monday as investors found few reasons to keep buying after a six-day rally in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merger activity lifted the energy sector, and homebuilders rose on strong sales data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp;P. 500 dipped 0.26 of a point, or 0.01 percent, to close at 1,962.61.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp;P. 500 is coming off its longest win streak since mid-April, and both it and the <span class="companylink">Dow</span> closed at nominal highs on Friday. While Wall Street’s uptrend is still viewed as intact, investors are looking for catalysts to deliver more robust gains, and recent data has been mixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American economic data was positive on Monday, with existing home sales rising 4.9 percent in May, more than twice the rate of growth that had been expected, while a preliminary reading on June manufacturing rose more than expected to its highest since May 2010, according to Markit, a financial data firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other surveys of manufacturers gave positive signals for the global economic outlook, but dark clouds remained over Europe’s prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Right now we’re digesting last week’s gains and keeping an eye on all the economic data that’s coming out this week,” said Leo P. Grohowski, who oversees more than $184 billion in client assets as chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re not likely to see a major pullback, given healthy activity like buybacks and mergers,” he added, calling Monday “a day of quiet consolidation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp;P. energy sector was the day’s strongest group, gaining 0.4 percent after <span class="companylink">Wisconsin Energy</span> agreed to buy the <span class="companylink">Integrys Energy Group</span> for $5.7 billion in stock and cash[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/wisconsin-energy-to-buy-integrys-for-5-7-billion/].

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PHLX housing sector index rose 0.4 percent after the strong home sales report. <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> shares gained $1.28, or 1.3 percent, to $17.46, while shares of the Pulte Group added 25 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $19.90.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the stocks on the move, Micros Systems rose $2.21, or 3.4 percent, to $67.98, after it agreed to be acquired[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/oracle-to-buy-micros-systems-for-5-3-billion/] by <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> for $5.3 billion. <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> shares rose 28 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $41.10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock in <span class="companylink">ParkerVision</span> plummeted $3.16, or 63.1 percent, to $1.85, in heavy trading after a federal judge overturned a jury verdict that ordered <span class="companylink">Qualcomm</span> to pay <span class="companylink">ParkerVision</span> $173 million for infringing patents. <span class="companylink">Qualcomm</span> shares slipped 43 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $79.43.</p>

The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> says household net worth increased $1.5 trillion in the quarter, to $81.8 trillion.

</div><div class="author">BY FLOYD NORRIS   </div><div>592 words</div><div>31 May 2014</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>11</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s one way to tell that the housing market is beginning to show signs of health: when builders of new homes sell more houses than banks do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States is not there yet, but the gap is narrowing, even as overall home sales slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to calculations by Hanley Wood, a real estate research firm whose Metrostudy division studies deed transfers in about 95 percent of the United States, the areas it covered reported sales of about 74,000 new single-family homes in the first quarter of this year. During the same period, banks sold about twice that number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank sales — known in the industry as real-estate-owned, or R.E.O. — are of homes that were foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgage holder without going through the formal foreclosure process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hanley Wood figures show that in four of the 20 major metropolitan areas it covers — Dallas, Houston, Denver and Washington — home builders are selling more houses than the banks are. As can be seen in the accompanying charts, the volume of new-home sales turned up in 2011 and has been rising gradually since then, though it remains far below the boom levels that existed before the financial crisis. The volume of sales by banks has been declining for more than two years. Nationally, about 8 percent of home sales in the first quarter were made by builders and 17 percent by banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, home sales have slowed in recent months, raising some worries that the rebound in housing might be fading. But Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist at Hanley Wood, said much of that decline was caused by reductions in both foreclosure volume and in sales of homes that banks have acquired through foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The total volumes are not nearly as important as the composition of what is being sold and who is buying,’’ he said. ‘‘You can fret all you want about the total volumes being up or down, but the reality is that the residential real estate market is getting healthier and healthier each month. The health is reflected in the share of nondistressed, normal transactions continuing to rise.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, he said, in many areas more homes are being bought by people who intend to live in them rather than by investors who plan to rent them out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures are based on recorded deeds and thus reflect sales that may have been negotiated in previous months. They do not include transactions in which foreclosures were completed and ownership transferred to banks, but do include the subsequent sale by the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">R.E.O. sales have remained strong in some areas, notably in parts of Florida and in the Detroit area. In the first quarter of this year, banks sold more homes than did home builders and existing homeowners combined in the Detroit area, though that figure was influenced by an unusually large volume of homes sold by banks in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home sales figures reflected in the accompanying charts differ from the sales figures that are most often reported. The Census Bureau estimates new-home sales based on a survey of home builders, and counts them in the month the contract is signed, which could be several months before the sale closes and the deed is transferred. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> estimates the number of sales of existing, or previously owned, homes based on transactions reported by multiple listing services.</p>

</div><div class="author">By SHAILA DEWAN   </div><div>907 words</div><div>29 May 2014</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>15</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A steep gain in home prices in many markets that helped lift millions of Americans out of the red on their mortgages is now markedly slowing, with new data from the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span>/Case-Shiller national home price index showing that the annual growth in prices eased in March to 10.3 percent, from the previous year’s increase of 11.4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But analysts said the softening of price gains, rather than a worrisome trend, might actually be welcome news. Double-digit increases cannot go on forever, and many economists are using words like ‘‘sustainable’’ and ‘‘stable’’ to describe the slowdown, saying the market is becoming healthier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures make up a smaller percentage of sales, and the higher prices have caused investors to back off, leaving the bigger question of whether housing is affordable and mortgages are accessible to average families that want to buy. First-time home buyers still make up less than 30 percent of the market, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, while the number of all-cash buyers — not just investors, but older people who are downsizing after the sale of a larger home — has remained elevated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those factors will help curb any potential new bubbles, said Mark H. Goldman, a real estate expert at San Diego State University. ‘‘Here in San Diego, we have a real shortage of inventory, yet prices are softening,’’ he said, adding that houses in the area may have been priced too aggressively. ‘‘A big factor on home price appreciation is affordability.’’ Prices in San Diego rose 18.9 percent from March 2013 to March 2014, according to Case-Shiller, which released the data on Tuesday. More moderate increases may give buyers’ incomes a chance to catch up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 20 cities that Case-Shiller tracks individually, all had double-digit price increases in that time period except Boston; Charlotte, N.C.; Cleveland; Denver; New York; and Washington, which had single-digit increases. In some cases, the cities hit hardest in the housing bust had the biggest gains. Las Vegas, where home prices rose 21 percent, led the list. Cities where demand has accelerated and housing supply is sharply limited by geography and other factors, like San Francisco, also posted large gains. Prices soared there by 21 percent, according to the measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighteen cities are still below their peak prices during the housing bubble; only two — Denver and Dallas — have returned to the previous levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But analysts say that the prices at the height of a bubble should not be considered a benchmark. Compared with March 2004, a decade ago, home prices in 14 of 20 cities are now higher. That trend was good news for the four million families who regained some equity in their homes last year, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. But for the 6.5 million families who still owe more than their home is worth, many of whom bought or refinanced at the height of the market, the current slowdown is likely to delay the point at which their homes will be above water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-to-month price changes are much more volatile than year-over-year changes, so economists were skeptical when Case-Shiller showed a gain from February to March that was much larger than expected. Nineteen of 20 cities showed higher prices, while prices in New York actually contracted 0.3 percent. ‘‘The Case-Shiller numbers contradict all the other housing market numbers we follow, which show activity and home prices slowing or falling outright since mortgage rates surged last spring,’’ Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, price growth appears to have peaked in several cities, particularly in the South and West, where large inventories of foreclosures have already been absorbed, economists at <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight wrote. They predicted that in response, builders would step up the construction of new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts at Capital Economics also forecast positive effects from the slowdown. ‘‘Slowing house price appreciation should not be seen as a sign that the housing recovery is hitting the buffers. In fact, it will have the opposite effect,’’ they wrote. ‘‘A slowdown in price gains closer to the rate of income growth will prevent housing becoming overvalued, and therefore support a further rise in home sales and housing starts.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home buyers have pulled back sharply from the market since rock-bottom interest rates began to rise about a year ago, even though they remain low by historical standards. In April, the number of sales of existing homes rose for the first time in four months, and the uptick was only modest. The pending home sales index declined for nine months before inching into positive territory in March, the most recent month available. Sales of new homes declined sharply in March, but bounced back in April. On Tuesday, Zillow said mortgage rates had fallen below 4 percent for the first time since last October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing experts emphasize that the biggest drivers of the market are more fundamental than prices, mortgage rates or things like student loan debt, often cited as a reason more young adults are unable to buy for the first time. People buy homes when they have good jobs and rising incomes, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘People can only buy,’’ Mr. Goldman said, ‘‘what they can prove that they can afford.’’</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — New-home sales in the United States recovered in April after slumping the previous two months. But Americans are still buying new homes at a slower pace than they did a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Friday that sales of new homes rose 6.4 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 433,000. That compares with an upwardly revised annual pace of 407,000 in March, when purchases fell 6.9 percent. Buying dropped 4.4 percent in February, in part because of winter snowstorms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for newly built homes remains one of the missing pieces of the nearly five-year-old recovery from the recession. A lack of affordability has limited buying around the country. Sales of new homes are running at roughly half the rate of a healthy real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warmer weather has yet to heat up the housing market after a harsh winter slowed sales in January and February. Higher prices and mortgage rates over the last year have also sidelined many would-be buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales during April surged in the Midwest and edged up in the South. Home-buying was flat in the West and fell in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yelena Shulyatyeva, an economist at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>, noted that the 47.4 percent increase in Midwest sales were probably attributable to the start of the spring buying season and that similar levels of growth were “not likely to continue.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The broader trend remains one of weak underlying demand,” Ms. Shulyatyeva said in a client note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales have declined 4.2 percent over the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price, which can be volatile, fell a slight 2.1 percent during the last month to $275,800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying has been slow across much of the country after climbing in the first half of 2013. Last year’s gains and a limited supply of homes pushed up prices to levels that strained household budgets for potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in April rose 1.3 percent from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.65 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. Purchases of homes over the last 12 months have dropped 6.8 percent. In a healthy housing market, roughly 5.5 million existing homes are purchased each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for an existing home has risen 5.2 percent to $201,700.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales growth over the last year has occurred primarily among homes worth more than $750,000. Buying fell during the same period for homes worth less than $250,000, which make up a majority of all purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the increase in construction has been in the apartment sector, a sign that builders expect fewer buyers and more renters. After the housing crisis and recession, Americans have been coping with flat wages and job insecurity, making it hard to save for a down payment. The homeownership rate was 64.8 percent at the start of the year, down from a peak of 69.2 percent during 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes usually represent about 20 percent of all homes sold. That figure has fallen recently to 10 percent, according to the real estate data firm, Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of builder confidence for this month fell a percentage point to 45, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Homebuilders</span> and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> reported Thursday. A reading below 50 indicates that builders consider the conditions for new construction to be poor. The index had been above 50 from June through January.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index closed at a new nominal high on Friday, buoyed by a rally in housing stocks after better-than-expected home sales and a jump in shares of the personal computer maker <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> a day after it said it would cut more jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp;P. 500 ended at 1,900.53, just below a nominal intraday high of 1,902.17 set on May 13 and above its closing high of 1,897.45 the same day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing stocks ranked among the market’s biggest performers, with the housing index up 1.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big tech names like <span class="companylink">Apple</span> and Amazon lifted the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> and helped it outperform the broader market. <span class="companylink">Apple</span> shares ended up 1.1 percent at $614.13. Amazon shares jumped 2.4 percent to $312.24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> jumped 6.1 percent to $33.72. The stock was among the S.&amp;P. 500’s best performers a day after the personal computer maker said it might cut as many as 16,000 more jobs in effort to turn the company around by Meg Whitman, the company’s chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">CBOE</span> Volatility Index, or VIX, fell 5.6 percent to end at 11.36, its lowest level since March 2013. Known as Wall Street’s fear index, the VIX is extremely low by historical standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The VIX, at those levels, shows investors’ lack of anxiety and “a certain amount of complacency,” said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at <span class="companylink">National Securities</span> in New York. “The lower the VIX, the more overbought the market gets, leaving it vulnerable to some kind of setback.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average rose 63.19 points, or 0.38 percent, to 16,606.27. The S.&amp;P. 500 gained 8.04 points, or 0.42 percent, to end at 1,900.53. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> added 31.47 points, or 0.76 percent, to 4,185.81. For the S.&amp;P. 500, it was the fifth daily advance out of the last six sessions, and its first weekly gain out of the last three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing stocks rallied for a second day after data from the Commerce Department showed sales of new single-family homes rose more than expected[http://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf] in April and the supply of houses on the market hit a three-and-a-half year high. A day ago, another report showed existing-home sales rebounded in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased 6.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 433,000 units, ending two straight months of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, the second-largest homebuilder in the United States in terms of revenue, shot up 4 percent to $40.54. The stock of the top homebuilder, <span class="companylink">D. R. Horton</span>, climbed 4.1 percent to $23.57. In the bond market, interest rates fell slightly. The yield on the Treasury’s 10-year note declined to 2.54 percent, from 2.55 percent on Friday, while its price rose 5/32, to 103 3/32.</p>

<div>The Upshot</div>
<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">How Much Would Home Prices Fall if You Couldn’t Deduct Mortgage Interest?</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, a reader, @SquarelyRooted, [https://twitter.com/squarelyrooted] proposed that we create an alternate-universe version of our rent vs. buy calculator [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?rref=upshot] in which there is no mortgage interest tax deduction. Scaling back the mortgage interest deduction — and its inherent subsidy for owning a home — is a crucial piece of some proposals to overhaul the tax code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, with a minor hack, that capability is built into the calculator already. And it can be an interesting exercise to help understand how the deductibility of mortgage interest affects the economics of homebuying. Just change your marginal tax rate in the calculator to zero, and you’ll get a sense of what the buy vs. rent decision would look like for you if mortgage interest were not deductible. That’s because if you had a zero marginal tax rate, the tax savings from the mortgage interest rate would become zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Say someone is considering a $500,000 home and expecting to live there for seven years. Using all of our default settings for other variables (down payment, mortgage rate, and so on), the equivalent rent would be $1,956, meaning renting may be a bargain if a comparable place rents for less than that, and buying is a bargain if the comparable rent is higher. But if we change the marginal tax rate from 20 percent to zero, we can get a sense of how that would be different in a world without the mortgage interest deduction. The equivalent rental jumps by 19 percent to $2,321.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, for that hypothetical homebuyer, the mortgage interest deduction is worth $365 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that assumes that home prices would be the same as they are now even after the elimination of the deduction. In fact, it is more likely that home prices would fall to reflect the absence of a government subsidy through the tax code. But how much?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get an estimate, we can see how much the price of our $500,000 would have to fall in order for it to have the same equivalent rent in a no-mortgage-deduction world. The new price: $418,000. In other words, you would expect home prices to fall about 16 percent if there were no mortgage interest deduction. That helps explain why homebuilding interests — and many individual homeowners — would fight tooth and nail against any effort to eliminate the mortgage interest deudction.</p>

<div>The Upshot</div>
<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Rent or Buy? The Math Is Changing</span>
</div><div class="author">By NEIL IRWIN </div><div>1422 words</div><div>22 May 2014</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billy Gasparino and Jenna Dillon-Gasparino were savvy enough to wait out the housing boom of a decade ago as renters. Not until 2010, well into the bust, did they buy a house in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles, less than a mile from the beach, for $810,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only four years later, the couple see new signs of excess in the housing market and have decided to go back to renting. They are close to a deal to sell their house – for $1.35 million, a cool 67 percent gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It just seems like the housing market came back so strongly, so fast, that maybe there’s a little bit of a bubble there,” said Mr. Gasparino, 37, an executive with the <span class="companylink">San Diego Padres</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their decision reflects a new reality in many of the nation’s largest metropolitan areas. An analysis by The New York Times finds that in the country’s most expensive places, including New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles, buying a home again looks like a perilous investment, based on the relationship between their prices and rents or incomes. And in a longer list of areas, including Boston, Miami and Washington, prices have risen enough that buying is no longer the bargain it looked to be a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Times also created an online calculator  [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=0]that enables prospective buyers and renters to analyze their own decision. For example, for a typical person considering the purchase of a $500,000 house who expects to live there seven years, it might make more sense to rent if a similar place is available for $1,956 a month or less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of these coastal markets look overvalued compared to rents,” said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> Analytics. “In these markets, it seems generally more attractive to rent than to buy, even as the national market is broadly well balanced.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Venice, where the Gasparinos are selling their house, has benefited from an influx of tech industry, including from the opening of <span class="companylink">Google</span>’s Los Angeles office there in 2011. “You have engineers, visual effects artists, people making 2, 3, 400 thousand dollars a year coming in,” said Tami Pardee, principal of Pardee Properties real estate brokerage in Venice. “The problem I’m having is inventory. There isn’t enough of it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to low interest rates and home prices that remain 13 percent below their 2006 peak nationally, buying continues to look like a good deal in much of the country. In the once-frothy markets of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla., for example, the typical home price is still 30 to 40 percent below 2006 levels, even more if one accounts for inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But across much of California and the Northeast, prices are now high enough that the costs of owning a home – property taxes, repairs, fees to real-estate agents and mortgage interest – may outweigh the financial benefits, including the tax break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the latest change in a yo-yo pattern over the past decade. From 2004 to 2006, the math overwhelmingly favored renting rather than buying across most of the country, even as many Americans mistakenly decided that home prices could never fall. From 2009 to 2011, buying was an extraordinary deal in most of the country. Even the markets that have experienced huge price increases are far from the clear-cut bubble conditions of the mid-2000s, but they’re inching closer with every bidding war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the start of 2011, prices have risen 33 percent in the San Francisco area, 30 percent in Miami, 24 percent in Los Angeles — and even more in some of the most desirable neighborhoods within those areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the San Francisco Bay Area, home of the sharpest recent price increases, the sale price of a home is about 20 times what it would cost to rent a home of the same size for a year. That ratio, based on an analysis of data from Zillow, is the same as in 2003, when the San Francisco real estate market had yet to become an out-of-control bubble but was well on its way there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When low mortgage rates are taken into account, buying a home in San Francisco looks somewhat more attractive — but with a 10 percent down payment and prevailing interest rates, buying a home is 6 percent more expensive than renting a place of the same size, the same premium for buying as there was during the dot-com boom in 1999. Just two years ago, buying in the San Francisco area was 24 percent cheaper than renting an equivalent place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The potentially overvalued markets are the result of three forces. They are taking place in local economies that suffered only minimally during the recession that began in 2008 and have experienced strong job growth since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are fueled further by the low-interest rate policies that are aimed at bolstering the overall national economy but don’t discriminate based on geography. Even as San Francisco’s housing market is at risk of overheating, buyers there get the same ultralow mortgage rates engineered by the Federal Reserve as home buyers in depressed Detroit or Cleveland do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the new booms are taking place in markets where restrictions on building hinder developers from responding to rising demand by constructing more housing. That distinguishes the major California markets from the strong local economies in Texas and elsewhere. The Dallas area and the San Francisco area added similar numbers of jobs last year, but local governments in Dallas issued permits for nearly four times as many new housing units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are important caveats, of course. The wisdom of buying versus renting depends heavily on each person’s financial situation, plans and preferences. And the cliché about all real estate being local holds; each neighborhood can have its own unique dynamics in the for-sale and for-rent housing sectors that must be considered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers in even the highest-price markets can take some solace in the fact that prices aren’t as outlandishly high relative to rents as they were in 2006. But they should also know that homes are also priced richly enough to leave no room for error.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s a bit like the current consensus opinion of economists on the value of the stock market: not in a bubble, necessarily, but certainly expensive enough to make a buyer wary. While home prices may stay high for months or years to come, buyers are leaving themselves vulnerable to a decline toward more normal historical valuations. Renters avoid that risk, even if they also don’t get some of the upside if the bull market for houses in places like Santa Monica, Nob Hill and TriBeCa has longer to run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you thought home values in the Bay Area or Southern California were such that we might see another housing correction, that radically starts to advantage rental housing,” said Stan Humphries, Zillow’s chief economist, who argues that current prices are reasonably well justified, while acknowledging that prices are high enough to leave buyers exposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market in Venice, where the Gasparinos are selling their house to lock in the gains, shows the forces shaping the new boom markets. Besides the tech employment there on Silicon Beach, as the local boosters put it, the supply of housing can’t expand to meet that rising demand. The area is filled with block after block of low-slung houses and apartments, and density restrictions stand in the way of constructing tall buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That combination has been enough to send the median price per square foot of homes that are sold up 49 percent since late 2010 in the 90291 ZIP code, according to Zillow, and the median rent per square foot up 23 percent in the same span.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When we bought four years ago after the crash, the market was dead, and it felt like everybody learned their lesson,” Mr. Gasparino said. “It just went back so fast.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- After almost two decades of nearly unceasing increases in real estate prices and construction across China, one of the world's longest-running bull markets finally seems to be stalling, with broad consequences for the country's economy and possibly its politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are falling for both new and old apartments. The volume of deals is drying up. And developers are pulling back, furloughing workers and delaying new projects. In the latest sign, housing starts plummeted 25 percent in April from a year ago, the Chinese government announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a severe blow for a country where real estate sales offices have become ubiquitous and tower cranes are jokingly described as the national bird.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Su Hua, a real estate broker in Shenzhen, had his highest commissions ever last year, as a speculative frenzy prompted families all over China to buy and sell apartments at a brisk pace. But he sat in a deserted office late last week with several silent phones on his desk. His income has halved so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is how much further the real estate market will slow, and whether its troubles will spill into other sectors of the economy, notably the banking system. Any weakness in the great Chinese economic engine could reverberate through the global markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't predict how the bursting of a Chinese real estate bubble plays out because it plays out in very small steps,'' said Joel H. Rothstein, a partner in the Beijing office of the Paul Hastings law firm who specializes in Asian real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's real estate market correction -- some economists are even calling it the popping of a bubble -- is partly the result of a deliberate decision by the country's leaders in Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve and other regulators in the United States did not try to deflate what now seems to have been an American housing bubble in the years leading up to the 2008 downturn. But the Chinese leadership has been increasingly concerned over the last several years that housing prices were rising to unaffordable levels and that the economy was becoming overly dependent on investment; residential construction accounts for one-ninth of all economic output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result has been a series of policies that includes punitive interest rates for mortgages on second homes, a ban on the purchase of third homes and, more recently, deliberate action by the central bank to keep short-term interest rates well above the rate of inflation. Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, the <span class="companylink">People's Bank of China</span>, reaffirmed tight credit policies on Saturday, saying that he did not think the economy was in sufficient trouble to justify monetary policy stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the real estate market continues to slump, which could prompt Beijing to take a different tack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic data released on Tuesday also included a deceleration in industrial production, with growth in steel and cement output slowing to a crawl. Retail sales also grew more slowly than expected in April, and the furniture market stalled as fewer families moved into new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Centaline, one of China's largest real estate brokerage firms, transactions over the May 1 holiday weekend fell by half in Beijing and Shanghai from a year ago. The weekend is traditionally one of the two biggest real estate buying times of the year, along with a weeklong national holiday at the start of October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Su, the real estate broker, worries that the market tumult shows no sign of ending. ''There is not much else I know how to do,'' Mr. Su said. ''Maybe I will consider selling insurance on the side, if business continues to slow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of real estate restrictions are already being rescinded. In the last two weeks, state-controlled banks in Shenzhen, adjacent to Hong Kong, have stopped charging the extra half percentage point to one percentage point above the regulated national benchmark rate for mortgages. They had been charging extra in recent years, in an effort to discourage excess in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some experts wonder whether wealthy families will want to jump back into the market even if the most important restrictions, on the purchase of multiple apartments, are lifted. Nicole Wong, the head of property research at CLSA, a Hong Kong-based brokerage and investment firm, said that easing limits on overseas investment meant that more wealthy families were starting to send their money to Hong Kong and elsewhere instead of buying more apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For real estate prices, ''even if you relax all the restrictions, it won't make much of a difference,'' she said. ''The one thing that is certain is the direction is set, and it is down -- but it can be managed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese banking executives and economists say that a severe housing downturn would most likely cause a considerable increase in nonperforming loans at the country's banks. But they make several arguments for why even a fairly steep slump in housing might not lead to the bank failures or emergency bailouts seen in the United States when its market soured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major reason is that a significant drop in the housing market would still leave the prices of most homes higher than the balance on the mortgages. So almost nobody expects a big wave of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of the homes in China were bought more than five years ago, and real estate prices have about doubled in the last five years. Down payments range from 20 to 40 percent and are often higher, giving banks a larger cushion against any losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bigger worry is the extent to which companies in other sectors have borrowed money from banks and trusts that they were supposed to invest in equipment purchases and other business activities, but have secretly speculated in real estate instead. Extensive anecdotal evidence suggests that such speculative activity by companies has been widespread.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sectors of the Chinese economy are healthier than residential real estate, and could help sustain economic output. Infrastructure spending by the government, particularly railroad construction, is moving into high gear. And the central bank has gradually pushed down the renminbi against the dollar in currency markets this year, helping the competitiveness of Chinese goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the trouble in the housing market has serious implications for consumers. A national survey released in March by the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu, China, found that households across the country had 66 percent of their assets in their homes, a figure that rises to 84 percent in Beijing. The comparable figure for the United States, where stocks and bonds are more popular, is 41 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so much wealth tied up in housing, concerns are rising about the potential for protests and other turbulence if real estate prices keep falling. A new crop of discounts adds to the nervousness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government and private sector statistics for real estate prices are inconsistent and hard to compare. But discounts of 10 to 20 percent from a year ago are increasingly common for homes sold between individuals, and for new units sold by developers as well, real estate executives said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chairman of a large developer with operations across China said that offering price discounts for the remaining units in half-sold projects was extremely difficult, because earlier buyers could protest and demand refunds equal to the discounts. The potential for protests, and not banking sector exposure to real estate, ''is what concerns me,'' said the developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Winnie Y. Cheng, the research director at Centaline, said that many developers could not afford to hold apartments off the market indefinitely and were already cutting prices. Street protests have occurred, notably in Hangzhou, although earlier buyers have mostly accepted the discounts for later buyers, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, she added, ''All of the developments are willing to cut their price.''</p>

<div>The Upshot</div>
<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Everyone Wants to Be a Homeowner. Why Not a Foodowner?</span>
</div><div class="author">By JOSH BARRO   </div><div>608 words</div><div>6 May 2014</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine if we bought food the way we buy housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of buying the food you need right now, you would buy a contract giving you rights to a stream of food in perpetuity. Say, a contract entitling you to five pounds of chicken breasts, delivered to you every week, forever. That’s basically what buying a home is: securing the use of a residence, indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying that stream of future food would be expensive, so you’d get a loan from a bank to cover most of the cost, secured by your interest in those future chicken breasts. And if for some reason you didn’t need your chicken contract anymore (you became a vegetarian or you moved out of the delivery range of your chicken supplier), you could sell the contract at the current market price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this system, perverse things would begin to happen. Normally, consumers prefer that food prices be low. But this practice would create a large constituency of foodowners, who would benefit from rising food prices: If you bought your chicken contract for $20,000, and rising chicken prices pushed its value to $40,000, you’d have a nice windfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foodowners would eagerly support government policies that restrict the production of food because that would push up prices. And they might reap windfalls from rising prices without selling their contracts: They could refinance, cashing out the equity in their appreciated food contracts to spend on caviar and crême brùlée contracts, or on nonfood items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People might start buying contracts on food they don’t even want to eat in hopes of selling later at a profit. That might lead to a food bubble. And if food prices crashed, a lot of highly leveraged foodowners would end up in bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would all be pretty stupid. But it would all seem perfectly normal, as it very closely mirrors the way we approach housing. Housing exists so people can use it. But because housing consumers tend to take long-range equity interests in housing, they come to view housing as an investment, which distorts the housing market in the directions of restricted supply, inflated prices and speculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And because home equity is often the dominant form of investment for a middle-class family, people bet their economic fortunes on the residential real estate market where they live, rather than making the less volatile bet on the overall condition of the economy that comes from a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might object that home prices are not more volatile than the stock market. But the relevant issue here is the equity in a home with a mortgage on it; a 20 percent decline in home prices may wipe out the equity interest entirely, making it a riskier bet than buying stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting on your local real estate market isn’t all that different from betting on the price of chicken, which is why I got on my soapbox recently on MSNBC[http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/watch/why-homeownership-isnt-key-to-american-dream-242205763830] to urge people to rent their homes, and start viewing housing as a consumption good, like food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I will grant that there are some advantages of homeownership. Owning offers people a sense of security, as well as the freedom to customize their residences as they see fit. Those are perfectly good reasons to buy a home as a consumption good; it is not a justification for homes (or chicken breasts) as investments.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/upshot/the-housing-market-is-still-holding-back-the-economy-heres-why.html] we explored the fact that housing remains one of the major weak spots in the economy, with building activity far below its longer-term averages. Economic commentators around the Web had a range of reactions; here are some of the more interesting ones and a few thoughts on the critiques of our article [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/upshot/the-housing-market-is-still-holding-back-the-economy-heres-why.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Vox, Matthew Yglesias argues [http://www.vox.com/2014/4/25/5650816/nimbys-are-killing-the-national-economy] that an important piece of the puzzle is the restrictions that many high-income localities place on new housing construction. The intuition is straightforward: In some of the markets where demand is highest — as evidenced by rapid price increases and strong local job growth — the supply of housing can’t keep up because zoning restrictions prevent builders from putting up new housing at all, or require that they do so at much lower density than market forces would suggest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Opening up the spigots of development in high-priced, high-demand areas could … create a ton of new jobs in the construction sector and related fields. But most the areas of the country where housing demand is strongest are generally the areas most politically dominated by left-wing people who are reluctant to embrace a deregulatory agenda,” Mr. Yglesias writes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s a lot to his argument, and work by Mr. Yglesias, Ryan Avent and others over the last few years has convinced me that zoning restrictions and insufficient density in major cities really are inhibiting economic growth. But does it answer the immediate question of why housing hasn’t rebounded to its historical norm as a proportion of the economy? Yes, San Francisco and Washington and Boston restrict developers’ ability to put up tall buildings that lots of people might live in, but it’s not evident that they are more restrictive today than they were in the 1990s, when national building activity was much higher relative to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barry Ritholtz [http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/]at Bloomberg View [http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-04-25/where-are-all-the-homebuyers] adds two more potential factors on why buyers aren’t showing up. One is simple psychology: Mr. Ritholtz argues that the housing crash of 2006 to 2010 was so deep that it scarred potential buyers, leaving them convinced housing was fundamentally risky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second argument from Mr. Ritholtz is more subtle: The number of homeowners with low or even negative equity in their houses is significant enough to gum up the normal ebb and flow of the housing market. When people owe more on a house than they can sell it for, the normal churn in the market dries up. Mr. Ritholtz argues:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When you consider the chain of purchasers that typically occurs in a residential real estate market, you will understand why homeowner equity is so important. Any home sale is usually part of a series of interdependent transactions. The newlyweds who buy a starter home are usually doing so from a married couple, who have a 3-year-old and another on the way. They want to buy a larger home with more bedrooms for the kids, and purchase that from the couple who are trading up to a nicer home in a better school district. Those sellers purchase their new home on more land, or with a better view or some other factor. The long chain of buyers and sellers, beginning with the first-time buyers, explains why household formation is so crucial.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And at the House Of Debt blog, [http://houseofdebt.org/2014/04/24/housing-wont-save-the-u-s-economy.html] Atif Mian and Amir Sufi address an area that the article didn’t cover in any depth, which is the interplay between higher home prices and overall economic activity. Essentially, they conclude that, whereas a decade ago rising home prices created spillover effects that supported overall growth — including more building activity and home equity borrowing — that relationship has broken down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The sensitivity of economic activity to rising house prices is much lower today than it was prior to the Great Recession,” write Mr. Mian and Mr. Sufi, academics who have done groundbreaking work on the relationship between debt and economic growth. “This is due to a number of factors, such as the rise in investor purchases and the fact that the households who would be most likely to spend out of housing wealth are no longer homeowners.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is certainly consistent with the odd pattern that has been displayed in the last couple of years, in which home prices increases haven’t translated into major gains in building activity or consumer spending. The next assignment desk challenge for Mr. Mian and Mr. Sufi: to figure out what will ultimately cause a change in the pattern — or whether it’s something we should get used to living with for some time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American consumer confidence dipped in April but remained near a six-year high, while home prices rose in February, suggesting that the economy continued to regain momentum after a winter lull.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 82.3, the second-highest reading since January 2008, from an upwardly revised 83.9 in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unusually cold and snowy winter disrupted economic activity early in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While sentiment regarding current conditions may have slipped a bit, consumers do not foresee the economy, or the labor market, losing the momentum that has been building up over the past several months,'' Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 0.8 percent in February on a seasonally adjusted basis, beating the expectation for a 0.7 percent gain according to a Reuters survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly price increase mirrored the one in January. Prices were up 12.9 percent from a year ago, compared with a year-on-year gain of 13.2 percent in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise, however, failed to offset other recent data pointing to a loss of momentum in housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Despite continued price gains, most other housing statistics are weak,'' said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Dow Jones Indices, who cited sales data on existing homes and new homes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market took a bit of a roller-coaster ride on Monday, but it managed to end mostly higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders were pulled in multiple directions. Stocks rallied at the opening, fell in the afternoon, then mostly rose again in the last hour of trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank stocks fell after <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> said a financial error would force it to cancel its stock buyback plan and dividend increase, while health care stocks rose after <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> renewed its pursuit of a merger with <span class="companylink">AstraZeneca</span> of Britain. Formerly high-flying technology stocks fell again, dragging the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite index into the red.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index rose 6.03 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 1,869.43. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 87.28 points, or 0.5 percent, to 16,448.74. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> dipped 1.16 points, or 0.03 percent, to 4,074.40, although the index erased most of a 61-point loss earlier in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> sank $1, or 6.3 percent, to $14.95 after it unexpectedly announced it would suspend its stock buyback program and dividend increase. The bank discovered an error in how it calculates its capital ratio, a crucial measure of its strength. The Federal Reserve asked the bank to delay its buyback and dividend increase until the error was fixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> each fell 1 percent after <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-flying technology stocks were another area of weakness on Monday as investors continued to cut their exposure to high-growth names and turned their focus to larger dividend-paying companies. Amazon fell $7.25, or 2.4 percent, to $296.58 after plunging nearly 10 percent on Friday after reporting its financials. Netflix lost $7.87, or 2.4 percent, to $314.21 and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> fell $1.57, or 2.7 percent, to $56.14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, ''old'' technology companies like <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, Apple and I.B.M., which have more mature businesses and pay quarterly dividends, rose nearly 2 percent or more on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-growth technology and biotechnology stocks have been falling for several weeks now. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> is down 3 percent so far in April, while the S.&amp;P. 500 and Dow are roughly flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders say the selling has been coming from large investors, who have been moving out of high-growth stocks and into safer investments. The Russell 2000, an index made up mostly of smaller companies, is down 4.8 percent so far this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you have so many investors doing the same thing at the same time, you get these exaggerated moves in some of these stocks,'' said Ian Winer, director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health care stocks did well after <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> renewed its push to buy <span class="companylink">AstraZeneca</span> of Britain for $100 billion. A deal, if it happens, would be the latest big merger in the drug industry in recent weeks. <span class="companylink">AstraZeneca</span> shares rose $8.35, or 12 percent, to $77.01. <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> shares rose $1.29, or 4.2 percent, to $32.04.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In economic news, more Americans signed contracts to buy homes in March, the first increase since June and a sign that the housing market might pick up after a sluggish start to the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Monday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index rose 3.4 percent to 97.4 last month. Still, the index remains 7.9 percent below its level a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gain partly reflects a recovery from the harsh winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the bond market, interest rates moved higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.71 percent, from 2.67 percent late Friday, while its price declined 12/32, to 100 12/32.</p>

</div><div class="author">By MATTHEW GOLDSTEIN   </div><div>1328 words</div><div>29 April 2014</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>18</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Wall Street executive who helped <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> make more than a billion dollars betting against mortgages now wants to buy up troubled home loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald R. Mullen Jr., who was the architect of Goldman’s trade against the housing market just before the financial crisis, is seeking to raise as much as $1 billion for a new fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last two years, the investment firm he founded, Pretium Partners, has bought more than 8,000 single-family homes, which it rents out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the firm plans to use the new fund to buy distressed mortgages at a discount and rework them to permit the borrowers to remain in their homes or, if that fails, foreclose on the properties and operate them as rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That shift in strategy is a sign that some institutional investors — private equity firms, hedge funds and firms like <span class="companylink">Pretium</span> — that started buying foreclosed homes after the financial crisis are now scaling back the pace of their purchases. These firms are looking for other ways to make money from the wreckage of the housing bust and generate higher than normal returns for their wealthy investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in such institutional buying reflects a rise in home prices in places like Las Vegas, Phoenix and Southern California that were hit hard by the financial crisis. It also reflects a dwindling supply of distressed homes being sold at auction by banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RealtyTrac, a firm that monitors housing sales and foreclosures, reports that in February, institutional investors accounted for 5.9 percent of single-family home purchases in the United States, down from 8.22 percent in January 2013, when institutional buying of homes was at its most feverish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, the private equity and investment company that has bought 44,000 foreclosed homes since 2012 — more than any other institutional buyer — sharply scaled back its purchases. Today, the company is spending from $35 million to $40 million a week to buy homes, a considerable sum, but down from the $140 million a week it was spending last summer, a person briefed on <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>’s strategy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>’s Invitation Homes subsidiary, which renovates and rents out the properties, once bought homes in more than a dozen cities but is making most of its acquisitions now in just a handful of places like the Florida cities of Miami and Orlando, and in Seattle, said the person, who spoke on the condition on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the places where <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>, Pretium Partners and others once bought homes at a rapid clip was Las Vegas, but the institutional investors have become victims of their own success in snapping up distressed homes there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Las Vegas have risen about 24 percent over the last year, compared with the national average of 10 percent, according to the online real estate service <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. The median sale price for the average home in Las Vegas now stands at $195,000, according to the <span class="companylink">Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors</span>. That is up from $118,000 when home prices in Las Vegas bottomed out in January 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So institutional home buyers like <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> and Mr. Mullen’s firm, which used to be known as Fundamental REO, are becoming much more selective about where they buy homes and how fast they deploy money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In focusing on nonperforming mortgages, Mr. Mullen, 55, who declined to be interviewed, is going back to his bread-and-butter business, which made him extremely wealthy at Goldman and before that at <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span>, Salomon Brothers and Drexel Burnham Lambert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before leaving Goldman in February 2012, Mr. Mullen was the head of the firm’s credit and mortgage business and a member of its management committee. He oversaw the Goldman team that helped design a trading strategy that enabled the firm and its clients to bet against the mortgage market during the housing bubble. Those trades, based on the belief that banks were selling too many subprime mortgages to borrowers who lacked the financial means to withstand a sharp decline in home prices, ultimately paid off handsomely for Goldman and some of its hedge fund customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a 2007 email that Mr. Mullen sent to some of his colleagues at Goldman, which surfaced during congressional hearings into the financial crisis, he said that the company stood to make ‘‘some serious money’’ from the housing market’s collapse. The so-called subprime trading engineered by Goldman and others on Wall Street was popularized by Michael Lewis in his 2010 book, ‘‘The Big Short.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Mr. Mullen’s new firm, <span class="companylink">Pretium</span>, the Goldman connection remains strong. A 45-page marketing document shows that the <span class="companylink">Pretium</span> fund expects to raise as much as half of its money to spend on mortgages from wealthy customers of Goldman’s asset management division. Goldman is marketing the mortgage fund to its customers just as it did for Mr. Mullen’s foreclosed-home fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His firm sees an opportunity in buying troubled mortgages from government-sponsored mortgage companies like <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, a division of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last three years, the F.H.A. has sold roughly 73,000 mortgages to private investors in a series of auctions. The loans have been sold at an average price of 62 percent of the estimated market value of the homes, according to a RealtyTrac analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The steep discount offered by the federal government is one reason institutional investors are gravitating to troubled mortgages from foreclosed homes. But one distressed-mortgage buyer said the discount to the value of the home had narrowed as the housing market rebounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Pretium</span>’s main strategy in buying nonperforming loans will be to find ways to revamp them, often by reducing the total amount owed, to make the mortgages more affordable to the borrower. But if that cannot be accomplished, the firm will look to foreclose and convert homes to rental properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Goldman marketing document for Mr. Mullen’s fund, a copy of which was shared with Goldman’s wealthy customers, said the firm ‘‘has access to a broad loss-mitigation tool kit to repair defaulted loans and extract value.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for <span class="companylink">Pretium</span>, declined to comment on the new fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mullen and his shop are moving into an already crowded field. A number of hedge funds and investment firms have been buying distressed mortgages from United States banks looking to get troubled assets off their balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the biggest buyers of nonperforming mortgages have been firms that specialize in investing in distressed properties and troubled assets — Oaktree Capital Management and Angelo, Gordon, as well as another <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> subsidiary, Bayview Asset Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another firm that jumped into the market for nonperforming loans is Selene Investment Partners, a firm founded by Lewis S. Ranieri, who helped give birth to the mortgage-backed securities market when he worked at Salomon Brothers in the 1980s. Selene started its first mortgage fund in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of delinquent home loans peaked at 7.6 million at the end of 2009, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>. Today, the number of mortgages in which borrowers have fallen behind on their payments is about 4.4 million. That is a big improvement, but the 6.39 percent of homeowners today who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments remains above the average historical delinquency rate of 5 percent, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘My sense is the market is less attractive than it was a year ago, but you can still find smaller-scale opportunities to make above-normal returns,’’ said Gyan Sinha, a partner with KLS Diversified, a $2.5 billion fixed-income hedge fund that invests in mortgage-backed securities.</p>

</div><div class="author">By NEIL IRWIN </div><div>1631 words</div><div>28 April 2014</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>12</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the economy still feels stuck, blame the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may not match how people in a handful of big, prosperous cities see things. After a disastrous and historic crash, housing is booming in places like San Francisco and New York. Bidding wars are back, and the question is not whether the real estate market is recovering but whether new bubbles are inflating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there’s another reality that is more important for the national economy. Except in a few booming markets, housing is nowhere close to pulling its economic weight. Consider this:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment in residential property remains a smaller share of the overall economy than at any time since World War II, contributing less to growth than it did even in previous steep downturns in the early 1980s, when mortgage rates hit 20 percent, or the early 1990s, when hundreds of mortgage lenders failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If building activity returned merely to its postwar average proportion of the economy, growth would jump this year to a booming, 1990s-like level of 4 percent, from today’s mediocre 2-plus percent. The additional building, renovating and selling of homes would add about 1.5 million jobs and knock about a percentage point off the unemployment rate, now 6.7 percent. That activity would close nearly 40 percent of the gap between America’s current weak economic state and full economic health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what is holding housing back?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, a glut of housing was built during the last great mania, and in some markets buyers are still working through those supplies. Bank lending is only now thawing, for both homebuilders and buyers. But those restraining factors have eased a lot in the last few years. The bigger thing holding back housing is simply demand. Fewer people can or want to fulfill the American dream of starting households of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market in Roanoke, Va., is a good place to see what’s happening. A city of just under 100,000 people in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Roanoke has a history as a rail and manufacturing hub and nowadays has a strong health care industry. It also has this distinction: Its housing market — based on measures like housing prices and building activity — closely matches the nationwide data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new houses and apartments that are needed in the United States is determined over the long term largely by demographics — immigrants arriving and young people moving away from home. From 2000 to 2007, the number of households rose 1.24 million a year on average — about what economists would expect, given those demographic trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add in the 300,000 or so homes that fall into disrepair each year and need to be replaced, and builders would have to construct around 1.5 million homes a year to keep up with the longer-term demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom, builders were much busier than that, putting up 2.1 million more houses from 2000 to 2006 than if they had stuck to that 1.5 million trend rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the correction underway since the housing bubble burst has been far more severe than the overbuilding that preceded it. From 2007 to 2013, builders constructed 4.8 million fewer homes than they would have, had they kept to the trend rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘We built a heck of a lot of homes during the last housing bubble,’’ said Stan Humphries, chief economist of the real estate company Zillow. ‘‘And it’s taken some time to work off that glut.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roanoke never experienced the sort of extreme bubble in prices and construction of a Phoenix or a Miami, or the structural economic decline of the industrial Midwest, or the kind of humming regional economy that spurred a speedy rebound in the likes of San Francisco and Washington. In that sense, Roanoke is like hundreds of midsize cities nationwide that are trying to climb out of a long, deep downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2005, builders in the Roanoke metropolitan area took out permits for more than 1,600 new housing units. At the low point, in 2009, they took out just 449. The rebound since then has been modest, with only 656 permits issued in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Fields, the president of Fields Construction, was responsible for more than a few of those 1,600 homes started in 2005. That year, he began work on a 100-house subdivision called North Oaks, in neighboring Salem, Va. Just as the empty streets of North Oaks started filling in with new houses that were to be priced at approximately $300,000, the housing bust hit and demand collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘A lot of builders just quit building,’’ Mr. Fields said. ‘‘They parked their trucks and decided to do something else.’’ Banks stopped lending for new development. Nearby subdivisions that had been in the planning stages remained only blueprints. Houses that had been started before the bust sat empty, waiting for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, though, those houses have owners, and new houses are rising. But things aren’t good enough to lead a builder like Mr. Fields to crank up the pace of production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fields said that he wanted no more than three houses in inventory at any given time, to avoid the risk of being stuck with empty houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is keeping Peter Fields from building more houses isn’t too much competition from foreclosures or excess houses from the boom years (inventories are fairly tight by historical standards) or a shortage of land (he has 30 more lots graded and ready to build upon) or a shortage of capital (his bankers are eager for him to continue building). It’s simple as can be: ‘‘We’ll build more houses as soon as we see some people ready to buy them,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mystery of the missing buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given demographic trends, there should be plenty of housing demand. Immigration has slowed in recent years, but the nation’s population has still grown by about 20 million since the housing downturn began in 2006. Yet those additional people are translating into fewer new households than historical patterns would predict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a problem for the whole economy, and at its core is the mystery of the missing buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Household formation,’’ as economists call it, is the foundation of demand in the housing market. When a young adult moves away from home and gets her own apartment, a household is formed; when a retiree moves out of his own place and into the apartment above an adult child’s garage, one ceases to exist. The number of American households is in constant motion; it is determined by millions of individual decisions that Americans make about their living situations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2007, those decisions have tilted overwhelmingly toward not dividing up into as many households as in the past. The number of households rose by an average of 569,000 a year from 2007 to 2013, according to census data, down from 1.35 million a year from 2001 to 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using different data sources, Jed Kolko, chief economist at the real estate information company <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, estimates that by last year there were 2.3 million of these ‘‘missing’’ households — households that would exist if historical patterns had held.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why the missing households? To a large degree, they can be explained by young people who choose — or are forced by circumstance — to remain at home longer than previous generations did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the recession, 27 percent of 18-to-34-year-olds lived with their parents. Now that share is 31 percent. That is surely attributable in part to the lingering effects of a downturn that struck young adults particularly hard. Only 62.9 percent of 20- to-24-year-olds had jobs in March, according to Labor Department data, down about 7 percentage points from the spring of 2007. The overall employment rate has fallen by only 4.4 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the weak job market for young adults is an important element of the story, it’s not the only one. Even young people who have jobs are more often living with their parents: Among employed 25- to-34-year-olds, the rate has risen to 25 percent in 2013 from 22 percent in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reed Bergloff, 28, is a Roanoke resident with a solid job selling windows and doors. He lives at his parents’ house, he said, not because of the cost of a rental but because he wants to save money to buy his own place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For other young people, there are different explanations: They may sense that their jobs are not secure, or they have a lot of student debt. Whatever the cause, the effect is to delay signing a lease or getting a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A vicious cycle</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States economy has been stuck in a vicious cycle: A moribund housing market saps the economy of strength, and the ensuing weakness — high unemployment, slow wage growth — means that fewer people are leaving the nest for a home of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How to get out of the cycle? Through a grinding, gradual process in which the 2.3 million missing households start looking for their own places, which generates more building activity, which strengthens the economy and results in more jobs and higher wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of that, however, can happen instantly through some policy change, like a tweak in federal housing rules to make it easier to get a loan, or further measures from the Federal Reserve to lower mortgage rates. More than anything, it takes time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andy Kelderhouse, a potential home buyer, says that 2017 ‘‘is the year everybody throws out as when we’re back to normal. He adds, ‘‘That still seems believable to me.’’</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of new single-family homes tumbled in March to their lowest level in eight months, a setback to the housing market recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that sales dropped 14.5 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 384,000 units, declining for a second consecutive month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new-home sales for last month at 450,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with March 2013, sales were down 13.3 percent, the largest such decline since April 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been hurt by an unusually cold and snowy winter, higher mortgage interest rates and a shortage of properties that is limiting options for potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices, which have increased more than wages, are also weighing on the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales plunged in the Midwest and South. They also fell in the West, but rose in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although sales of new homes are volatile month-on-month and account for less than 10 percent of the overall market, the drop last month confirmed that housing would again be a drag on gross domestic product in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes are counted when contracts are signed. Last month's decline could still reflect some of the impact from the cold weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report on Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for home loans fell last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing is struggling, other sectors of the economy, like manufacturing, are regaining momentum as the weather improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, Markit, the financial data company, said its preliminary manufacturing purchasing managers index for the United States was little changed in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey's measure of output, however, hit its highest level since March 2011, while new orders increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With manufacturing acting as a good bellwether of the rest of the economy, the survey bodes well for further robust economic growth in the second quarter,'' said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.</p>

</div><div class="author">By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   </div><div>561 words</div><div>23 April 2014</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Sales of existing homes in the United States slipped in March to their lowest since July 2012, as rising prices and a tight supply of available homes discouraged many would-be buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Tuesday that sales edged down 0.2 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.59 million. It was the seventh drop in the last eight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose in the Northeast and Midwest, suggesting that winter weather did not weigh as heavily on sales as in previous months. The cold and snowstorms had contributed to lower sales in January and February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sales appear to be stabilizing following earlier weather-related disruptions,” Joseph A. LaVorgna, an economist at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, said in a note to clients. “We expect sales to improve as we enter the crux of the spring selling season.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. LaVorgna noted that the Realtors group reported more buyer traffic at open houses last month, suggesting that demand was rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, big price increases in the past year, along with higher mortgage rates, have made it harder for many Americans to afford a home. Pay increases have not kept up with the higher buying costs. Those trends and harsh weather have dragged down sales since last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For March, sales fell in the West and South, where prices have risen the most in the past year. Price increases were smaller in the Northeast and Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the median sales price last month was $198,500, up 7.9 percent from 12 months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharpest sales increase occurred among homes priced at $1 million or above. Purchases rose 8 percent in that category. Sales fell in nearly every other price group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other measures of home prices have shown stronger gains. <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real estate data provider, says prices rose 12.2 percent in the past year. That might be discouraging some potential investors, who accounted for just 17 percent of home sales in March, the lowest proportion since August. That figure was down from 21 percent in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a positive sign, first-time buyers made up 30 percent of home sales in March, the highest proportion in a year. That is still below the roughly 40 percent that is consistent with a healthy housing market. First-timers have struggled to save for down payments and also face tight credit standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes rose steadily in the first half of last year, reaching an annual pace of 5.38 million in July. But sales slowed in the fall as rising mortgage rates and higher prices began to squeeze some buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 5.1 million homes changed hands last year, the most in seven years. But that is still below the 5.5 million that reflect a healthy market. Many economists expect sales to rise modestly this year but to remain below 5.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are rising even as sales slow, a sign that the supply of available homes is tight, forcing potential buyers to make higher bids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were nearly two million homes for sale at the end of March. But at the current sales pace, that is enough to last only 5.2 months, below the six months’ supply that is considered normal.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ROSS RAMSEY   </div><div>747 words</div><div>13 April 2014</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some in Texas politics would like to abolish property taxes, there are constant efforts to overhaul them, like the percolating attempt to raise valuations of supposedly undervalued business properties in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not a new idea, but there is a new push for higher appraised values on commercial and industrial property. Previous protests along these lines have focused on fairness — on whether homeowners are getting the same deals that commercial owners are getting from local appraisal agencies. The latest effort, called “Real Values for Texas,” seems aimed more at putting money into schools and other government programs that depend on property tax revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complainers have friends in high places, like Mayor Annise Parker of Houston, who has said the State Legislature should change a system that “is obviously inequitable and rewards a lack of transparency by the owners of many commercial properties.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If those commercial values were “corrected” in the way that the group contends they should be, it would add $4.4 billion in revenue to school districts, counties, special districts and cities in the state’s five biggest counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should that argument prevail, it would probably start another one. If the property tax base balloons with new commercial property value, you might think that would bring in more taxes. It would, but only if the various school boards, county commissions and so on left their property tax rates alone. It is those rates, multiplied by those values, that produce tax revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the values go up, they could bring in more money by leaving rates unchanged, lower tax rates to keep revenue unchanged or do something in between.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not one issue, but two. The first is about whether the property tax is fair, treating residential, commercial and industrial property owners the same way. The second is about how much each government needs and wants to spend, and whether each can extract the money it wants from property owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial property owners are more likely to hire lawyers to argue with tax officials about property values. And commercial property owners can sometimes make arguments that the residential property owners cannot. Houses are almost always valued on the basis of sales price. In states where sales prices are kept in public records, it is easier, but even in states like Texas, assigning values to most homes is pretty straightforward. That is especially true in active markets where home sales are healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial and industrial real estate is more complicated. A hotel or an office building, for instance, can be valued on sales prices, if any are available, and if, in a state where those prices are closely held business secrets, they are reliable. A property can be valued on income — some multiple of how much it produces in rent every year. The land might be worth more than whatever is on it, and the value could be based on what it would be worth if developed. You could easily spend four years in college learning all of the ways to put a number on the value of a building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or on how to discredit a value someone else assigns to it. That is what the lawyers are for, and it is also why they have pretty good arguments. Their success at arguing for lower property values is also fodder for protests from others. It looks like they are getting a deal when they bring down an appraisal, whether they are or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Put valuation in the suggestion box for the next legislative session. It can go in next to the proposal for abolishing property taxes and replacing them with sales or other consumption taxes, an idea sparking debate in the race for comptroller. Lawmakers arrive in Austin every two years with freshly burnished proposals to limit annual increases in property taxes, rates or appraisals. Property taxes are the primary source of revenue for public schools in Texas, and with that financing system under court review, it is reasonable to expect some kind of legislative attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawmakers could raise more money with property taxes, or lower rates or change valuations. It is hard to know. But this is clear: Across the political spectrum, the people they listen to — voters — are irritated about property taxes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Scepanovic, 44, is a founder and the managing director of the Ideal Properties Group, a brokerage firm based in Brooklyn[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/brooklyn/?inline=nyt-geo] that focuses on residential and commercial property in the borough. Ms. Scepanovic, a native of Serbia, started the company in 2007 with her partner, Erik Serras.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interview conducted and condensed by</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VIVIAN MARINO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Do you have a nickname?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. They call me Sashka.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. So what is your main role in the company?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. My main role is really business and brand development. Erik and I consult on every single level of the business, but he’s more of a salesperson. He’s our principal broker — he manages the team of managers, and they manage the entire sales force. I’m a broker, too, but I’m not a producing broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How large is your sales force?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. About 100 agents right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You started the company just before the housing market crashed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Well, actually, the market was already going a little south toward the end of 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We literally took all our life savings. We started the company in a spare bedroom in our brownstone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Why the focus on Brooklyn?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We had worked at real estate companies in Manhattan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo] and one of the things that we really didn’t have was support for the Brooklyn market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We felt that there was not enough representation — even for ourselves. We owned and still own a brownstone in Prospect Heights, and I remember walking down Seventh Avenue in Park Slope way back when, walking into every single brokers’ office and then asking if someone could help us rent out one of our apartments. They just said, “Leave your business card and someone will get back to you.” And nobody ever got back to us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then we thought, we have a lot of friends who own property who have apartments, why not just come back home and do real estate here? So we started as a rental company, basically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You do sales and property management. Which do you do more of?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. If you asked me this question last year or maybe a year and a half ago, I would say about 80 percent of our business was rentals. But I think now we’re almost at a 40-60 ratio in favor of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2012 and 2013 it literally fivefolded. Rental production also increased, but just in the first two months of 2014 we have already surpassed our entire production for 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What are inventory levels like in the areas where you’re focused?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Actually there’s a drought of inventory in Brooklyn. It’s very difficult to get your hands on anything, because people are not really selling. That’s one of the biggest issues that every Brooklyn broker is finding right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some new developments coming down the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Which new developments are you representing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We just sold 180 19th Street — that was a few units in South Slope. We have a few rental projects in the pipeline right now: 400 15th Street, 683 Fourth Avenue, 255 17th Street. Most in South Slope and Park Slope. Also, 603 Fourth Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we’re just about done with the United American Land’s project in Brooklyn Heights, at 184 Joralemon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also did 50 Orange and 161 Columbia Heights, former Jehovah’s Witnesses buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What kinds of monthly rents are you seeing in these new developments?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. A really good two-bedroom apartment, for example, in Prospect Heights would probably cost you $4,500, which is probably $600 to $700 more than just a year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have gone up and I think they are going to continue to do that. It’s the lack of inventory, partially. It’s also the fact that Brooklyn has dramatically changed. The entire world is looking at Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Speaking of which, are you getting many foreign clients?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Funny you should ask me that, because we’re in the middle of putting together a buyer and tenant profile for this quarter. We have noticed that in terms of rentals, most of the interest is coming from people who are already living in Brooklyn. Then the secondary would be people who currently live in Manhattan, followed by the tristate area. Then we have random Canadians and Russians and French.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What’s the range of sales prices in the areas that you cover?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Townhouses in prime neighborhoods — you can’t find anything that’s under $1.8 million. In really prime neighborhoods, three- to four-story brownstones are going for $3 to $7 million. We’re lucky we got our piece of the pie moons ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Which are the prime — and almost prime — markets?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The strongest markets would be north and northwest Brooklyn, so anything surrounding Park Slope and Williamsburg. And obviously there’s a more exclusive and a more interesting trend going on in Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens. They are a completely different kind of a product, though. The emerging areas include Gowanus; it’s an industrial area just about to explode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Do you ever see Ideal Properties expanding outside Brooklyn?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We are entertaining possibly spreading into Manhattan, probably downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Where would you like to see the company in the next five to 10 years?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We’re looking forward to becoming a household name.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People moving to Fairfield County from other regions of the country often suffer sticker shock when they begin house-hunting. But that was not the case for Rebecca and Peter Cook, who relocated to Ridgefield from San Francisco two years ago for Mr. Cook's job with <span class="companylink">IBM</span>. Coming from one of the most expensive housing markets in the country, the Cooks weren't intimidated by Ridgefield's $600,000-plus median home price. Rather, they were entranced by the three-century-old town's signature village center, with its broad, tree-lined Main Street, grand historic homes and charming downtown storefronts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their reaction the very first time they drove up Main Street, Ms. Cook says, was ''this is what a small town in Connecticut should look like.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple focused their search in the Main Street area and managed to claim a seven-bedroom, 1890s Victorian for $1.25 million. They are most content. Downtown is only a short stroll away, very manageable with their two young children. And compared with the midcentury modern they left behind in California, the Victorian is ''ridiculously huge,'' Ms. Cook said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bedroom community for Stamford, White Plains and New York City, Ridgefield has enticed many a corporate transferee with its carefully preserved guise of small-town Americana. While the wealthy town is replete with sophisticated arts and cultural offerings -- it has its own professional symphony orchestra, for example, and is home to the nationally known Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum -- residents also take pride in simpler pastimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On summer evenings, downtown's five-acre Ballard Park fills with families in lawn chairs who picnic while taking in the free concerts. The annual Memorial Day parade is an even bigger community event -- ''half the town marches, and half the town watches,'' joked Maureen Maher, a longtime resident and an agent with William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a cart on Main Street serves that most American of foods, hot dogs, albeit with a French twist. A sidewalk fixture in all but the most brutal weather, Chez Lénard, run by Michael Principi, serves up such gourmet renditions as ''Le hot dog Garniture Suisse,'' which comes with cheese fondue in white wine and kirsch. ''In spring, summer and fall, I've got the best job,'' Mr. Principi said. ''In the winter, I'm pitied out here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all its outward tranquillity, however, Ridgefield (population, 25,000) is still feeling pangs from the recession. Financial industry layoffs drove up the town's unemployment rate from the pre-2008 level of 2 percent to nearly 6 percent, where it continues to stubbornly hover, said Rudy Marconi, who has served as Ridgefield's first selectman since 1999. And there have already been eight home foreclosures this year, with more to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Marconi sees signs of improvement. After all but drying up during the recession, home sales suddenly bounced back to more normal levels last summer. ''It was like somebody turned a light switch on,'' he said. And while the recreation department's fitness center memberships and summer camp registrations dropped off when residents' disposable income dwindled, revenues are now ahead of projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located on the western edge of Fairfield County, Ridgefield butts up against Westchester County, where many of its residents work. Its hilly terrain covers 35 square miles, which includes several sizable lakes and some 5,000 acres of preserved open space. About 85 percent of the housing stock consists of single-family homes. Colonials and Capes are predominant, though equestrian farms and estates embellish the countryside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate offices and restaurants have come to dominate the Main Street storefronts, with independent retailers mixed among them. The commercial corridor extends beyond Main to Danbury Road, where it gives way to a more generic lineup of shopping centers and strip malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ridgefield's public library is nearing the end of a $20 million renovation, nearly $15 million of it funded through private contributions, according to Mary Rindfleisch, the assistant director. The renovation incorporates the historic stone front and nearly doubles the old library's size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the library, a new nonprofit movie theater complex, the Prospector, is scheduled to open this summer. The three-screen theater, bar and cafe will also serve as a vocational training center for developmentally disabled adults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After perking up last summer, home sales in Ridgefield ''took a nice long winter nap,'' said Ms. Maher of William Pitt. A total of 10 homes sold in all of February. Inventory is very low, with less than 200 homes listed for sale. But Ms. Maher expects a busier spring -- she has at least four new listings waiting in the wings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current median sale price for a single-family home is $686,000, based on the sale of 26 homes this year, according to Ms. Maher. That's 35 percent higher than the median last year at this time, when 38 homes had sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of single-family homes are priced at $500,000 to $750,000. Listings in the $1 million to $2 million range are at a surplus right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for condominiums is $278,000. Of the 25 condos listed in late March, prices ranged from $158,000 for a one-bedroom to $835,000 for a four-bedroom townhouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> is seeking to build 30 age-restricted condominiums on the former Schlumberger research campus, which is now owned by the town. The developer would pay the town $4 million for the property, Mr. Marconi said. The deal must be approved at a town referendum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ridgefield Playhouse books an impressive variety of musicians and comedians -- the April lineup includes Art Garfunkel, Charles Grodin, the Goo Goo Dolls, and Melissa Etheridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town's recreation center has a pool, exercise equipment and fitness classes. An all-inclusive family membership is $85 per month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walking, jogging and cross-country skiing are encouraged on the 2.5-mile rail trail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ridgefield maintains a surprising six elementary schools, which enables neighborhoods to have their own schools. With so many schools, class sizes are small. Ms. Cook says her daughter's first-grade class has about 15 students. The district also has full-day kindergarten.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two middle schools serve Grades 6 to 8. Grades are organized into smaller ''teams,'' or learning communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ridgefield High School, serving about 1,800 students, has a rigorous academic program that includes such offerings as computer science, robotics, Mandarin, a three-year science research track, and numerous advanced placement courses. SAT scores for the class of 2013 were 580 in reading, 590 in math, and 589 in writing, compared with the state means of 499, 503 and 504.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ridgefield does have a rail station in the corner of town known as Branchville, but New York City commuters find it quicker to travel from the <span class="companylink">Metro-North Railroad</span> station in Katonah, N.Y. The trip to Grand Central is about 65 minutes. A monthly pass is $343.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ridgefield recently adopted an anti-blight ordinance, but in the 1800s, residents did not fuss about a falling-down house on Florida Hill Road singularly occupied by a man named George Washington Gilbert. According to an account by the local historian Jack Sanders, Gilbert was known as a hermit who never went into town, and some believe he took to seclusion after the death of a girlfriend. Gilbert had numerous visitors, however, and a businessman who lived nearby eventually built him a cottage toward the end of his life. He remained reclusive, however, and was discovered there frozen to death in January 1924.</p>
<p>The broad, tree-lined Main Street, lined with historic homes and charming storefronts, anchors the town's village center and is popular with joggers. (PHOTOGRAPH BY WENDY CARLSON FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) MAPS   </p>

</div><div class="author">By KIMIKO DE FREYTAS-TAMURA and STEVEN ERLANGER   </div><div>1454 words</div><div>1 April 2014</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>16</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian listings on the <span class="companylink">London Stock Exchange</span>. Russians buying multimillion-dollar homes in Chelsea, on streets dubbed Billionaires’ Row. Russian children in Britain’s most exclusive schools, while their parents shop at <span class="companylink">Harrods</span> and Asprey. Russians running soccer clubs and newspapers and cellars that sell some of the world’s most expensive wines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All are supposed evidence of a London so in thrall to Russian money that Britain should think twice before agreeing to any ratcheting up of the limited economic sanctions the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> and United States have imposed since Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The worry is that London, as a global financial center, might suffer disproportionate collateral damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the data suggest otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the contribution made by Russians to London’s prosperity and economic activity is significant, it is not crucial. Conspicuous Russian affluence is misleading, because the wealth is concentrated in the hands of a very few. Oligarchs like Roman Abramovich, the owner of the Chelsea soccer club, get lots of attention. But among the estimated 300,000 Russians living in Britain, few of his compatriots are anywhere near as wealthy as he.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The Battle of Londongrad?’’ scoffed Raoul Ruparel, head of economic research at Open Europe, a London-based research house. ‘‘How vulnerable is the City to sanctions on Russia?’’ he asked rhetorically, referring to London’s financial district. ‘‘Claims that the City of London would suffer major losses in case of financial sanctions against Russia are overblown.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Absolute figures for Russian deals and purchases are large, Mr. Ruparel said, ‘‘but that’s because London is a huge global financial center, and you need to put numbers in context.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian influence is said to be felt most in London’s financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the energy giant <span class="companylink">Gazprom</span> became the first Russian company to list in London 18 years ago, an additional 67 have done so. But together they make up only about 5 percent of the total. They are roughly in line with other nationalities: 95 are from the United States, 62 from India and 59 from China, according to the exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian issuers have accounted for about $50 billion of listings on London exchanges over the past decade, representing around a fifth of offerings by value in that period, according to Dealogic, a data provider. But most of that activity was before the global financial crisis. In 2007, 14 Russian companies got London listings. Last year, there was only one: the bank and credit card company <span class="companylink">TCS Group Holding</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor are British banks highly exposed to Russia, said Gilles Moëc, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. He estimates that British banks have around $19 billion worth of exposure to Russia, including loans and securities, which represents only about 0.2 percent of their total assets. French and Austrian banks are much more exposed than British ones, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2009 to 2013 Britain granted three-year visas to 433 Russians who invested in government bonds worth at least 1 million pounds, or $1.66 million, allowing them to buy residency for £10 million two years later, so long as they held on to the bonds. Only the Chinese came close, with 419 receiving such investor visas. While the figure is high, the share of Russians able to afford these visas was just 0.14 percent of the Russians living in Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lavish lifestyles have also helped cement views about stratospheric levels of Russian wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yevgeny Chichvarkin, who made and lost his fortune in a mobile phone empire in Russia, came to London and opened a luxury store called Hedonism Wines in 2012 in Mayfair. It sells vintage wines like Château d’Yquem 1811, a bottle of which set a world record for being the most expensive white wine ever sold, at £75,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Meet the Russians,’’ a television series that ran here on the Fox network last year, portrayed what it described as a ‘‘jaw dropping’’ world of unimaginable riches. But among prime London residential property sales, which represent the top 5 percent of the market, only 2 percent of buyers last year were Russians, who spent an average of £4.5 million on their homes, according to <span class="companylink">Savills</span>, which specializes in luxury real estate. They were far behind buyers from North America, the Middle East, China and South Asia, <span class="companylink">Savills</span> data show. Britons, meanwhile, accounted for roughly two-thirds of all the buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some business people in London who cater to Russians are worried that the Western sanctions are beginning to chafe. Julia Titova, for instance, has less than a month to go until the start of her Miss U.S.S.R. beauty pageant, which gathers contestants living in London from Russia and 14 former Soviet republics. But some of her celebrity guests and judges from Moscow are waiting in line for British travel visas, and she is worried they may not arrive in time. She suspects the delay is intentional. ‘‘The waiting time is a lot longer than before,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the British Border Agency said the delay was ‘‘just a coincidence’’ because it changed its local Russian contractor for commercial visas a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some schools are anxious, too. Around 2,150 Russian children were enrolled in British private schools and boarding schools last year, a 25 percent rise from the previous year. But that is only about a third of the number from China and Hong Kong, according to the <span class="companylink">Independent Schools Council</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from buying property, Russians don’t generally invest in Britain unless there is a plum opportunity, said a tax adviser who serves Russian clients and spoke only on condition of anonymity for fear of alienating his clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary concern of wealthy Russians, he said, is to keep their money as far away as possible from the Russian government and anything that could land them in jail back home. They are less worried, if not at all, about the damages caused by Western sanctions, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A government official reinforced that sentiment. ‘‘Being a rich Russian is not sanctionable,’’ a senior official at the <span class="companylink">Foreign Office</span> said on condition of anonymity, in keeping with diplomatic custom. The official, however, emphasized that Britain was acting within the context of the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, which has limited sanctioning individuals so far to those it deems directly involved in the annexation of Crimea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British tax levels provide no incentive for Russians to keep and manage their wealth here, the tax adviser said. Most assets are squirreled away in offshore bank accounts in places like the Channel Islands, off the French coast, which are part of neither Britain nor the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> and are therefore beyond the reach of the sanctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fabulously wealthy oligarchs, who made fortunes overnight when the Soviet Union collapsed, ‘‘don’t feel comfortable in Russia,’’ said Bill Browder, the London-based chief executive and co-founder of Hermitage Capital Management, which is registered in the Channel Island of Guernsey and specializes in Russian investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘As easy as it was for them to plunder the country,’’ Mr. Browder said of the oligarchs, ‘‘it’s easy for the government to do the same to them.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Browder knows firsthand how sanctions against Russia can boomerang. He was behind the Magnitsky Act, enacted in the United States in 2012, which froze bank accounts and seized assets of 18 Russian officials allegedly involved in the death of his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who had tried to expose government tax fraud in Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Browder has been convicted in Moscow in absentia for tax evasion in what was largely seen as a political trial. The American law set off a diplomatic spat with Russia, which retaliated by approving a similar law against Americans accused of rights abuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Mr. Browder, said Britain should not shy from pressing for further sanctions now against Russia. ‘‘There are a number of professionals in the United Kingdom who feed off Russian blood money,’’ Mr. Browder said. ‘‘But even without the Russians, London will continue as a financial center.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As published in the International New York Times</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Tuesday about the potential ricochet effect on London of sanctions against Russia because of its annexation of Crimea misstated the position of the Channel Islands in regard to the sanctions against Russia for its annexation of Crimea. While the islands are independent from Britain and the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, they have chosen to mirror the sanctions. It is not the case that Russian assets there are ‘‘beyond the reach of the sanctions.’’</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who doesn't enjoy a good yarn about Russian oligarchs who throw their fortunes at New York real estate? Take the Russian fertilizer king Dmitry Rybolovlev, who is linked to a record-breaking $88 million sale at 15 Central Park West, or the composer Igor Krutoy, who bought three apartments at the Plaza Hotel. Yet these tales of excess could soon fade into memory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moscow may be 4,500 miles from Manhattan, but with tensions intensifying over the annexation of Crimea, an Arctic Russian blast could chill the high-flying luxury real estate market here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rich Russians have long been a force in the city, headlining some of its flashiest apartment sales, but now many are fearful that buying a New York apartment could have political ramifications at home. And even if they were willing to risk President Vladimir V. Putin's ire, economic sanctions and visa restrictions might soon make such purchases impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no official figures, but anecdotally, about 40 percent of the condominium and townhouse buyers in Manhattan are foreigners, and more than half of buyers in new developments come from overseas, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. It is unclear what percentage of that total is Russian, but Russian buyers have dominated the news in recent years, along with buyers from China and Brazil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of Russian cold feet couldn't come at a worse time, as condominium prices at the high end of the market are surpassing levels reached during the peak of the last real estate boom, and developers are buying up sites at a frenzied pace. New projects, planned with billionaire foreign buyers in mind, are altering the landscape of the city. Perhaps most notable is the spate of super-tall, narrow towers in the works along West 57th Street, their long shapes casting a shadow on Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victoria Shtainer, an associate broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>, has felt the chill firsthand. She had been working with a Russian buyer, a legislator, since December. With a budget of $25 million to $52 million, he had been considering listings at the Plaza Hotel and the Marquand, a new development at 11 East 68th Street. He was coming to New York for a visit this month when Russian forces invaded Crimea. Soon afterward, Ms. Shtainer learned via an email that ''due to relations with the U.S., he was canceling his trip,'' she said. ''It said he wanted to wait until things quieted down.'' Another of Ms. Shtainer's Russian clients, who had been looking for an apartment in the $4 million to $5 million range, also canceled a visit. ''She told me she was afraid to get a visa, that they were just going to wait it out,'' Ms. Shtainer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Putin has drawn a red line -- he has made it clear that 'you are either with us or against us,' '' said Mark Reznik, a broker at A &amp; I Broadway Realty, which has many clients from the former Soviet Union. ''There is so much propaganda in Russia, people are scared to do business here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elliot Bogod, the president of A &amp; I Broadway Realty, also has several clients who are pausing to regroup. ''I have a client who almost signed a contract in Battery Park City but now wants to wait,'' he said. The buyers, a couple who live in central Kiev, are concerned that the Ukrainian government will forbid citizens to remove their money. ''They are worried that they won't be able to transfer funds or pay the common charges,'' Mr. Bogod said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But real estate brokers naturally love to spin the news positively, and they argue that the freeze is just temporary. The wealthy in Moscow now see the writing on the wall, the argument goes, and so they will soon start strategizing on ways to relocate their money, and even themselves, to New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is the whole idea of flight to safety,'' said Edward A. Mermelstein, a real estate lawyer who does a lot of business in Russia, and who says he is fielding more calls now from clients in the region. ''Anytime there is uncertainty overseas, it is a good time to bring money to the U.S.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For anyone looking to move assets stateside, real estate can be an excellent option -- particularly for anyone wanting to avoid intense scrutiny. A transaction in a new development, for example, involves buying directly from the sponsor, or developer, who demands little in the way of personal information. ''If you open a bank account,'' said Jacky Teplitzky, a broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, ''you have to answer a lot of questions, or with stocks there is a lot of oversight. In new construction, there is no board, no application, nothing. You just write a check and buy an apartment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Teplitzky is representing several Russians who are looking to buy in New York and Miami. She says that although it is true Russians fear reprisals internally if they move assets overseas, and are concerned about the prospect of economic sanctions, ''they are trying to think of their worst- or best-case scenario, and they have to take a chance either way; it isn't like they can do nothing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Russians who are moving ahead with purchases hope to fly under the radar; thus, rather than buy a high-profile penthouse, they are choosing smaller apartments. ''Because they don't want their names in the paper,'' Ms. Teplitzky said, ''they are using a different strategy that is less visible. Nobody writes about the $2 million deals, right? They all want to cover the big expensive purchases.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russians who might begin looking to buy in the States could also be of a different ilk than before. ''I think the freeze is going to be temporary,'' said Mr. Reznick, ''and then, over the next three years as the sanctions get tougher, we will see a new kind of buyer, not an investor, but someone who is looking to emigrate. Russians will realize they want to buy a place here not just for investment, or not just for their kids while they are in college, but a place for the whole family, a large family home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And real estate players can take some solace in knowing that even if Russian buyers dwindle, there are other rich foreigners who would gladly take their place. New York's profile is rapidly gaining favor among the global elite. According to the most recent Knight Frank Global Cities Survey, which tracks the cities of most importance to the world's wealthiest people, New York is in second place this year, behind London. And by 2024, the survey is predicting that New York will top the list. That could bring a welcome sigh of relief to all those New York luxury developers quaking under their hard hats in fear of a Russian exodus.</p>
<p>Wealthy Russians have been sinking fortunes into some of the priciest condominiums in Manhattan, including the Plaza Hotel, far left, 15 Central Park West, center, and the Marquand, at 11 East 68th Street.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HARDINGTON MANDEVILLE, England — While this late Georgian rectory stands in a picture postcard of a village in the English county of Somerset, the house has not been lived in for 12 years and needs considerable updating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is a wonderful chance for someone to completely restore and modernize a house in a lovely setting,” said James McKillop of the Knight Frank real estate agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 7,500-square-foot residence, called Hardington House, was built in 1826 of Portland stone. It sits on eight and a half acres of manicured gardens on the edge of a busy village, which has a shop, pub and an old church.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official permission to modernize and expand the house has lapsed, although agents say it would not be hard to get the permits reinstated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home, which has been on the market since last May, is listed at 2.35 million pounds, or $3.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Old rectories in Somerset are quite rare and do not change hands very regularly,” said George Wade, a partner at <span class="companylink">Property Vision</span>, an agency that represents buyers. Only 38 rectories, valued at £1 million to £4.5 million, have been sold in the county since 2007, according to the agency’s research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manor has a Grade II historic listing from the <span class="companylink">English Heritage</span> organization, which means it is of special historic interest. It has typical Georgian features such as the two tall columns that stand on either side of the front door, high ceilings, sash windows and a large central staircase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjacent to the main house is a refurbished three-bedroom cottage with fireplace, where the current owners live. In addition to the walled garden, there is a small outdoor swimming pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An apartment was created upstairs in the coach house, and its ground floor could be renovated too. The former stable now is used as an office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outbuildings, all of which are included in the sale price, were refurbished within the last 10 years. While the compound is a half-hour’s drive from the coast, the buildings could be used for vacation rentals as the surrounding countryside is popular with tourists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house is about four miles from the town of Yeovil, and 2.5 hours by train from Waterloo station in London. Also, it is close to well-regarded schools, including Perrott Hill preparatory school at North Perrott, about three miles away, and the independent Sherborne Boys and Sherborne Girls schools, which are 12 miles away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to research from the real estate agency Savills, house prices for prime property in the south of England (excluding London) have fallen almost 15 percent on average since 2007. The market is particularly slow for homes priced at more than £2 million, where the effect of the 7 percent stamp duty on sales “is proving to be greater than we had imagined, with fewer overall transactions across the market than normal,” Mr. McKillop said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, London prices for prime real estate have risen more than 30 percent during the same time period, and agents say the gap between values in the capital and the countryside has never been wider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wade said the market is “very price sensitive at the moment. There is an awful lot of stock which is overpriced and needs” to be reduced.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Growth in the Fourth Quarter Is Revised Up a Shade, to 2.6%</span>
</div><div class="author">By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ   </div><div>899 words</div><div>28 March 2014</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American economy grew by 2.6 percent in the final months of 2013, the Commerce Department said on Thursday, a slight uptick from its previous estimate but still well below the pace of growth recorded in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revised data for last quarter, in what was the government's third and final estimate of economic growth for the period, reflected slightly healthier consumer spending than first thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous estimate for the months of October, November and December, reported in late February, was 2.4 percent. Thursday's slight upward adjustment was in line with expectations among economists on Wall Street. The pace in the third quarter was 4.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the 3.3 percent increase in personal consumption expenditures last quarter was the healthiest showing since the fourth quarter of 2010, when consumption rose 4.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also came despite wintry weather in many parts of the country during the final weeks of the holiday shopping season, which prompted some economists to conclude that underlying consumer behavior was somewhat more robust than recent data had suggested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The number for gross domestic product is good,'' said Lawrence Creatura, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in Rochester, N.Y. ''It is not the exciting number that is typical of postrecession recoveries, but it is good enough. This has been a stumbling sort of recovery all along, and this number is a continuation of that pattern.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One part of the economy that has grown over all in recent years, the housing sector, seems to be slowing markedly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported on Thursday that its index of pending home sales dropped 0.8 percent in February to 93.9, the eighth straight monthly decline and the lowest level for the index since October 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop, showing demand for previously owned homes rather than new construction, reflects the impact of cold weather as well as the rise in interest rates since the spring of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Federal Reserve gradually eases up on its stimulus efforts and reduces the pace of its monthly bond purchases, 10-year note yields have crept up, pushing up rates for most mortgages. Housing was crushed in the recession of 2007 to 2009, but has rebounded in many parts of the country more recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One headwind for the economy in the first half of 2014, at least in terms of the picture provided by coming economic data, will be from the aftereffects of the big inventory gains recorded by businesses in the third quarter of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless demand turns out to be stronger than expected, those stockpiles will be drawn down gradually, reducing the rate of reported growth now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, some experts believe that consumer activity has been inhibited by the cold so far in 2014, so some catching-up might help growth as shoppers venture out again in April, May and June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp drop in federal spending, which shaved a full percentage point off growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 amid the government shutdown in the fall and the automatic budget cuts imposed by Congress, should also moderate in 2014 because of a budget deal reached on Capitol Hill in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That budget agreement also provides a bit more certainty for businesses in terms of what Washington will be laying out, something that has been lacking over the past few years because of repeated standoffs over government spending and the federal borrowing limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Labor Department said on Thursday that initial claims for unemployment dropped by 10,000 last week to 311,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had been expecting a slight increase in initial claims, so that figure represented a potential bright spot for the labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average for unemployment claims, which tends to be a bit more reliable than the more volatile week-to-week numbers, fell to 318,000, also an improvement from previous weeks and the healthiest rate in six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter, many economists predict the economy will expand at an annual rate of 1 to 2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate profits rose by 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter, but for the year were up 4.6 percent, which suggested companies continued to improve profits at a slightly faster rate than overall economic growth, thanks in part to efficiency gains. While the stock market and corporate profits have been healthy in recent years, those gains have not translated into the kind of hiring experienced in previous recoveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the arrival of spring and better weather, the thinking goes, the economy's momentum could pick up slightly. One indicator of what lies ahead will come next week, when the Labor Department reports figures for job creation and the unemployment rate in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job creation was anemic in December and January, and came in well below expectations, but picked up a bit in February.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Orders to United States factories for long-lasting manufactured goods rose in February by the largest amount in three months, helped by solid gains in demand for airplanes and autos. Also Wednesday, an industry group reported that applications for home mortgages fell last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods increased 2.2 percent last month, after a 1.3 percent drop in January, the Commerce Department said. The February rebound was led by a 13.6 percent surge in orders for commercial aircraft. Orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 3.6 percent, recovering from a January decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a category that serves as a proxy for business investment plans fell 1.3 percent in February, the biggest drop since a 1.6 percent December decline. Orders in this category had been up 0.8 percent in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As interest rates rose to the highest level since January, mortgage applications dropped, the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, declined 3.5 percent to 361.2 in the week ended March 21. That was down from an upwardly revised 374.2 the week before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications fell 7.7 percent, and the gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, rose 2.8 percent. The previous week's data was revised up for both of those indexes as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fixed 30-year mortgage rates averaged 4.56 percent in the week, the highest level since January, and up 6 basis points from 4.50 percent the week before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey covers over 75 percent of American retail residential mortgage applications, according to the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are looking for a sustained rebound in manufacturing as the economy improves this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big rise in demand for commercial aircraft followed a 22.1 percent plunge in the previous month in this traditionally volatile category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand rose for primary metals like steel by 1.6 percent, but orders for machinery fell 1.5 percent. Demand for computers was down 0.5 percent, and orders for communications equipment dropped 2.7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect manufacturing output to strengthen in coming months, reflecting better weather after a series of winter storms that disrupted production at some factories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said that its gauge of manufacturing activity expanded more quickly in February as companies received more orders and bolstered their stockpiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute's manufacturing index rose to 53.2 in February, up from 51.3 in January. That only partly reversed a five-point drop in January. Any reading above 50 indicates that manufacturing is expanding.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — American consumer confidence surged to a six-year high in March and house prices increased solidly in January, positioning the economy for stronger growth after a soft spot attributed to bad winter weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upbeat outlook, however, was dimmed somewhat by other data on Tuesday showing new-home sales at a five-month low in February, partly because of the cold weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The economy is showing signs of shaking off the weather effect. We are going to get a big lift to second-quarter growth from the weather,” said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> Analytics in West Chester, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said its index of consumer attitudes[http://www.conference-board.org/press/pressdetail.cfm?pressid=5137] rose to 82.3, from 78.3 in February. That is the highest level since January 2008, just as recession started to take hold, and it beat economists’ expectations for a reading of 78.6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jump in confidence bodes well for the economy’s prospects, even though consumers were less upbeat about the labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unusually cold and snowy winter has held back the economy, disrupting activity that includes hiring, spending and manufacturing. Growth in the first quarter is expected to have slowed considerably from the fourth quarter’s annualized 2.4 percent pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span>/Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 0.8 percent in January on a seasonally adjusted basis. It followed a similar increase in December. Prices rose 13.2 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house price gains, driven by a shortage of homes for sale, are bolstering household wealth and helping support consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The broad-based recovery in home prices, which started just under two years ago, remains well underway,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the dearth of properties is also weighing on the housing market’s recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said new-home sales fell 3.3 percent in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 440,000 units, the lowest since September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were off 1.1 percent from year-ago levels, the biggest year-on-year drop since September 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month’s drop brought new-home sales in line with other data like home resales and building activity, which have offered a downbeat picture of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weather has been blamed for some of the slowdown, but the tight supply and a run-up in mortgage rates are also taking a toll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped from a peak of 4.49 percent in September to about 4.30 percent in February, it remains a full percentage point higher than it was a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Worsening affordability and still-tight inventory are leading more Americans to rethink home buying this year,” said Ellen Haberle, an economist at Redfin in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the number of new houses on the market was the highest since December 2010, inventory remains tight. At February’s sales pace, it would take 5.2 months to clear inventories, up from 5.0 months in January and the most since September. A supply of 6.0 months is normally considered healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in the Northeast tumbled 32.4 percent, the biggest decline since October 2012 and an indication that severe weather continued to hurt activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell 1.5 percent in the South, surged 36.7 percent in the Midwest and fell 15.9 percent in the West.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Encouraging news on the economy helped lift the stock market on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation at the consumer level remained under control in February, the government reported, while applications for home building permits rose, a sign of increasing construction activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks also benefited from investor expectations that the conflict between Russia and the West would not escalate further. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is preparing to complete the annexation of Crimea, but he said on Tuesday that he would not seek to divide Ukraine any further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The annexation of Crimea “is a horrible thing for the world in the long term,” said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners. “But the market doesn’t want unrest.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index rose 13.42 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 1,872.25. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 88.97 points, or 0.6 percent, to 16,336.19. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite index climbed 53.36 points, or 1.3 percent, to 4,333.31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market also got a lift from two technology companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> rose $1.50, or 3.9 percent, to $39.55 after Reuters reported that the company might unveil[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/17/us-microsoft-ipad-idUSBREA2G1PJ20140317] an iPad version of its Office software suite on March 27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> rose $1.08, or 3.7 percent, to $30.56 after analysts at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> upgraded their outlook on the hardware company and raised their price target on the stock to $38 from $33.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the economic front, the Consumer Price Index rose 0.1 percent in February, matching January’s increase, the Labor Department said. In the last 12 months, prices have risen just 1.1 percent, the smallest yearly gain in five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 0.1 percent last month and 1.6 percent in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There isn’t much in this report to suggest inflation is about to make a move to the upside or downside,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>. Mr. Feroli pointed out that core inflation had been below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target for the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed’s policy makers will conclude their two-day meeting on Wednesday, and the benign report on consumer prices means the central bank can continue to focus on reducing unemployment and increasing economic growth without having to worry that its policies are stoking inflation. Most analysts do expect the Fed to continue to reduce its economic stimulus by cutting back on its bond purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, home construction fell for a third month in February, but applications for building permits reached their highest level in four months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders started work on 907,000 homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in February, the Commerce Department said. That was down a slight 0.2 percent from January, when construction had fallen 11.2 percent. The declines have been blamed in large part on severe winter weather in much of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for permits to build homes, considered a gauge of future activity, rose a solid 7.7 percent in February to 1.02 million units. Analysts expect housing sales and construction to show further gains this year, helped by a stronger economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of home builders rose. <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA</span> gained 52 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $20.57 and the <span class="companylink">Ryland Group</span> picked up $1.23, or 3.1 percent, to $41.40.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In government bond trading, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.67 percent from 2.69 percent, while its price rose 5/32, to 100 21/32.</p>

</div><div class="author">By LISA PREVOST   </div><div>630 words</div><div>16 March 2014</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners who refinanced when fixed mortgage rates dropped below 4 percent will be less inclined to put their homes on the market as interest rates climb. And as a result, the limited property supply already impeding sales in many markets may not ease anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent survey by Redfin[http://www.redfin.com/research/reports/real-time-market-sentiment/2014/buyer-survey-q1-2014.html], a national real estate brokerage based in Seattle, suggests that even those beneficiaries of low-refinance rates who do decide to move may want to make money renting out their homes while waiting for prices to rise, rather than sell right away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redfin questioned 1,900 people nationwide who said they planned to buy a home within a year; 42 percent said they already owned one, and of those, 39 percent said they planned to rent it out after they moved. The survey also asked buyers about their frustrations with the process, and “low inventory” topped the list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market dynamics are encouraging owners to keep their homes off the market for now, said Anthony Hsieh, the chief executive of loanDepot, a mortgage lender. “The rental market is very, very healthy today because a lot of Americans are locked out of the mortgage market,” he said. “And there is the promise that real estate is going to appreciate, because we’re just coming out of a deep recession.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, most borrowers can’t afford to buy another home without using equity from their first for a down payment. But Mr. Hsieh says that those who were able to take advantage of low refinance rates tend to be “premium consumers,” with very good credit and stable, above-average incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These are the folks that will think twice before they pay off that mortgage that is such cheap money,” he said. “They’re going to explore all types of options before they do that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They may want to consider a few other factors before taking on tenants, said Jed Kolko, the chief economist of Trulia, an online marketplace for residential real estate. First is the effort involved in managing a rental property. Second is the greater financial risk of owning two homes in the same market should home prices take a dive. And third is the changing nature of what’s driving rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Over the past several years,” Mr. Kolko said, “the strong demand for renting single-family homes has been driven by people who lost homes to foreclosure but still wanted to stay in the same area. But now it is more driven by young people, and they are more urban focused.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patric H. Hendershott, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Housing Studies at <span class="companylink">DePaul University</span> in Chicago, says he has witnessed the current allure of being a landlord firsthand. He lives in a housing community for older people, and he has recently noticed that residents who are moving to larger units are choosing to rent out their smaller ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he views another scenario as more likely for low-rate holders: Those who can’t afford to move on without selling will essentially be “locked into” their homes. As interest rates rise, even buying another home at the same price will result in a higher mortgage payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent analysis[http://www.housingstudies.org/media/filer_public/2014/02/24/ihs_researchbrief_impactoflockingeffectsonhousingturnoverandrecovery_feb2014.pdf] of the effect of lock-ins, Mr. Hendershott predicted that if rates continue to rise, the result will be substantial declines in housing turnover in strong housing markets, in which large numbers of households refinanced at low rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We had a big episode of this in the 1980s,” he said, recalling when soaring interest rates locked in large numbers of homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research cited in his analysis found that during that period, household mobility declined by 15 percent for every 2 percent increase in rates.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March has been an up-and-down stretch for the stock market, but it is turning into a month of milestones nonetheless. The bull market reached its fifth anniversary last weekend, and if the trend continues this week, on Saturday it will become the fifth-longest bull market since 1928.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, it’s the fourth-strongest bull, with a gain of more than 172 percent in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps most significantly, Federal Reserve[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/federal_reserve_system/index.html?inline=nyt-org] figures released this month show that levitating stock prices were the primary cause [http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/z1r-1.pdf] of a surge in total household wealth to $80.7 trillion in 2013 — the highest level in American history, &nbsp;even after inflation is taken into account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this is undoubtedly reason for celebration, especially for the affluent households that hold the bulk of the wealth and have benefited most from the stock market’s big rebound. But for anyone with even a modest stake in the market — as well as for Janet L. Yellen and the other Fed policy makers who are at least partly responsible for the market’s rise — the startling increase in asset prices also raises difficult questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For market strategists, chief among them may be this: How will the bull market respond as the Fed throttles its accommodative monetary policy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, with Ms. Yellen at the helm for the first time, policy makers are expected to discuss how to proceed with the tightening of monetary policy without causing serious problems for financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the Fed began to wean the markets off the extraordinary monetary stimulus that has swelled the central bank’s balance sheet [http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm] above $4.1 trillion from a relatively meager $869 billion in August 2007. The central bank has been gradually reducing its monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities; it is expected to continue holding interest rates near zero for many months, and it may try to more clearly signal its intentions to the markets. It is reining in its stimulus program, not ending it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unleashing that policy in the first place had powerful effects, which the central bank has acknowledged. After the stock market hit bottom, Ben S. Bernanke, then the Fed chairman, and other Fed officials said repeatedly that by bringing down bond yields and making credit more available, they hoped to increase the appeal of riskier assets like stocks, stimulating the economy. By the Fed’s own criteria, the economic recovery is still incomplete. But the restoration of prices to their pre-financial-crisis levels has already occurred in many asset categories, and then some.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(As big as the stock market rally has been, it’s far from the strongest or the longest we’ve seen. The rally from Dec. 4, 1987, to March 24, 2000, has a lock on first place in both categories, with a gain of 582 percent over that period, according to figures from the Bespoke Investment Group going back to 1928.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central bank policies that lead to higher stock prices can distort financial markets, said Joseph G. Carson, director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Household debt and corporate debt have been reduced sharply,” Mr. Carson said. “But the Fed has effectively moved the debt onto its own balance sheet. It’s crucial that they unwind it, but the question is, how?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has helped to sustain the bull market in stocks, and because home values have also risen in the last year, many middle-class people have begun to spend more freely, spurring short-term economic growth, he said. But one effect of Fed policies has been to widen wealth inequality. That’s because the wealthy hold a high proportion of their assets in the stock market and benefit when the market rises, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What’s more, stock market prices have increased far more rapidly than housing prices, and the net worth of less wealthy Americans is heavily concentrated in the value of their homes. In a note to clients, Mr. Carson pointed out that average home prices rose roughly 10 percent in 2013 while the S.&amp;P. 500 index surged more than 30 percent, disproportionately benefiting those who held stock. And, of course, those with neither home equity nor financial assets fell further behind those who own both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed’s report, “Financial Accounts of the United States,” broke down the figures this way: While the total value of real estate in the United States increased $2.3 trillion, the total value of stocks grew by $5.6 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if such issues provide a subtext for Fed discussions, the direct effects of Fed policy on the stock and housing markets may not be an explicit part of the Fed’s agenda this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s partly because Congress didn’t include financial asset prices in the Fed’s mandate[http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section2a.htm], which is “to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates.” Those stable prices referred to items like cars, food and shoes, not to financial assets like stocks and bonds, whose price levels fall outside the Fed’s traditional purview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Fed closely monitors financial market price levels, and it has taken on growing responsibility for maintaining the stability of the entire financial system. In congressional testimony, Ms. Yellen has said that the central bank needs to “attempt to detect asset bubbles” in both the stock and the housing markets. She has also said that she sees no such bubbles in evidence now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may not be full-blown bubbles at this moment. But valuations have become much less attractive as prices have risen. Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, is among those who have argued vigorously that the Fed needs to cut back sharply on its monetary stimulus because it has, in his view, been feeding speculative bubbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech in Mexico City on March 5, [http://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/fisher/2014/fs140305.cfm] Mr. Fisher said, “There are increasing signs quantitative easing[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/q/quantitative_easing/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] has overstayed its welcome: Market distortions and acting on bad incentives are becoming more pervasive.” He listed a series of stock valuation measures and said they were “at eye-popping levels not seen since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fisher’s view appears to be a minority one at the Fed, but he makes some telling points. Certainly, as the stock market reaches ever more impressive milestones, it’s important, as he says, to monitor market indicators very carefully, “to ensure that the ghost of ‘irrational exuberance’ does not haunt us again.”</p>
<p>When the Federal Open Market Committee meets this week, with Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Fed, at the helm for the first time, policy makers are expected to discuss how to tighten monetary policy without causing serious problems for financial markets. | Alex Wong/Getty Images   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GILBERT, Ariz. -- In many American suburbs, outward signs of life are limited to the blue glow of television screens flickering behind energy-efficient windows. But in a subdivision of this bedroom community outside Phoenix, amid precision-cut lawns and Craftsman-style homes, lambs caper in common green areas, chickens scratch in a citrus grove and residents roam rows of heirloom vegetables to see what might be good for dinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood is called Agritopia, and it's one of a growing number of so-called agrihoods, residential developments where a working farm is the central feature, in the same way that other communities may cluster around a golf course, pool or fitness center. The real estate bust in 2008 halted new construction, but with the recovery, developers are again breaking ground on farm-focused tracts. At least a dozen projects across the country are thriving, enlisting thousands of home buyers who crave access to open space, verdant fields and fresh food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hear from developers all the time about this,'' said Ed McMahon, a senior fellow for sustainable development at the <span class="companylink">Urban Land Institute</span>, a nonprofit real estate research group in Washington, D. C. ''They've figured out that unlike a golf course, which costs millions to build and millions to maintain, they can provide green space that actually earns a profit.'' Not to mention a potential tax break for preserving agricultural land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixteen of Agritopia's 160 acres are certified organic farmland, with row crops (artichokes to zucchini), fruit trees (citrus, nectarine, peach, apple, olive and date) and livestock (chickens and sheep). Fences gripped by grapevines and blackberry bushes separate the farm from the community's 452 single-family homes, each with a wide front porch and sidewalks close enough to encourage conversation. A 117-unit assisted- and independent-living center is set to open this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hub of neighborhood life is a small square overlooking the farm, with a coffeehouse, farm-to-table restaurant and honor-system farm stand. The square is also where residents line up on Wednesday evenings to claim their bulging boxes of just-harvested produce, eggs and honey, which come with a $100-a-month membership in the community-supported agriculture, or C.S.A., program. Neighbors trade recipes and gossip, and on the way home can pick up dinner from one of a few food trucks stocked by the farm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wednesday is the highlight of my week,'' said Ben Wyffels, an engineer for Intel who moved here with his wife and two sons two years ago from another Phoenix suburb, attracted by the farm and the community's cohesiveness. ''To be able to walk down the street with my kids and get fresh, healthy food is amazing,'' he said, and has helped steer his family toward kale and carrots and away from chicken nuggets and hot dogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This way of life does not come at a premium, either; Mr. Wyffels, like residents of other agrihoods, said his home cost no more than similar houses in the area. And because the Agritopia farm is self-sustaining, as farms are in many of these developments, no fees are charged to support it, other than the cost of buying produce at the farm stand or joining the C.S.A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agritopia was among the first agrihoods -- like Serenbe in Chattahoochee Hills, Ga.; Prairie Crossing in Grayslake, Ill.; South Village in South Burlington, Vt.; and Hidden Springs in Boise, Idaho -- established just as the real estate market collapsed. They have emerged intact, with property values appreciating and for-sale signs rare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Serenbe, all 152 homes are occupied and its 3 restaurants draw tourists from surrounding states. Builders are adding 10 custom homes, with plans to break ground on at least another 20 by year-end. The 7-acre organic farm, soon to expand to 25 acres, lured Vikki Baird, a fund-raising consultant, who moved to Serenbe last summer from the affluent Buckhead neighborhood in Atlanta. She had divorced, and said she was looking for a ''healthy place'' to settle. ''You walk down the street, open your bag and say, 'Give me what's fresh this week,' '' Ms. Baird said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newer developments include Willowsford in Ashburn, Va., which opened in 2011 and was named the National Association of Homebuilders' 2013 suburban Community of the Year, largely because of its 30-acre farm and a culinary consultant who regularly teaches classes in how to prepare whatever is in season. The Kukui'ula community in Kauai, Hawaii, opened in 2012 and has a 10-acre farm in addition to a clubhouse, spa and golf course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a developer it's been humbling that such a simple thing and such an inexpensive thing is the most loved amenity,'' said Brent Herrington, who oversaw the building of Kukui'ula for the developer <span class="companylink">DMB Associates</span>. ''We spend $100 million on a clubhouse, but residents, first day on the island, they go to the farm to get flowers, fruits and vegetables.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Herrington regularly fields calls from other developers who want to incorporate farms into their housing projects. At least a dozen new agrihoods are underway or have secured financing, including Bucking Horse in Fort Collins, Colo.; Skokomish Farms in Union, Wash.; Harvest in Northlake, Tex.; <span class="companylink">Rancho Mission Viejo</span> in Orange County, Calif.; and Prairie Commons in South Olathe, Kan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their success or failure may depend on hiring the right farmer. Agritopia went through four before finding the right one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This type of farming is hard and requires an incredible ability to multitask,'' said Joseph E. Johnston, the developer and a resident of Agritopia, which sits on what was once his family's farm. ''I'm not sure most developers have the patience to really see it through and make it work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Mr. Johnston's father planted four kinds of commodity crops, like cotton and corn, a community farmer must plant a vast variety of highly perishable, organic (or at least not chemically treated) crops, then market them to residents and sell the excess at farmers' markets and to local chefs. Agritopia sells to 20 highly regarded chefs, including Charleen Badman (a.k.a. the ''Vegetable Whisperer'') of the restaurant FnB and Chris Bianco of Pizzeria Bianco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to be an excellent grower but also good at customer relations, business projections and labor controls,'' Mr. Johnston said. ''There's no manual or anyone at the county extension service to tell you how to do this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For guidance, many developers are turning to suburban farm consultants like Agriburbia in Golden, Colo., and Farmer D Organics in Atlanta, which assist in choosing farm sites, building the requisite infrastructure and hiring farmers who work for salary or in exchange for housing and proceeds of whatever they harvest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The interest is so great, we're kind of terrified trying to catch up with all the calls,'' said Quint Redmond, Agriburbia's chief executive. In addition to developers, he hears from homeowners' associations and golf course operators who want to transform their costly-to-maintain green spaces into revenue-generating farms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving the demand, he said, are the local-food movement and the aspirations of many Americans to be gentlemen (or gentlewomen) farmers. ''Everybody wants to be Thomas Jefferson these days,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take L. B. Kregenow, a lawyer who with her husband, David, a doctor, has contracted to build a home in the Skokomish Farms community southwest of Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm a foodie and interested in animal husbandry and cultivating my own wasabi and mushrooms,'' Ms. Kregenow said. But she also likes to travel, which she said makes living in an agrihood ideal. ''For me, the serious downside of farming is doing it on your own means, doing it 365 days a year,'' she said. ''But in this scheme we will have a farm without all the responsibility.''</p>
<p>Erich Schultz, head farmer at Agritopia in Gilbert, Ariz., holds a day-old lamb. Agritopia is one of a growing number of ''agrihoods'' across the country.; Top, Garrett Gruninger, 25, works in the field at  Agritopia. The hub of the community is a small  square overlooking the farm where the market  is open Wednesday night, above. Residents pay  $100 a month for produce, eggs and honey.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long ago, the pink house at 1829 Church Street, in the Glen Park neighborhood here, hit the market for $895,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sold for $1.425 million — $530,000 over the asking price — in less than two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story of this fixer-upper, with three bedrooms, two baths, linoleum floors and an Eisenhower-era kitchen, is in some ways the story of the moment in this city, where longtime residents complain that Silicon Valley money is basically ruining the place for everyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More wealth is concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area than just about any other place in the nation. <span class="companylink">Google</span> alone, the story goes, minted 1,000 millionaires when it went public. Ditto Facebook. And <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>? Some estimate 1,600. Tech worker bees are doing just fine, too, with average base salaries now north of $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand how all this money is transforming San Francisco, for better and worse, look no further than this city’s hyperventilating real estate market. As technology companies have moved in — more than 5,000 start-ups now make their home here — the influx of well-paid workers has pushed rents and home prices through the roof. Making matters worse, San Francisco has also become a bedroom community for many of the young people who work in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each day, Apple, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Google</span> and other tech companies shuttle tens of thousands of their employees to work using private buses that have become a controversial symbol of rising tech wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a recent open house at 1829 Church Street, the broker explained the dilapidated property’s appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘It’s a block away from all the tech shuttles,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one level, the technology industry and its riches have been very good to San Francisco. The unemployment rate here is 4.8 percent, compared with 6.6 percent nationwide. Entire neighborhoods are being revitalized — or destroyed, depending on whom you talk to. To some, San Francisco is losing its soul as it gentrifies rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is reason to worry. Over the last decade, 75,000 people have moved to San Francisco, but only 17,000 new housing units have been built. Over the next 25 years, city officials project, 150,000 more people will move here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The city is surrounded by water on three sides, and there is nowhere for people to go,’’ said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, an online real estate brokerage firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little wonder, then, that a feeding frenzy is underway in the housing market. Landon Nash, a real estate broker here, said it was not uncommon for open houses to draw hundreds of people and to conclude with twenty of them in a bidding war. People are waiving mortgage contingency clauses and home inspections — and paying cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, almost 40 percent of the home sales were all cash. Redfin estimates that on average, homes here are selling for 60 percent to 80 percent over asking price. Most are gobbled up within 16 days of being listed, down from 61 days five years ago, when the nation’s real estate market was still soft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here’s the problem: As more people move in, the city will also need more schoolteachers, police officers and firefighters. Living here on a city salary is difficult, if not impossible. According to Redfin, not a single home on the market in San Francisco County is within the reach of the average public school teacher, who earns $59,700 a year. For police officers, who earn an average of $80,000 a year, there is one affordable home. Five years ago, police officers and teachers could afford 36 percent of the homes on the market, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some tech entrepreneurs and programmers say they are being priced out. They are competing with co-workers who got in early on a tech start-up, or started one of their own, and have seemingly unlimited money at their disposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mark E. Zuckerberg bought his pied-à-terre in San Francisco’s Noe Valley in 2012, he had a representative knock on the door of the home he liked — it wasn’t even for sale — and then he offered the owners all cash at double the value of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Tuesday, 250 San Francisco residents congregated at Virgil’s Sea Room, a bar in the Mission district, to discuss the housing crisis. It didn’t take long for the event, called Tech Workers Against Displacement Happy Hour, to erupt into an expletive-fueled yelling match between tech workers and people running nonprofits that are trying to stop evictions in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials know they have a housing problem on their hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Our approach to housing in San Francisco is very dysfunctional,’’ said Scott Wiener, a San Francisco supervisor who is a proponent of new housing. ‘‘The system is intentionally designed to make it as difficult as possible to build new housing.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are long lists of rules, regulations and hurdles that developers need to get around before building in the city that Mr. Wiener said were created to curb new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate experts say the only way to build is up, but many longtime residents have shot down proposals for high-rise housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, with each new housing unit, there need to be affordable options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the <span class="companylink">Public Policy Institute of California</span> and the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality, more than 23 percent of San Francisco residents are below the poverty threshold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, officials have managed to approve some new high-rise housing in the South of Market and Tenderloin areas. But it seems to be too little, too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘We’re in an absolute housing crisis right now,’’ Mr. Wiener said. ‘‘There’s no easy solution, and it’s going to take us time to fix this.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As published in the International New York Times</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDSAN FRANCISCO -- Not long ago the pink house at 1829 Church Street, in the Glen Park neighborhood here, hit the market for $895,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sold for $1.425 million -- $530,000 over the asking price -- in less than two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story of this fixer-upper, with three bedrooms, two baths, linoleum floors and an Eisenhower-era kitchen, is in some ways the story of the moment in the city, where longtime residents complain that Silicon Valley money is basically ruining the place for everyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More wealth is concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area than just about any other place in the nation. <span class="companylink">Google</span> alone, the story goes, minted 1,000 millionaires when it went public. Ditto <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. And <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>? Some estimate 1,600. Tech worker bees are doing just fine, too, with average base salaries now north of $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand how all this money is transforming San Francisco, for better and worse, look no further than this city's hyperventilating real estate market. As technology companies have moved in -- more than 5,000 start-ups now make their home locally -- the influx of well-paid workers has pushed rents and home prices through the roof. Worsening matters, San Francisco has also become a bedroom community for many of the young people who work in Silicon Valley. Each day, Apple, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Google</span> and others shuttle tens of thousands of their employees to work using private buses that have become a controversial symbol of rising tech wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a recent open house for 1829 Church Street, the broker explained the property's dilapidated appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a block away from all the tech shuttles,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one level, the technology industry and its riches have been very good to San Francisco. The unemployment rate is 4.8 percent, compared with 6.6 percent nationwide. Entire neighborhoods are being revitalized -- or destroyed, depending on whom you talk to. To some, San Francisco is losing its soul as it gentrifies rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is reason to worry. Over the last decade, 75,000 people have moved to San Francisco, but only 17,000 new housing units have been built. Over the next 25 years, city officials project, 150,000 more people will arrive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The city is surrounded by water on three sides, and there is nowhere for people to go,'' said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, an online real estate brokerage firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little wonder, then, that a feeding frenzy is underway in the housing market. Landon Nash, a real estate broker, said it was not uncommon for open houses to see hundreds of people shuffle through and conclude with a 20-person bidding war. People are waiving mortgage contingency clauses and home inspections -- and paying cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, almost 40 percent of the home sales were all cash. Redfin estimates that, on average, 60 percent to 80 percent of San Francisco homes are selling for prices over the original asking price. Most are gobbled up within 16 days of being listed, down from 61 days five years ago, when the nation's real estate market was still soft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here's the problem: As more people move in, the city will also need more public-school teachers, police officers and firefighters. Living in San Francisco on a city salary is difficult if not impossible. According to Redfin, in San Francisco County, where the average teacher earns $59,700 a year, not a single home now on the market is within the reach of the average public-school teacher. For police officers, who make an average of $80,000 a year, there is one affordable home. Five years ago, police officers and teachers could have afforded 36 percent of the homes on the market, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some tech entrepreneurs and programmers say they are being priced out. They are competing with co-workers who got in early on a tech start-up, or started one of their own, and have seemingly unlimited money at their disposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mark Zuckerberg bought his pied-à-terre in San Francisco's Noe Valley in 2012, he had a representative knock on the door of the home he liked -- it wasn't even for sale -- and then offered the owners all cash at double the value of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, 250 San Francisco residents congregated at Virgil's Sea Room, a bar in the Mission district, to discuss the housing crisis. It didn't take long for the event, called Tech Workers Against Displacement Happy Hour, to erupt into an expletive-fueled yelling match between tech workers and people running nonprofits that are trying to stop evictions in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials know they have a housing problem on their hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our approach to housing in San Francisco is very dysfunctional,'' said Scott Wiener, a San Francisco supervisor who is a proponent of new housing. ''The system is intentionally designed to make it as difficult as possible to build new housing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are long lists of rules, regulations and hurdles developers need to get around before building in the city that Mr. Wiener said were created to curb new construction. Real estate experts say the only way to build is up, but many longtime residents have shot down proposals for high-rise housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, with each new housing unit, there need to be some affordable options. According to the <span class="companylink">Public Policy Institute of California</span> and the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality, more than 23 percent of San Francisco residents are below the poverty threshold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, officials have managed to approve some new high-rise housing in the SoMa and Tenderloin areas. But it seems to be too little, too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're in an absolute housing crisis right now,'' Mr. Wiener said. ''There's no easy solution, and it's going to take us time to fix this.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a few layers of lath and plaster can stand between two homes in New York City, and still, people may never meet their neighbors. But for apartment dwellers in a crop of new rental towers, it may be hard to remain strangers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting that residents are keen on hanging out with people from down the hall, whether that involves answering emails, celebrating holidays or sunbathing, developers are packing their buildings full of shareable amenity spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This all-in-one approach has existed for a few years but appears to have reached a fever pitch with the Abington House on the High Line, a new rental that raises the amenity bar and also will hit new price heights for the Hudson Yards neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's nice to give people a comfortable way to get to know residents,'' said Daria P. Salusbury, a senior vice president of the Related Companies, the developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters today, especially younger ones, ''are about connectivity,'' Ms. Salusbury said. ''They want to be connected electronically, and they want to be connected humanistically.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Abington House on the High Line, a development from Related and Abington Properties that borders Hudson Yards, has taken this strategy to heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located at 500 West 30th Street, at 10th Avenue, the 33-story red-brick tower has 312 apartments, which range from studios to two-bedrooms. They are finished with oak floors, walnut cabinets and quartz counters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exploiting a sharp westward curve of the park, the building is able to provide striking views from many apartments. On a recent morning, a model unit on the eighth floor seemed to hover almost directly above the High Line, which from that height resembled a ribbon strung between blocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Abington cost $250 million to develop and is expected to open in the spring, with leasing beginning this month. Studios will start at $3,000 a month and two-bedrooms at $5,400, according to Related, though to fill the building, renters will get one month free in the first year. There are also 78 affordable units, mixed throughout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These rents are steep for Hudson Yards, a longtime industrial area that has been slow to add new housing. At Ohm, for example, a five-year-old apartment tower on the same block, has 368 units, 80 of which are affordable, and market rents start at $2,725 a month for studios, with concessions also offered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices, however, are in line with Chelsea, which is the source of much of the migration to the area, so ''Related should be able to achieve those rents,'' said Philip Wharton, the senior vice president for development at <span class="companylink">Brookfield Office Properties</span>, which is working on its own rental tower nearby on West 31st Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Abington, there are 30,000 square feet of amenities. Outside, they include three terraces, with one practically grazing the High Line's railings. Inside is a 4,000-square-foot fitness center in the basement, and nearby, a lounge where five computers will be installed along a wall-mounted shelf. Also, a pair of dark-hued party rooms occupies the ground floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea is that you can live in your apartment but have all these other fabulous spaces for Thanksgiving parties, Super Bowl parties,'' said Benjamin K. Joseph, a Related senior vice president, during a recent tour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gaining access to all these rooms, though, will require a fee. Though it has not yet been set, Ms. Salusbury said that at MiMA, a Related property at 450 West 42nd Street with 44,000 square feet of amenities, it's $1,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But residents who don't pony up will still be able to enjoy the building's capacious lobby, whose selection of materials includes reclaimed wood; riveted metal panels that recall the High Line's girders; and cast concrete, for a pair of benches shaped like dachshunds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also Chinese limestone, for the floor, and it's embedded with fossils, said Clodagh, the single-named designer who styled the amenity spaces and the lobby; she pointed out what looked like a leaf, triangular and veined, embedded in the floor by the reception desk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside, the building, which has 6,400 square feet of storefronts and entrances on both 30th and 29th streets, sports a more traditional look, courtesy of Robert A. M. Stern Architects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the firm is perhaps best known recently for 15 Central Park West, the wildly successful luxury condominium developed by a team that included Zeckendorf Development, Robert A. M. Stern Architects and Related have had a prolific relationship. In Manhattan, they have teamed up for seven other residential buildings, starting with Tribeca Park, a 396-unit rental in Battery Park City that opened in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental building that Brookfield is working on, at 425 West 31st Street, near 10th Avenue, is a 60-story tower with 830 apartments that will start construction this year and be completed in 2017. And it, too, will be loaded with amenity spaces, with pet day care, terraces and a pool across 40,000 square feet, Mr. Wharton of Brookfield said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he added, there's a trade-off: His building will sacrifice apartment space to squeeze in all these extras.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Abington may not be tops in terms of amenity space size in Manhattan, though; Mercedes House, at 11th Avenue and West 53rd Street with 546 apartments, has 80,000 square feet, inside and out, said Nancy Packes, a marketing consultant who worked on that rental and several other buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Abington easily beats out two other projects that Ms. Backes has been involved with, she said: New York by Gehry, the rental by the architect Frank Gehry at 8 Spruce Street in Lower Manhattan, which has 23,000 square feet, including plazas, as well as Ohm, whose 15,000 square feet includes a video arcade where residents can play 1980s favorites like Asteroid and Centipede.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Ms. Packes, amenities, besides giving people places to throw birthday bashes, confer pride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People ask two things when they talk. 'What do you do? And where do you live?' '' she said. ''How many boxes you can check in regards to amenities to some extent gives you bragging rights.''</p>
<p>The red-brick Abington House on the High Line, center, will have 312 rental apartments with high-end finishes, along with numerous amenities, including a lounge in the basement. Leasing at the building, located at 500 West 30th Street bordering Hudson Yards, is set to begin. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY MARILYNN K. YEE/THE NEW YORK TIMES; JANELLE JONES FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) </p>

</div><div class="author">BY FLOYD NORRIS   </div><div>481 words</div><div>1 March 2014</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>15</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six years after the recession began, the United States has yet to return to where it was by any of three measures of economic activity: jobs, highway miles driven or house prices. That makes this business cycle unique among recent cycles — within four years of the recessions that began in 1981, 1990 and 2001, each of those indicators was up substantially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But within the current slow recovery over all, there is a wide gap in the performance of individual states, as can be seen in the accompanying charts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The indicators cover different areas of activity. The job count is an obvious measure of economic activity, and highway miles driven reflect how many people are driving to work each day, as well as how much is being shipped to stores. Home prices are critical in the current cycle, because that was the area most directly affected by the credit crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the top of all three measurements is North Dakota, a small state that has been transformed by the shale oil boom. Employment has soared by more than 25 percent, pushing up housing prices by almost a third. And the number of miles driven on the state’s highways is up by about a fifth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the bottom of the list, which is based on combining all three indicators for each state, is Florida. It is among the bottom 10 in each category, although it is not the worst in any of them. Nevada is at the bottom in terms of jobs and home prices, but perhaps oddly, the increase in driving has been greater there than in any state other than North Dakota. New York, on the other hand, has the largest decline in driving but is in the top 10 for job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, the government released its state-by-state measurements of home prices in the fourth quarter of 2013, as well as its estimates of highway miles driven in December. The mile rankings are based on comparisons for the entire years of 2007 and 2013, offsetting temporary weather factors that can influence any one month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, 18 states now have more jobs than they did when the recession began. There are 15 states with higher home prices and 23 where more miles are being driven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The energy industry has been an important factor in most of the states that have done the best in adding jobs, and it has also played an important role in supporting home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs of recovery in other areas. In 2013, the largest increases in home prices came in Nevada, California and Arizona — states where property values boomed and then collapsed. Florida and Nevada were also among the leaders in new jobs last year, although they are still well below prerecession levels in employment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KEITH BRADSHER   </div><div>1453 words</div><div>26 February 2014</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>16</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vast steel mill here on the south bank of the Pearl River was supposed to have closed more than three years ago, its labyrinth of rusty chutes and sheds bulldozed and its massive cranes with huge steel claws dismantled for scrap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Guangzhou Steel mill continued churning out millions of tons of steel for construction projects across Southeast Asia all the way through last September, when the antiquated complex, built on Mao’s orders in the late 1950s, finally began shutting down. Even now, a small fraction of the previously 6,000-member work force continues to shape specialty products for export and the domestic market, while furnaces at a much newer mill to the south churn out higher-grade steel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent history of the old mill underscores two troubles in the Chinese economy: its heavy dependence on construction in recent years and now the return, at least temporarily, of a need for exports to help offset weakness in the domestic market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese stocks continued their slide on Tuesday over concerns that China’s debt-fueled real estate boom is finally slowing — and with it, the country’s sprawling construction industry, which accounts for nearly a fifth of economic output. The falling currency is only adding to the jitters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday and Tuesday, the CSI 300 index of big companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets has lost more than 4.5 percent, with even steeper declines among real estate developers. The weakness follows the government announcement on Monday that real estate prices were not rising as quickly and the state news media reports that banks were limiting or delaying some categories of real estate loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As worries have accumulated about the real estate sector, exports have leapt this winter despite a continued rise in blue-collar wages. With economies in the West starting to recover, executives like Jim He, export manager of the Foshan Monalisa Industry Company, a ceramic tile manufacturer on the western outskirts of Guangzhou, once again see the future in overseas markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Around 80 percent of our sales are to the domestic market, and we have seen a decline in our business recently, given the slowdown in construction projects,’’ he said. ‘‘We are now expanding our export business to countries in Southeast Asia and in South America.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising Chinese exports may be helping to offset emerging signs of weakness across the broader Chinese economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An early reading of the <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>/Markit survey for February of manufacturers’ purchasing managers in China, released last week, showed improvement in new export orders and declines in every other category, including overall business sentiment, employment and industrial production. That was consistent with the weakness of most economic statistics for China in January except exports, which rose 10.6 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But strengthening Chinese exports may lead to further trade tensions, particularly ahead of midterm congressional elections in the United States in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘As their economy slows, they are going to flood the U.S. with more and more of their excess capacity,’’ said Leo Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers union. ‘‘That will be felt all across the country, and politicians in steelmaking districts this election year will have to answer for why their government isn’t doing more.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">China’s central bank</span> has begun quietly helping the country’s exports. It has unsettled traders by intervening heavily in currency markets for the past week, pushing the renminbi down steadily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the fall continued, bringing the currency’s loss against the dollar for the year so far to 1 percent. By comparison, the renminbi rose 3 percent against the dollar last year. The recent decline also interrupts what had seemed to be a steady rise in the Chinese currency that had been eroding the competitiveness of Chinese exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gain in exports last month from a year earlier was particularly surprising because exports a year ago had been overstated. Many Chinese companies inflated the value of their shipments to bypass currency controls and bring capital covertly into the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Chinese government officials and Western economists believe that excessive invoicing has since faded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘We cannot rule out the possibility that a few companies conducted illicit transactions, but on the whole, the export growth number is reasonable and logical if you look at breakdown figures for different commodities and destination markets,’’ Shen Danyang, the Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman, said at a recent news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China’s exports to the United States have been rising this winter in a long list of categories, including steel, knit apparel, kitchen cabinets and toys. Shipments to the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> have risen for goods like shoes and smartphones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the most recent month for which data is available, China’s overall exported tonnage of structural steel for buildings, including products made at the Guangzhou Steel mill, leapt 18.9 percent from a year earlier. A major recipient of that steel was the Bahamas, where Chinese companies are building large hotels and other projects. Chinese exports of structural steel also increased sharply to Japan, the United States and Indonesia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While exports are important to many companies, growth in overseas sales cannot fully offset slower growth in investment spending, which has expanded to almost half the economy as the state-owned banking system and a loosely regulated shadow banking system have churned out loans over the past five years at a blistering pace. Many industrial companies in China complain that excess capacity from previous overinvestment is now stunting their profitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Orders are down due to more competitors coming into the field — we can only get orders if we give very attractive pricing, but this in effect puts even more pressure on our margins,’’ said Tom Zhao, a salesman at the Renqiu North Communication Equipment Company, a satellite dish manufacturer in Renqiu, near Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China’s leaders hope that consumer spending can start to replace investment projects. But consumer spending depends at least partly on perceptions that apartments, the main asset of middle-class and wealthy families, are continuing to increase in price or at least hold their value. Any doubt on that assumption quickly sends shivers through the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A national survey of prices in 70 cities released on Monday showed that prices fell in January compared with December in six cities for new homes and in 13 for existing homes. In the rest, prices continued to rise but tended to do so a little more slowly than in previous months. In Beijing, for example, new-home prices rose 0.4 percent last month from the previous month, after climbing 0.6 percent in December from November. Prices for newly built residential real estate are still up 14.7 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices are already so high that first-time buyers are largely excluded from the market. Even a one-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of a large city can cost two decades’ worth of salary for a young engineer. White-collar salaries have been stagnant or falling because of a glut of college graduates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimists in China say that construction will continue and can absorb the output of a steel sector that has grown tenfold in the last 12 years, to the point that China now consumes half the world’s iron ore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harley Seyedin, the president of the <span class="companylink">American Chamber of Commerce</span> in South China, said he was driving on the outskirts of Guangzhou last month and found himself traveling parallel to an eight-lane highway and a light-rail system under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Where the stations will eventually be, I saw these mini cities popping up,’’ he said, adding that although he was an hour’s drive from the city center, ‘‘with that light-rail system, you can be in downtown Guangzhou in 15 minutes.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet steel prices have also been sliding slowly but steadily in China since last August, a sign that supply is outpacing demand. The tonnage of Chinese steel exports to the United States was flat through most of last year, but it leapt 31 percent in December compared with a year earlier as American steel prices stayed relatively high and the United States economy began gathering steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strengthening American economy makes it harder for companies to bring anti-dumping or anti-subsidy complaints. Winning such cases requires companies to show harm, and this is difficult when businesses are profitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gerard, the union president, predicted that it would take a while for the latest increase in Chinese exports to bring a legal response in the West. ‘‘By then,’’ he said, ‘‘a lot of the damage will have been done.’’</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHARLES V. BAGLI   </div><div>714 words</div><div>26 February 2014</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>21</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Canadian investment firm has agreed to pay $575 million for a 33-story office tower at Park Avenue and 57th Street in the latest indication of a soaring real estate market spurred by foreign investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tower, 450 Park Avenue, is in Midtown East, a neighborhood where chic retailers pay some of the highest rents in the world and developers are now erecting tall, slim buildings with $95 million condominiums. The sale price for 450 Park, whose tenants include hedge funds, private equity companies and law firms, represents a remarkable comeback for a building that last sold for a record $509 million in 2007, a year before the market collapsed after a debt-fueled real estate boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Oxford Properties Group</span>, the real estate arm of the <span class="companylink">Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System</span>, emerged from a hotly contested auction on Monday evening to sign a contract to buy the building from Somerset Partners and the Michael Tabor family trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be one of the highest prices ever paid for a Manhattan office building, over $1,700 per square foot. But Oxford is betting that the property will become more valuable when the developer Harry B. Macklowe completes the tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere, a 1,398-foot skyscraper next door at 432 Park Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's one of those irreplaceable locations,'' Dan Fasulo, a managing director of Real Capital Analytics, said. ''This could be a unique deal where both the seller and the buyer end up winning.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of the trophy tower at 450 Park follows other high-profile deals last year that attracted bidders from around the world, including the $1.1 billion sale of the Sony Building on Madison Avenue, the $1.36 billion sale of 650 Madison Avenue and the $1.54 billion sale of 7 Times Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of pension funds, Asian companies, sovereign funds and other investors are increasing their allocations for real estate,'' said Douglas L. Harmon of Eastdil Secured, the broker on the Park Avenue deal. ''If you do that, the first place you want to be is Manhattan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oxford has been an active investor in New York. The company is a partner with Related Companies in a $15 billion commercial and residential development over the rail yards on the West Side of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese companies, like <span class="companylink">Fosun International</span>, which bought Chase Manhattan Plaza last year for $725 million, have gotten a lot of attention. But Canadian companies, Mr. Fasulo said, are by far the most active foreign buyers in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fate of 450 Park did not always look so good. Somerset and Mr. Tabor set a record -- the highest price on a square-foot basis -- in summer 2007 when they paid $509 million for the 334,404-square-foot building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next year, the economy collapsed, severely wounding most investors who had bought buildings with mostly borrowed money at the height of the real estate boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But unlike other buyers, Keith Rubenstein, a principal at Somerset, said his company had borrowed only 30 percent of the purchase price for the deal. They had poured most of their profits from the 2007 sale of 85 10th Avenue for $425 million, $136 million more than they had paid in 2005, into the purchase of 450 Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rubenstein said the company then bought out the leases of its small retail tenants and then signed a lucrative deal with the auction house Phillips de Pury &amp; Company to lease all of the ground floor space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, Somerset brought in Mr. Harmon, Adam Spies and Kevin Donner from Eastdil to handle the sale of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harmon's team is on a roll, having sold the Sony Building, 650 Madison and the office space at Time Warner Center. Ultimately, more than a half-dozen finalists bid for 450 Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We survived because we only had 30 percent leverage,'' Mr. Rubenstein said. ''It turned out to be one of the best investments we ever made.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price gains slowed in December, according to a closely watched housing survey released on Tuesday that underscored a loss of momentum in the housing recovery. Another report showed that consumer confidence drifted lower in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price index for 20 cities rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent in December, compared with a 0.9 percent rise in November. For the 12 months to December, prices were up 13.4 percent, below the peak of 13.7 percent in November and the first decline in the rate of change since June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Recent housing data has shown that activity at the outset of 2014 has slowed,'' economists with the investment firm Jefferies economists said in a note regarding the Case-Shiller gauge. ''It is possible that the index has reached a near-term top.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent data has shown the housing recovery losing steam in the early part of the year. Housing starts dropped 16 percent in January, the biggest decline in almost three years, and home resales slid to a year-and-a-half-year low last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bitter cold and snowstorms this winter have been blamed in part for the weakness in the housing sector, though analysts say higher mortgage rates and low inventories have hurt as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Reuters poll showed that home price inflation, as measured by the Case-Shiller index, was expected to slow to less than 7 percent this year as mortgage rates rise and as a gradual transition from a market driven by institutional buyers looking for bargains takes place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer sentiment survey on Tuesday suggested that Americans were wary of future economic conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence slipped in February, according to the private sector report by the Conference Board, an industry group. The board said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 78.1 from 79.4 in January, a downward revision. ''While expectations have fluctuated over recent months, current conditions have continued to trend upward,'' Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Severe cold weather and a shortage of houses on the market pushed home resales to an 18-month low in January, the latest indication that economic activity has hit a soft patch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors[http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2014/02/existing-home-sales-drop-in-january-while-prices-continue-to-grow] said on Friday that home sales dropped 5.1 percent last month to an annual rate of 4.62 million units, the lowest level since July 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group said unseasonably cold weather was partly to blame, but it also acknowledged some fundamental weakness in the market, with higher mortgage rates and prices and fewer homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the group’s chief economist, said, “We cannot ignore the ongoing headwinds of tight credit, limited inventory, higher prices and higher mortgage interest rates.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is about a full percentage point higher than it was a year ago, even though rates have come down a bit since hitting a two-year high in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales tumbled in the Northeast, South and Midwest, which were hit by snow storms and ice last month. And they were down 7.3 percent in the West, an indication that other factors apart from the weather also weighed on sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales, which peaked in July, have declined in five of the last six months, and in January were down 5.1 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the inventory of unsold homes on the market rose 2.2 percent from December, pushing the supply to 4.9 months. While that was up from December’s 4.6 months, it remained below the 6.0 months that analysts consider a healthy balance between supply and demand. The median price for a previously owned home rose 10.7 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers accounted for 26 percent of the transactions, the smallest share since the group started tracking the series in October 2008. A market share of 40 to 45 percent is considered ideal by economists and real estate professionals.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the universe of ultraluxury real estate, much attention has been lavished on foreign investors who pay record prices for glassy Midtown condominiums, and the wave of previously staunch uptown residents suddenly spending big to embrace unlikely neighborhoods in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now get ready for a new group of well-to-do buyers who are quickly gaining momentum: under-40 multimillionaires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such buyers care less about status and amenities than quality, character and privacy. They eschew Park Avenue for Canal Street, and prefer bespoke kitchens by the British designer Smallbone of Devizes to the typical Sub-Zero style. The young wealthy elite is split between entrepreneurs, who have made their fortunes in technology and business, and those who have family money. But nearly all prefer homes downtown, and they almost always pay all cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have a completely different DNA from the rest of us,'' said Robert Dankner, the president of Prime Manhattan Residential, a brokerage that represents young tech millionaires. ''They like to stay under the radar, and the time and energy others spend to conform, these people spend forging their own path. What is important to them is to have something that is not like what everyone else has.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buildings that have been currying favor among this set include the Sterling Mason in TriBeCa, 200 Eleventh Avenue in Chelsea and 285 Lafayette Street in SoHo. ''In my experience smaller is better than bigger, buildings like One57 and 15 CPW are not their thing,'' Mr. Dankner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take 471 Washington Street, which began sales in 2010 and sold out before construction was completed. It is on the corner of Canal Street bordering SoHo and northern TriBeCa. Each of the nine apartments in the nine-story building, blocks from where the city Department of Sanitation is erecting an enormous garage and salt shed, boasts outdoor space, a private keyed elevator and 11-foot ceilings. At least four of the buyers in the building are under 40, including Sasha Bikoff, 26, an interior designer. Ms. Bikoff, who grew up in Manhattan, has furnished homes that include Judy Garland's former apartment at the Dakota on the Upper West Side, a former Hunnewell estate in Dover, Mass., and homes in Montauk, Amagansett and Hudson, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She bought a sprawling one-bedroom at 471 Washington that has three levels, a 650-square-foot backyard and a large basement intended as storage, which has been transformed into an office, with tiled floors and walls painted royal blue. The main level has a kitchen and entertainment area where she exhibits her artwork, while the top floor houses her living space. Adjoining Ms. Bikoff's bedroom is an enormous walk-in-closet reminiscent of the one that Mr. Big built for an awed Carrie Bradshaw in the ''Sex and the City'' movie; the space is a reinvention, first built as a second bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything is totally private and separate from each other, sort of like a townhouse within the building,'' said Ariel Dagan, 25, an associate broker at Keller Williams New York City who represents Ms. Bikoff, having known her since both were children on the Upper East Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before buying, Ms. Bikoff was renting a one-bedroom with a terrace in Chelsea. ''But she likes to entertain and it just wasn't large enough,'' Mr. Dagan said, ''plus she wanted something with the feeling of Old New York -- something super, super unique.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find the perfect home, Ms. Bikoff and Mr. Dagan visited several listings from Chelsea all the way to the southern tip of TriBeCa. ''I am the type of person that will walk into Barney's in my sweatpants, I don't care,'' Ms. Bikoff said. ''But at the same time, I am a serious buyer, and I think we went into some of these listings and they didn't take me seriously. That changed after we did the walk-throughs and they saw my comments and knowledge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ms. Bikoff first visited 471 Washington Street, it was still under construction. ''Sasha walked in and from the first moment, looking at just four cement walls, she was like, 'This is it, this is what I want.' '' Mr. Dagan recalled. ''And I was like, 'What? I have no idea what we are even looking at.' But she had vision and the space gave her inspiration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other residents of 471 Washington include two young brothers who each own large apartments and a stylish 30-something couple, Harsh and Purvi Padia. The Padias -- he runs a hedge fund and she has an interior-design business -- paid more than $17 million for the penthouse. The couple, who have a child, were featured in an episode of ''Million Dollar Listing,'' a reality show on Bravo, expressing concern that the 4,200-square-foot unit, which comes with 4,000 square feet of outdoor space and a rooftop pool, was too small for the family of three. They ended up combining the apartment with the unit below, creating a 7,200-square-foot home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The whole building is filled with rich young millionaires,'' said John Gomes, a broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>, who oversaw the sales at 471 Washington Street with his partner Fredrik Eklund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walker Tower, a 47-unit conversion on West 18th Street where a penthouse recently sold for a record-breaking $50.9 million and a two-bedroom recently went into contract for $4.2 million, has also seen an influx of young buyers. ''It used to be that if you were dealing with a buyer who was under 40, it wasn't really in the luxury market,'' said Vickey Barron, an associate broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> and the director of sales at Walker Tower. ''They were looking for a perfectly lovely apartment, but not really luxury. Now I'll see someone walk through the door and assume it is a 37-year-old broker, but it is actually a buyer, and they are looking at a listing that costs $14 million.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the young buyers at Walker Tower is a 30-something owner of a tech company who recently bought a two-bedroom; another resident, a 30-year-old lawyer and entrepreneur, bought a three-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buildings like Walker Tower and 471 Washington Street lack many of the flashier amenities often featured in larger buildings, like golf simulators, giant screening rooms or basketball courts. But that is just fine. ''These younger, successful individuals, they are almost too intelligent to go for the bells-and-whistles sales pitch,'' Ms. Barron said. ''Instead they want substance, they want something that is a good investment and is nice to live in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The architect Cary Tamarkin is seeing a similar trend at two boutique condominiums he is developing in West Chelsea. The buildings, 456 West 19th Street and 508 West 24th Street, have pared down amenities and elevated prices -- the cheapest unit at 508 West 24th Street is $4.15 million -- and seem to be interesting buyers who are executives at technology and new-media companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The mind-set of wildly successful people who are under 40, if you think about what made them that kind of money, it is a pioneering, creative spirit,'' Mr. Tamarkin said. ''They have a lot of self-confidence -- they aren't relying on an address or someone's name to give them that cachet, but rather they are going on their spirit.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos, condos, condos. Sometimes they seem to be all that anybody talks about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But New York is really a rental town: rental apartments, especially in Manhattan, still make up three-quarters of all homes, even as for-sale properties glamorously sprout around them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, most people can't make hefty down payments, and despite the charms of the city, not everybody wants to commit to living in it for more than a couple of lease cycles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For landlords who can play a long game, rentals have been a tantalizing product: demand tends to be high, supply low; rentals can be counted on for a steady stream of monthly income for years. And that stream has seemed to gush as the city's popularity, and population, have grown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet this mighty and famously reliable sector does not appear to be impervious to upset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents have steadily declined across Manhattan over the past few months, according to data from several top brokerages and industry experts, while vacancy rates have predictably swung in the other direction, posting their highest rates in almost a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental market typically swoons a bit in colder months -- who can think about lugging boxes in the face of a polar vortex? Yet the current decline is steeper and more drawn out than in past winters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of sudden, in late September, the market just died,'' said Marc Lewis, the managing chairman of Coldwell Banker AC Lawrence, a brokerage that focuses on rentals. ''There's been a strong drop-off in demand, and landlords have lost a few months' rent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords aren't taking this sitting down. In addition to the freebies they usually dangle to fill new buildings, they are offering deal-sweeteners at pre-existing buildings at a level not seen in years. Examples, according to industry data, include a free month's rent for current tenants and a $200 gift card for brokers who lease apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rental developers, far from expecting any lingering softness in the market, are plowing ahead with new projects, some of them huge, with more than 1,000 units under one roof. They point out that rents achieved record levels early last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going forward, however, the residential real estate business may have to face a changing reality: Rents have been climbing faster than incomes, so the current slowdown may signal that the market is correcting itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The city is not just Wall Street anymore,'' said David Picket, the president of the <span class="companylink">Gotham Organization</span>, a longtime apartment developer. ''It's become much more diversified. But the bad news is that people in those new industries aren't making the same kinds of salaries.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartments in buildings with limited amenities seem to be bearing the brunt of the trend, and units of every size seem affected, from studios to three-bedrooms, according to Coldwell Banker AC Lawrence, which bases its analyses of new leasing activity on a sampling of 150,000 apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take a typical one-bedroom walk-up, for example. In September, it rented for an average of $2,512 a month, the firm's data show, but in October it fell to $2,326, or more than 7 percent. In November there was a further decline of nearly 2 percent, to $2,282, and in December yet another 2 percent slide, to $2,238. Last month, average rents slipped again, according to other firms' data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slackened demand is playing a part, with double-digit drops in new leases this year versus a year ago. Supply, predictably, has increased. In November the vacancy rate in Manhattan, which almost never cracks 3 percent, stood at 2.8 percent, the highest rate since 2006, according to data from <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, the real estate brokerage. And in December, the rate held at 2.79 percent. Though it has dropped a bit since, according to Elliman and other firms, the rate by some measures remains higher than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacancy rate in Manhattan was 1.54 percent in January 2013, according to Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways, what's happening with the rental market may seem paradoxical, a fact that many analysts acknowledge as they scratch their heads and try to come up with explanations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, few apartment buildings have opened in Manhattan, they say, and that lack of supply would normally push rents upward. The fact that they are declining even as the borough adds residents, ostensibly increasing demand, suggests that the weakness in the market may be deeper than it appears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Manhattan's population in 2012 stood at 1.62 million, up from 1.6 million in 2011, and 1.59 million in 2010, according to census data prepared by the sociology department at Queens College.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the college, there are about 582,000 rentals in Manhattan, as opposed to 165,000 owned units, meaning rentals make up 78 percent of the total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But getting an exact handle on the size of the available supply is not easy. Few brokerages track it, and landlords can be notably opaque when it comes to reporting on the status of units in their buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory is also frequently in flux. Many rental apartments in Manhattan are lost every year through conversions to condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measuring new supply can be tricky, too. Broadly speaking, about 4,200 units in multifamily buildings were added in Manhattan in 2013, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, the real estate website, which uses census figures that cover affordable and market-rate apartments but don't differentiate between rental and for-sale apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, nearly 2,400 of the new units were rental, including affordable units, according to Citi Habitats, a brokerage that handles mostly rentals. And 2014 is expected to produce slightly higher numbers: about 3,200 market-rate rental units and 700 affordable units, according to projections from Elliman and Citi Habitats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, in 1985, a peak year, Manhattan added about 12,100 units over all according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>; in 2008, the most active year since then, it welcomed a total of 9,700 apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's rental projects include conversions such as the Centurian at 1182 Broadway and 28th Street, a 39-unit development from Mocal Enterprises. Then there's 160 West 62nd Street, near Amsterdam Avenue, 339 units from Glenwood Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, Inwood will welcome the Stack, at 4857 Broadway, with 28 units ranging from studios to three-bedrooms; the East Village will usher in the 85-unit Nathaniel at 138 East 12th Street, near Third Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants are also moving into the Lara, 113 Nassau Street, a 167-unit building in the financial district. (Developed by the brothers Bernard and Robert Friedman, it is partly named for their mother, Clara Friedman, according to a project spokeswoman, but more directly for Superman's mother, Lara.) With studios starting at $2,700 a month, the building is about 50 percent leased, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers who plan on cutting ribbons on rental projects this year know they are rare birds. Land costs have skyrocketed in the last few years, to the point that prime Manhattan sites can go for $850 a square foot. With rents of $3,000 a month, recouping an investment could take years and years. So building pricey condos and selling them for a hefty $3,000 a square foot often seems the better bet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New rental projects are dinosaurs,'' said David Amirian, a partner at Wonder Works Construction Corporation, which is part of a team developing 316-318 East Third Street, a 33-unit rental in the East Village. ''The only deals that pencil out are condos.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Mr. Amirian's project, which is near Avenue D, the math worked because he was able to take advantage of a special 10-year property-tax break that lowered costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the program that created the tax break ended in 2008, stifling the rental development market, Mr. Amirian said. When leasing begins in May, his one-bedrooms will rent for $2,900 to $3,300 a month, which is in line with the few other new rentals in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when developers can afford to build, renters may find the apartments out of reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2002 and 2011, median rents in the city rose by 19 percent while the median income of households that rent, now around $40,000, declined, according to a recent report from the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That report also found that in 2012, more than half of those households were burdened by housing costs, in that they spent more than 30 percent of monthly income on rent and utilities; for most, rent consumed more than half of income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factors other than overextended renters figure in the slowdown, Mr. Picket of Gotham said. In the weeks after Hurricane Sandy in the fall of 2012, many residents scrambled to find new homes, accounting for an unusual spike in activity. A year later, with some of those leases coming due and more normal dynamics governing the market, ''there's been a reshuffling of the deck,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, Gotham is leasing Gotham West, a major mixed-use project in Hell's Kitchen between West 44th and West 45th Streets. The project has 1,238 units, 554 at market rate and 684 affordable. Since leasing began last August, about 33 percent have rented. Market-rate one-bedrooms start around $3,400 a month. But the leasing pace of about seven deals a week in the early fall slowed to about four deals a week in November and December, Mr. Picket said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More familiar forces may also be at work. Traditionally, the rental market suffers when the sales market improves, with the idea being that renters decide to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And by some measures 2013, particularly the end of it, was a banner buying season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 3,297 deals in the fourth quarter of last year, up 27 percent from the same period a year ago, and the most ever in a fourth quarter in Manhattan, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, who added that ''buyers don't come from thin air, they come from the rental market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he acknowledged that inventory for sale was low in 2013, so that not everybody who wanted to buy something could, especially with the stratospheric prices at many luxury developments. It also continues to be difficult to qualify for a home loan, Mr. Miller said, adding that interest rates, too, are on the rise, Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the rental market is in a rut, it's not because landlords aren't trying. They are offering a flurry of incentives, or concessions, to woo renters. The recent small decline in the vacancy rate that some market-watchers report may indicate a degree of success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, of all rentals listed in late January, about 30 percent were offering some type of concession; that rate is the highest since 2010, at the tail end of the recession, said Douglas Wagner, an agent at Bond New York who oversees leasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concessions are fairly standard in the rush to lease new properties. In early February, the Larstrand, a 181-unit rental developed by Rose Associates and Friedland Properties on the Upper West Side, was offering to cover the broker's fee and one month's rent on a two-bedroom listed at $8,795 a month, according to an email sent to brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a sign of the market's weakness, concessions are also now being offered on older properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week the Fairmont, a 1970s-era Glenwood rental at 300 East 75th Street, was trying to sweeten deals by covering the broker's fee and a month's rent on a 13-month lease, according to another email to brokers. One-bedrooms there start at $2,695 a month, according to Glenwood's website. For landing a tenant, brokers, too, were to be rewarded -- with a $200 gift card.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that there aren't landlords betting that the market's slide will, like those in previous winters, be only seasonal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last few months, some have begun offering leases with unusual terms: contracts signed in December in some cases cover a 16-month period, so that the renewal date falls in the spring, when the rental market is typically stronger, Mr. Wagner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That way, landlords can avoid having to renegotiate in the winter months, and possibly having to charge a lower rent, he added. ''This is a smart move by the developers,'' Mr. Wagner said, ''because they can base their renewal on that historic plateau that we achieved earlier this year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But although the rental market has softened in Manhattan, it remains strong elsewhere in the city. Rents in Brooklyn, which has become a first stop for young people after they graduate from college, are steadily climbing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers continue to place huge bets there. Douglaston Development, which seesaws between rentals and condos depending on which market seems more robust, has two big rentals in the works on the waterfront in Williamsburg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's 1 North Fourth Place, with 509 units, which will hit the market next fall. And Phase 2 of the firm's Edge condo, with 550 units, will open in 2016, according to Jeffrey Levine, the chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar rental upsurge seems to be afoot in Long Island City, Queens, said Jodi Stasse, a managing director of Citi Habitats who handles new-development marketing. Renters there are opting for newer buildings over older ones, she said; this suggests that new development could come at the expense of the rest of the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 41-21 24th Street in Queens, part of the Ciampa Organization's three-building Packard Square project, rents for one-bedrooms start at $2,450. Concessions -- one month free on a 13-month lease -- are being offered on top of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this year continues to be sluggish, both in terms of new rental apartments and leasing activity, 2015 may be much bigger; 7,000 new rental units are currently expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among them, from the Moinian Group, are 1,174 units at 605 West 42nd Street, at 11th Avenue. One-bedrooms in the building, tentatively called Art, will rent around $3,600 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with other projects, the land under Art was acquired in a different market, in 2005, when prices were far lower. But to show his confidence in rentals, Joseph Moinian, the group's chief executive, tweaked the building plan; it will no longer have 200 condo units, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody's dream is to live in the city in an apartment, whether you are graduating from college or getting married or an empty nester or whatever,'' Mr. Moinian said. ''As long we are in an 'in' city, and we have security and the art and safety, apartments will do fine.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Brooklyn neighborhoods grow more expensive and the city's affordability frontier shifts to the Bronx, Bedford Park, in the north-central section of the borough, could become prime territory, being both stable and financially within reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjoining the Mosholu Parkway along the northeast, the New York Botanical Garden to the southeast and the Jerome Park Reservoir to the west, the somewhat arrowhead-shaped half square mile of Bedford Park has attributes that New Yorkers love -- good public transportation, parks and interesting housing stock -- while flying low on the larger real estate radar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers see its prominence increasing as more buyers are priced out elsewhere. ''People are discovering it,'' said Oscar Cabrera of Keller Williams Real Estate, describing the area as one of several in the Bronx he considers ''the last bastions of affordability in New York City.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Sasse, an agent with Veritas Property Management, had similar observations. At open houses for co-ops in Bedford Park, he said, he sees mostly people from other boroughs -- Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn. ''They're saying, 'It's the only place I can afford to buy.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The richest category of housing is the well-priced co-op in an Art Deco building along the northernmost stretch of the Grand Concourse. The area's few single-family homes rarely hit the market, but they date to its late 19th-century origins as a parklike suburb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such home, built in 1903 with seven bedrooms and three baths, was recently available. Mr. Cabrera, who handled the sale, said the property, listed at $375,000, exemplified the value that the neighborhood offers. A comparable property in some parts of Brooklyn might command as much as $900,000, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing also reflected the area's stability, having been inhabited since the early 1980s by a family now returning to Colombia. A neighborhood family that wanted a larger home is in contract to buy it, at close to asking price, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Bedford Park has always maintained itself and has a pretty good name,'' Mr. Cabrera said. ''You can raise a family there and not see dilapidated houses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2010 census, grouping Bedford Park with North Fordham, shows that of nearly 55,000 residents, 68 percent are Hispanic, 18 percent black or African-American, 6.7 percent white and 5 percent Asian. There are a few commercial strips, but none with the bustle of shopping areas like the one a few blocks south on East Fordham Road. Shops and restaurants are in small pockets -- one near Bedford Park Boulevard and Webster Avenue, another at Bedford Park Boulevard and Jerome Avenue, a third along East 198th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses reflect the diverse population. An African market on Bedford Park Boulevard flanks restaurants with Dominican, Mexican and Chinese menus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few Korean shops and restaurants can be found along East 204th Street near Valentine Avenue. Kay Lee, who has owned a Kumon tutoring center at that intersection for 15 years, described the Korean community as smaller now than 10 years ago and said she was seeing more South Asian and Albanian families moving in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One complaint you'll hear in the area: On-street parking can be hard to find.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You'll Find</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory is dominated by one-bedroom co-ops in buildings along the Grand Concourse and on streets that slope down to Webster Avenue. Two- and three-bedrooms are scarce and in demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Browse the online listings for co-ops in Bedford Park and you'll see apartments with architectural accents like rounded doorways and sunken living rooms. Some, in buildings facing the Mosholu, have views of the greenery that lines the parkway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sasse says most of his buyers are couples in their 20s and 30s who hope to start a family or who have a young child. What Bedford Park offers them is the Junior 4s, a one-bedroom with a dining room that can be converted into a small second bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rentals are also a big part of the market. The Tracey Towers on Mosholu Parkway, a pair of hulking high-rises built in the 1970s under the Mitchell-Lama housing program, are icons in Bedford Park. Designed by the architect Paul Rudolph, the buildings are distinctive for their curved lines and concrete construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jean Hill, the president of the Tracey Towers Tenant Association, said a major renovation was underway, both in public areas and within apartments, which are rented at subsidized rates. Ms. Hill said the complex remained a safe, community-oriented place to raise a family, just as it was when she moved there in the mid-1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the neighborhood around them, the towers have undergone demographic shifts. ''It's always been mixed, African-Americans, Europeans, Hispanics,'' Ms. Hill said. ''Now we have a large Ghanaian population.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You'll Pay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Sasse, one-bedroom co-ops range in price from $100,000 to $150,000, depending on the extent of renovations, with the median around $119,000. Two-bedroom co-ops, when available, usually start around $149,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Studios often start around $90,000. Mr. Sasse says some can be had at lower prices if deals are all cash or are part of a pre-foreclosure process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family homes run mainly between $300,000 and $400,000, according to a review of listings on <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span> -- which recently showed 71 listings, including co-ops and condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have not recovered fully from the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. Mr. Sasse cited one listing, a one-bedroom ''bought at height of market'' for $119,000 as having been relisted at $112,000 ''and we might still have to come down a bit, so prices are not back at pre-recession level yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commute</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood is well served by the subway system. Two lines run through Bedford Park -- the B and D trains along the Grand Concourse and the 4 train along Jerome Avenue. A trip to Grand Central Terminal on the 4 from the Bedford Park Boulevard stop takes 35 to 40 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood also has access to the <span class="companylink">Metro-North Railroad</span>. The New York Botanical Garden stop falls within its boundaries; a trip to Grand Central from there takes 22 minutes, according to an online schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to Do</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The botanical garden lies at the easternmost border and puts residents of Bedford Park within walking distance of one of the city's most beautiful green spaces as well as its seasonal programs and special exhibits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More parkland is accessible along the Moshulu Parkway, where residents can walk their dogs, jog or find a quiet spot on a park bench. The Bronx Zoo is a short bus ride away. For cultural events, Bedford Park isn't far from the Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, on the campus of Lehman College. Among the acts scheduled to perform this month were the Soweto Gospel Choir and the Haifa Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just southwest of the area, the morphing of the Kingsbridge Armory into a national ice skating center by 2017 is being anticipated as a big lure, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Schools</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood is rich with educational institutions. There are two top public high schools -- the Bronx High School of Science, with about 3,000 students, and the High School for American Studies at Lehman College, with 700. Admission is determined by test, and students come from all over the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Department of Education, Bronx Science SAT averages in 2012 were 632 in reading, 688 in math and 649 in writing, versus 434, 461 and 430 citywide that year. Lehman's were 636, 648 and 636.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main public elementary school, No. 8, which runs through Grade 5, got an A on its most recent progress report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The History</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2009, Bedford Park has had a historic district on Perry Avenue: a distinctive group of Queen Anne-style rowhouses. Completed in 1912 at a cost of $6,500 per home, according to the <span class="companylink">Landmarks Preservation Commission</span>, the nine buildings are all elevated on fieldstone walls that enclose small front yards.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Jonah Landman’s Brooklyn, or at least on his blog, house hunting is ferocious and fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers hunt “unicorns” — the deals that are too good to possibly exist — and “take down” brownstones as if they were buffalo on the plains. The house you’ve been circling, ready to pounce on? It’s already gone, snatched up by another buyer in a frenzy of action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Landman, 32, is the voice of BK to the Fullest[http://bktothefullest.blogspot.com/], a niche blog that offers numbers-heavy commentary on the real estate market in brownstone Brooklyn, where inventory is scant and million-dollar-plus sales are the rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is smart and opinionated, part contrarian and part hype man, dismissing Park Slope — “Who came down from the heavens and said that is the only place worth living?” — and championing emerging neighborhoods like Crown Heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What gives the blog its edge, though, are the properties he brings to the surface: houses that exist outside the force field of the big brokerages, the Corcorans, the Halsteads and the Ellimans. He finds listings that are under the radar, even off-market, that do not bubble up on websites like StreetEasy, and often posts closing notices after the fact, teasing readers with a deal they missed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He’s got his feelers out there,” said Jonathan Butler, the founder of the real estate blog Brownstoner[http://www.brownstoner.com/]. “He’s definitely in it, and he gets some good stuff.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Landman is not just an observer of the market. In the three and a half years since he began publishing BK to the Fullest, he has also become a player, positioning himself as a consultant to buyers looking for deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clients — or “platinum members,” as he calls them on the blog — pay $200 an hour, with a 10-hour minimum, for his counsel on topics like the history of individual properties and bidding strategy. His customers run the gamut from first-time home buyers to experienced investors looking for commercial properties. Mr. Landman works to connect them directly to sellers or their brokers, sometimes giving them a chance to bid before the listing even comes out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Occasionally he discovers properties simply by operating on the ground, spotting “For Sale” signs posted on parlor windows. More often, he is tipped off by sellers’ brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a symbiotic relationship. Mr. Landman can help small brokers without flashy websites market their listings to an audience, and his clients tend to arrive without their own brokers. In that situation, the seller’s broker collects the entire commission, which can run up to 5 percent or 6 percent of the sale price, without having to split it with another broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Landman does not have a broker’s or agent’s license in New York and therefore acknowledges that his methods fall in a legal gray area. He does not collect commissions on sales, but the question of whether his upfront fee could be defined as a kind of commission is an open one. So is whether he is effectively listing real estate when he connects clients to the seller of an off-market property. He does not negotiate on behalf of clients, but sometimes the seller’s broker will “whisper the price to beat” to Mr. Landman or clients in the midst of a bidding war, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York Department of State, which oversees real estate licensing, has not received any complaints about Mr. Landman, said Laz Benitez, a spokesman for the department. Emphasizing that he does not know the specifics of Mr. Landman’s operation, Mr. Benitez said that his kind of work “does indeed fall into broker activity.” He added, “If anyone collects a fee or commission by effecting or negotiating the sale of real estate property in New York State, that person would need to be licensed as a real estate broker.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Landman said he believes his role in deals does not go far enough to require a license.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I feel like I’ve come up with a pretty cool way to stay within the rules,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For frustrated buyers, the thought of getting a leg up on the competition — for instance, that tip about a townhouse coming on the market that most of the house-hunting public will never know exists — can be tantalizing. “You can’t buy something you don’t know is for sale,” Mr. Landman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before she hired Mr. Landman, Skye Parrott and her boyfriend had already had a few house offers fall through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I thought, ‘This is crazy,'  ” she said. “  'There has to be a better way to do this.'  ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Parrott conferred with Mr. Landman on properties she found; he also sent her listings he gleaned from his contacts. Thanks to Mr. Landman, she said, she and her boyfriend had offers accepted on four homes, and went to contract on one, the house they ultimately purchased in Crown Heights. “I learned a lot about how we should be bidding,” Ms. Parrott said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consulting business is now Mr. Landman’s full-time job, an unexpected turn for an <span class="companylink">Oberlin College</span> graduate from St. Louis who moved to New York City to become a public-school teacher. He then worked in the <span class="companylink">Macy’s</span> corporate offices and at an architecture firm, along with a stint as a licensed broker in Florida. His appetite for real estate developed when he first moved to the city in 2003, and was struck by sticker shock for his rental on a rat-infested block in Morningside Heights in Upper Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Landman decided to work toward buying a house, and by the time he started the blog, in 2010, his own real estate deal had fallen through; he was supposed to close on a property in East Harlem in 2008, just as <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, the site was a hobby. “I started the blog as my personal diary of ‘I know about these houses. I know about this industry,'  ” he said. He started taking clients a few months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The readership is small, about 500 visitors per day, but BK to the Fullest is now a calling card for Mr. Landman’s services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides potential clients and Brooklyn real-estate addicts, readers include brokers like Celeste Moses, the owner of Prospective Properties[http://www.prospectiveprop.com/Celeste_G._Moses_REALTOR.shtml], which operates primarily in Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has a continuing professional relationship with Mr. Landman, sometimes informing him of her listings and also letting him know when a deal closes, so he can report on it. But she also uses the blog as a resource. “If a property on there closes for a high amount, it gives me a sense, if I have a seller, of how to price their property,” Ms. Moses said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Landman moved this month from a rental apartment with roommates in Prospect Heights into a limestone house in Crown Heights that he bought with relatives for $1.22 million. He heard about it, not surprisingly, from a broker source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is often asked, he said, why he doesn’t get a New York broker’s license himself. “I would make more money if I were a broker,” Mr. Landman said. “But my access to information” — the listings from other brokers that set him apart — “would immediately stop.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a city of soaring real estate prices, New Yorkers love to hear the tales of people who found the Promised Land: a truly affordable apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such places are the stuff of city lore: a three-bedroom in Manhattan that rents for less than $1,000 a month; a Lower East Side one-bedroom that cost a mere $2,000; an East Village co-op with maintenance charges of $545 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The children who grow up in these treasured homes, either rent-regulated apartments or limited-equity co-ops --which go for a fraction of what they are worth on the open market, to buyers who agree to a similar discount when they sell -- can have an inside track. Some get their names on a waiting list for a home at the earliest opportunity. Others have the coveted right of succession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holding onto such a New York City real estate prize into the next generation often requires foresight and its own kind of sacrifice, but those who have managed to do so say that the apartments can provide much more than shelter: their very affordability can shape the arc of a tenant or owner's life. In a city where people move frequently, these tenants share the experience of living their entire lives in a single building. And while peers struggle to pay rent, they make professional choices uninfluenced by the high price of housing, but shaped instead by the home they've always had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, Josh Schaffner's parents left their rent-regulated apartment in Inwood for a limited-equity co-op elsewhere in Manhattan. Mr. Schaffner, then 25, marched straight into the office of the Inwood property management company. For hours, managers pored over his file box, which was stuffed with years of bank statements, credit-card statements, tax returns and cellphone bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, management handed him his parents' lease with their names scratched out and his written in their place. Rent for the three-bedroom apartment in an elevator building was less than $1,000 a month. Mr. Schaffner had anticipated the event for years. Knowing that eventually his parents would leave his childhood home, he had meticulously kept residency records so that he could meet the burden of proof to claim succession rights: The apartment had to have been his primary residence for at least two years, and he had to be a family member.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What other 25-year-old keeps a file box of every statement, every tax return?'' Mr. Schaffner said. ''I felt like I had been working toward something and I'd finally won it, which is a weird feeling to have, because it's a place to live -- it shouldn't be something you win.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the average rent for a three-bedroom apartment in Inwood is $2,550 a month, as it was in January, according to MNS, an apartment for less than $1,000 a month is a prize -- and one that families fight to keep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incentive to stay put offers a real financial reward: New Yorkers who had lived in the same apartment for more than five years as of 2012 paid a median monthly rent of $1,057, substantially less than the $1,444 paid by people who had moved recently, according to data provided by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy of <span class="companylink">New York University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parents living in limited-equity co-ops, such as Mitchell-Lama buildings, add their children to waiting lists years before they will need an apartment. And families in rent-regulated apartments plan for their children to claim the lease eventually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was impressed upon me and my sister that we would want to put our names on as many Mitchell-Lama lists as possible,'' Mr. Schaffner said. ''If we ever wanted a place of our own, we would have to go through the New York channels that we were trained in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schaffner's sister now owns a studio apartment in a Mitchell-Lama limited-equity co-op on the Upper West Side. She bought it for $30,000 in 2012, a decade after she had begun putting her name on various waiting lists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such opportunities are becoming rare, as more apartments are deregulated and as affordable-housing programs are phased out and the units converted to market rate. Between 2002 and 2012, the number of rent-regulated apartments in the city dropped by 8 percent, a loss of 87,820 units, according to the Furman Center. During the same period, six Mitchell-Lama co-op buildings, with a total of 3,432 limited-equity units, left the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Bill de Blasio, who made the shortage of housing for working-class New Yorkers a campaign issue, has said he hopes to build or preserve 200,000 affordable units over the next 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even for those fortunate enough to be born into low-cost housing, waiting lists can last for years and the various programs have different qualification requirements. Rent-regulation comes with guidelines for succession, and limited-equity co-ops have their own rules as well. Many of these programs have income limits, with surcharges billed to high earners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I remember people getting on the list,'' said Dorie Paparo, a freelance writer who grew up on the Lower East Side in East River Housing, a limited-equity co-op until the late 1990s. ''It was just what people did. Everyone would ask, 'Are you on the list?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1994, when Ms. Paparo was 23, her name came up. For less than $2,000, she bought an 800-square-foot one-bedroom apartment in the complex that had been her lifelong home, and where her mother still lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years later, the complex ended the restrictions. Apartments now sell for market rate -- a one-bedroom sold in December for $449,000. ''It didn't even occur to me how lucky I was,'' Ms. Paparo said. ''It's only looking back that I realized I had this sweet deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What differentiates New Yorkers who live in such situations from their peers is that they can make career choices unencumbered by an outsize housing bill. In 2011, over half of the city's renters paid at least 30 percent of income for rent and utilities, and 31 percent paid more than 50 percent, according to the Furman Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arismendy Feliz and his mother pay $580 a month in maintenance for the one-bedroom co-op they share in the Bronx. His mother bought the apartment for $250 in 1989 through a low-income housing program. Mr. Feliz, 30, bought half of his mother's shares when he turned 18. Over the years, the co-op has become part of Mr. Feliz's professional sphere. An artist, he now runs an artist collective called X Collective out of a vacant studio unit that the co-op owns but has been unable to rent out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For now, it's just continuing to fuel my life and inspire me,'' Mr. Feliz said. ''It's allowing me to do what I'd like to do in terms of being an artist.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Ella Leitner, 40, the $12,000 Lower East Side one-bedroom that her parents bought for her in 1993 in the Seward Park Cooperative, then a limited-equity co-op, made a career in the nonprofit sector possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While her friends spent their 20s hopping from apartment to apartment, Ms. Leitner lived next door to her parents' two-bedroom, watching television with them on Friday nights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It gave me the chance to have the career that I always wanted without having to worry about how I was going to pay my bills,'' Ms. Leitner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, Ms. Leitner married. Her parents retired and moved to Florida, transferring the shares of their apartment to her. She and her husband, who now have two children, combined the units, creating a spacious four-bedroom two-bath apartment with an open floor plan, an up-to-date kitchen and two balconies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seward Park is now a market-rate complex. Of the few four-bedroom apartments available on the Lower East Side, the average price in January was $3.595 million, according to data provided by MNS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resentment can run high among New Yorkers who pay market rate, particularly renters. Depending on how frequently the apartment has changed hands, an identical apartment in the same building can command a vastly different rent. Tensions can also arise within limited-equity co-ops, as some tenants want to preserve the programs while others see the potential gold mine that awaits them if they could sell their homes at market rate. Although some limited-equity programs are permanent, others, such as Mitchell-Lama co-ops, allow shareholders to remove their building from the program after a number of years, a process that includes a two-thirds majority shareholder vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Rent regulation provides affordability to the people who have those apartments,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. ''But it doesn't provide affordability to new residents of New York coming in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 1 million of the 2.2 million rental units in New York City are rent-regulated, according to the Furman Center. However, not all rent-regulated apartments are cheap. Some in less expensive areas can rival the neighborhood's market rate. But in sought-after areas, the difference between a market-rate unit and a regulated one can be huge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are far fewer limited-equity co-ops. In 2012 Mitchell-Lama, the largest limited-equity program in the city, had 66,500 such units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller points to rent regulation as a key factor driving up market-rate rents. With nearly half of the housing stock regulated, landlords charge a premium for what remains, he said. With stakes so high, landlords sometimes offer rent-regulated tenants six-figure buyouts. If they suspect a tenant doesn't have a right to the apartment, they hire private investigators, challenge claims and take cases to court. Rent-regulated tenants who own a modest country house in, say, the Berkshires -- affording it because they pay a relative pittance for rent -- are often the targets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You better have your ducks in order,'' said Steven W. Birbach, the chairman of Carlton Management, ''because you can bet that due to the pot of gold that awaits the owner of that apartment, they are going to be making sure that you've done everything right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, New Yorkers who grew up in neighborhoods that were all but abandoned by landlords in the '70s and '80s now find themselves priced out of the very blocks their families struggled to improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These were the buildings where the front lights were on, the door was locked,'' said Andrew Reicher, the executive director of Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, an advocacy group. ''They helped spur the redevelopment of neighborhoods, and now that the neighborhoods are gentrifying, they are the only affordable buildings that are left.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marcel Torres, 31, has always lived in the same East Seventh Street building. In the 1970s, his grandmother led rent strikes against the landlord for failing to supply heat and maintain the building. Eventually the city took over the property, and in 1991, the tenants bought the building, each one paying $250 for an apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Torres shares an apartment with his father, his 12-year-old sister and his girlfriend; they pay $545 a month for maintenance. He hopes eventually to buy or rent a unit in the building, but worries it may not be easy on a struggling actor's salary. Recently, apartments in the building have sold for close to $400,000, which is far below market rate for the East Village, but more than Mr. Torres can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it was back in the day, and we had known what we know now,'' Mr. Torres said, ''we would have kept every unit in the building.'' Family members bought some, but not all, of the 24 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of Mr. Torres's aunts and uncles live in the prewar building; their presence creates a kind of family compound. Mr. Torres remembers Christmas mornings when the halls would rumble as his cousins ran from door to door in celebration. The basement is lined with paintings, photographs and the skateboards that the Torres cousins rode in the streets as children. The basement community room, with well-worn sofas and a makeshift bar, was recently decorated for Mr. Torres's grandmother's 90th birthday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living one's entire life in the same place can be both comforting and unsettling, with some wondering what it would be like to live in another neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It plays tricks with your memories,'' said Ms. Paparo, now 42. ''I'll walk down the street and get a flash. If I lived elsewhere, I wouldn't have the ghosts of my past jumping into my everyday experiences.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her son learned to ride his bike in the same ball field where she learned, and childhood playmates still live nearby. When Ms. Paparo's mother died last November, neighbors she had known since childhood provided solace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The last few months I've had a different perspective on it,'' she said. ''All of a sudden it was really lovely to have that community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet if you never leave your childhood home, the quirks that irritated you as a child don't leave either. When Mr. Schaffner was a boy, the kitchen sink gurgled without warning -- making a vexing gassy sound that could be stopped only by turning on the faucet. Now, at 29, he finds that bubbling sound still annoys him. Similarly, when Ms. Leitner's parents visit her at the Seward Park Cooperative, her father moves the sugar back to where he stored it when he owned the place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring Mr. Schaffner's fiancée, Offira Gabbay, joined him and his roommate in the Inwood apartment, giving up a cheerful one-bedroom in Brooklyn. The couple had spent months debating which apartment to keep, but there was really never much of a choice. Ms. Gabbay's rent was $1,272 a month for a 450-square-foot space; Mr. Schaffner's was less than $1,000 for a three-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New York is increasingly a difficult, hard place to find reasonable housing,'' said Arlene F. Boop, a lawyer who specializes in tenant rights. ''If you've got one version of it, you're trapped.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As his 30th birthday approaches, Mr. Schaffner has begun to contemplate the possibility that he might spend the rest of his life in the apartment where his parents were married and where he grew up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm plenty happy where I am,'' he said. ''The only reservation that I have is that I never had the choice to go anywhere else .''</p>
<p>MARCEL TORRES  LIVES IN AN  APARTMENT HIS  FAMILY BOUGHT  FOR $250 IN 1991.; The maintenance fee of the  apartment on the Lower East  Side where Marcel Torres lives  with his family is $545 a month.  Also resident in the building  are (top left, front row): his  sister Mia and his grandmother  Alicia; (back row) his  girlfriend, Stepheny Stephens,  and his father, Jose. (RE1); Ella Leitner lives in the Seward  Park Cooperative in downtown  Manhattan with her husband,  Brett, their children, Sasha, 6,  and Zachary, 4, and their dog,  Quincy. Ms. Leitner's original  apartment at Seward Park cost  $12,000 in 1993. Later, her  parents transferred their place  in the building to her; they had  bought it for $3,400 in 1983. The  Leitners then combined the  units to create a spacious  four-bedroom. The building is  now a market-rate complex. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY KARSTEN MORAN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (RE9) </p>
