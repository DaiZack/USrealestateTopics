<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As developers continue to push the story line that New York's luxury residential market is a high-end utopia that shows no signs of slowing, you might consider one seldom-discussed factor that is driving their decisions to build for the wealthiest buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lost amid the record-breaking condo sales in 2012 was a scramble for land not seen since at least 2006, during Manhattan's last real estate bonanza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year property owners sold 158 development sites in Manhattan, up 51 percent from 2011, according to Massey Knakal, a New York property sales company. Of those, owners sold 69 sites in the fourth quarter alone. In dollar terms the volume was $3.12 billion, up 128 percent from 2011,with $1.73 billion sold in the fourth quarter, the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bidding wars behind those sales figures sometimes involved as many as 40 developers battling over a single site, said Bob Knakal, Massey Knakal's chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ballooning prices are giving developers little choice but to focus on building -- or in some cases, converting to -- high-end condos. Doing anything less, in most cases, would be too risky, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fact is, the way the free market is working today, land is just too valuable, so developers can't afford to do anything but build super luxury product,'' Mr. Knakal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be good news for wealthy buyers, many of them foreign, who are demanding the best of the best that New York real estate can offer. But it is not great news for a city starved for affordable housing and more rental units. And it has some real estate experts concerned about how far the legs of the housing resurgence will extend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I worry that if this is all we can develop, how deep is that market?'' said Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a property appraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land in New York is worth more today than at the peak of the market in 2007, Mr. Knakal said. While the average price per square foot for a building lost 38 percent of its value from that time, the average price per square foot for land fell only about 18 percent, he said. Why the discrepancy? Not much land was for sale in 2009 and 2010, as sellers decided to ride out the market downturn and hold on to less sought-after sites, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has changed rather drastically in the past year with the surge in the number of development sites being sold. The big sales have not been confined to Manhattan. Last year Mr. Knakal brokered the $54 million sale of a 2.19-acre South Williamsburg site zoned for residential units. The buyer was the government of China, in what Mr. Knakal said he believed was the first such transaction by a foreign-based buyer outside of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, in one of the largest land deals in years, the billionaire Sheldon Solow sold a parcel of land spanning a full block along the East River, between 35th and 36th Streets at First Avenue, to a consortium led by JDS Development group, for $172 million. The land is zoned for residential use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer plans to build two towers, one with 47 stories and the other with 37, for a total of 830 apartments. It is likely they will be mostly rentals, and the conferral of a tax abatement will require 20 percent to be affordable housing units, said Michael Stern, the managing partner of JDS. ''This particular deal might be an anomaly because of its size and limited bidder pool,'' he added. ''It has become almost impossible to do rentals in Manhattan at these land prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers' struggle to build rental units doesn't bode well for a New York in need of more ''work-force housing'' for teachers, police officers and fire fighters, Mr. Knakal said. ''There are so many millions of people that keep the city functioning,'' he said. ''If you earn $40,000 a year, where do you live? We need new housing for those folks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said the tightness in the property market made the proposed rezoning of Midtown East to allow more tall towers ''very important to the future of real estate development in the city, at least as an international location, both for commercial and residential.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With luxury towers like One57 and the approved 432 Park Avenue, under construction on the site of the former Drake Hotel, there has been a renaissance of residential development in Midtown. ''We need to create other ways of bringing supply, or making potential development sites viable by making them taller,'' Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has fast-tracked the proposed zoning changes and is hoping to get them passed before he leaves office at year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Facing limited options, some developers have turned to converting buildings into higher-end properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A joint venture between the Extell Development Company and the hedge fund <span class="companylink">Angelo, Gordon &amp; Company</span> plans to convert the former Helmsley Carlton House at 680 Madison Avenue into luxury apartments, despite the complications of the building's having a land lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Barnett, the president of Extell, said that Thor Equities, which bought the 35,000 square feet of retail space at the bottom of 680 Madison for $277 million, has ''all the obligations to pay the full ground rent,'' which is on a lease of 150 years. Mr. Barnett said the building would be developed as luxury co-ops with condo rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harry Macklowe is converting two Upper East Side prewar rental buildings he bought in 2011 into luxury condos. He paid $70 million for the 12-story building at 150 East 72nd Street in June 2011, and $253 million for 737 Park Avenue, at 71st Street, two months later, raising eyebrows among some appraisers who thought the prices were high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are very few remaining rental prewar buildings on Park Avenue,'' Richard Wallgren, executive vice president for sales and marketing of Macklowe Properties, said of 737 Park recently while giving me a tour. ''So this opportunity to purchase one of those lone buildings was extremely competitive, and we are delighted to be successful in purchasing it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wallgren declined to say whether the company felt market pressure to create high-end condos. ''We believe we committed to a program that brings out the very best of each building,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Macklowe is combining the former rental units into much larger apartments. At 737 Park, the 100 or so apartments are being converted into about 50 condos. They will range from 3,000 to nearly 6,000 square feet, and will cost an average of $4,000 a square foot. The developer plans to offer a 5,600-square-foot penthouse with a 4,000-square-foot roof deck on the 21st floor for $39.5 million. Formerly two apartments, it will have at least two fireplaces and a somewhat obstructed southwest-facing view of Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since sales started in January, more than 15 percent of the units have gone into contract at 150 East 72nd Street, more than 30 percent at 737 Park, Mr. Wallgren said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Mr. Miller, the move to high-end conversions shows the lengths to which developers will go in the brutally competitive market for development sites. ''It's complicated,'' he said. ''You competed with 30 other people, so you are pressed for what you need to get out of the project. You have to position it as being very upper-end and keep the construction costs in check, to be able to make this a viable conversion.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year property owners sold 158 development sites in Manhattan, up 51 percent from 2011, according to Massey Knakal, a New York property sales company. Of those, owners sold 69 sites in the fourth quarter alone. In dollar terms the volume was $3.12 billion, up 128 percent from 2011,with $1.73 billion sold in the fourth quarter, the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bidding wars behind those sales figures sometimes involved as many as 40 developers battling over a single site, said Bob Knakal, Massey Knakal’s chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ballooning prices are giving developers little choice but to focus on building — or in some cases, converting to — high-end condos. Doing anything less, in most cases, would be too risky, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The fact is, the way the free market is working today, land is just too valuable, so developers can’t afford to do anything but build super luxury product,” Mr. Knakal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be good news for wealthy buyers, many of them foreign, who are demanding the best of the best that New York real estate can offer. But it is not great news for a city starved for affordable housing and more rental units. And it has some real estate experts concerned about how far the legs of the housing resurgence will extend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I worry that if this is all we can develop, how deep is that market?” said Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a property appraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land in New York is worth more today than at the peak of the market in 2007, Mr. Knakal said. While the average price per square foot for a building lost 38 percent of its value from that time, the average price per square foot for land fell only about 18 percent, he said. Why the discrepancy? Not much land was for sale in 2009 and 2010, as sellers decided to ride out the market downturn and hold on to less sought-after sites, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has changed rather drastically in the past year with the surge in the number of development sites being sold. The big sales have not been confined to Manhattan. Last year Mr. Knakal brokered the $54 million sale of a 2.19-acre South Williamsburg site zoned for residential units. The buyer was the government of China, in what Mr. Knakal said he believed was the first such transaction by a foreign-based buyer outside of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, in one of the largest land deals in years, the billionaire Sheldon Solow sold a parcel of land spanning a full block along the East River, between 35th and 36th Streets at First Avenue, to a consortium led by JDS Development group, for $172 million. The land is zoned for residential use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer plans to build two towers, one with 47 stories and the other with 37, for a total of 830 apartments. It is likely they will be mostly rentals, and the conferral of a tax abatement will require 20 percent to be affordable housing units, said Michael Stern, the managing partner of JDS. “This particular deal might be an anomaly because of its size and limited bidder pool,” he added. “It has become almost impossible to do rentals in Manhattan at these land prices.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers’ struggle to build rental units doesn’t bode well for a New York in need of more “work-force housing” for teachers, police officers and fire fighters, Mr. Knakal said. “There are so many millions of people that keep the city functioning,” he said. “If you earn $40,000 a year, where do you live? We need new housing for those folks.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said the tightness in the property market made the proposed rezoning of Midtown East to allow more tall towers “very important to the future of real estate development in the city, at least as an international location, both for commercial and residential.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With luxury towers like One57 and the approved 432 Park Avenue, under construction on the site of the former Drake Hotel, there has been a renaissance of residential development in Midtown. “We need to create other ways of bringing supply, or making potential development sites viable by making them taller,” Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has fast-tracked the proposed zoning changes and is hoping to get them passed before he leaves office at year’s end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Facing limited options, some developers have turned to converting buildings into higher-end properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A joint venture between the Extell Development Company and the hedge fund <span class="companylink">Angelo, Gordon &amp; Company</span> plans to convert the former Helmsley Carlton House at 680 Madison Avenue into luxury apartments, despite the complications of the building’s having a land lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Barnett, the president of Extell, said that Thor Equities, which bought the 35,000 square feet of retail space at the bottom of 680 Madison for $277 million, has “all the obligations to pay the full ground rent,” which is on a lease of 150 years. Mr. Barnett said the building would be developed as luxury co-ops with condo rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harry Macklowe is converting two Upper East Side prewar rental buildings he bought in 2011 into luxury condos. He paid $70 million for the 12-story building at 150 East 72nd Street in June 2011, and $253 million for 737 Park Avenue, at 71st Street, two months later, raising eyebrows among some appraisers who thought the prices were high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are very few remaining rental prewar buildings on Park Avenue,” Richard Wallgren, executive vice president for sales and marketing of Macklowe Properties, said of 737 Park recently while giving me a tour. “So this opportunity to purchase one of those lone buildings was extremely competitive, and we are delighted to be successful in purchasing it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wallgren declined to say whether the company felt market pressure to create high-end condos. “We believe we committed to a program that brings out the very best of each building,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Macklowe is combining the former rental units into much larger apartments. At 737 Park, the 100 or so apartments are being converted into about 50 condos. They will range from 3,000 to nearly 6,000 square feet, and will cost an average of $4,000 a square foot. The developer plans to offer a 5,600-square-foot penthouse with a 4,000-square-foot roof deck on the 21st floor for $39.5 million. Formerly two apartments, it will have at least two fireplaces and a somewhat obstructed southwest-facing view of Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since sales started in January, more than 15 percent of the units have gone into contract at 150 East 72nd Street, more than 30 percent at 737 Park, Mr. Wallgren said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Mr. Miller, the move to high-end conversions shows the lengths to which developers will go in the brutally competitive market for development sites. “It’s complicated,” he said. “You competed with 30 other people, so you are pressed for what you need to get out of the project. You have to position it as being very upper-end and keep the construction costs in check, to be able to make this a viable conversion.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) — A range of economic data on Thursday like claims for unemployment benefits, factory activity and consumer prices pointed to a still-tepid recovery and supported the argument for the Federal Reserve[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/federal_reserve_system/index.html?inline=nyt-org] to maintain its monetary stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed is currently buying $85 billion in bonds a month and has said it would keep up purchases until the labor market outlook improves substantially, although officials are increasingly divided over the wisdom of that course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The economy is in a holding pattern. It’s not going to strengthen sufficiently to justify an end of the current program,” said Millan Mulraine, senior economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 20,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 362,000, unwinding the bulk of the previous week’s decline, the Labor Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second report from the department showed that consumer prices were flat for a second consecutive month in January as gasoline prices fell and the cost of food held steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12 months through January, consumer prices rose 1.6 percent, the smallest gain since July, suggesting there was little inflation pressure to worry the Fed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News on the manufacturing sector, which has supported the economy’s recovery from the 2007-9 recession, was downbeat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Fed</span>’s business activity index dropped to minus 12.5 in February, the lowest level since June. The index, which measures factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region, had fallen to minus 5.8 in January. A reading below zero indicates contraction in the region’s manufacturing sector. The survey covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American economy braked sharply in the fourth quarter, but grew at a 2.2 percent clip for the full year. Output is being hampered by lackluster demand as employment struggles to gain traction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job growth has been far less than the at least 250,000 a month over a sustained period that economists say is needed to significantly reduce the ranks of unemployed. The unemployment rate rose 0.1 percentage point to 7.9 percent in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week’s data on initial jobless claims covered the survey period for the government’s closely watched monthly tally of nonfarm jobs. Jobless claims were up 27,000 between the January and February survey periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the increase probably does not suggest any material change in the pace of job growth given that claims have been very volatile since January because of difficulties smoothing the data for seasonal fluctuations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the weak factory and jobs data, there is reason for optimism about the economy. The housing market recovery is gaining momentum. A report from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> showed existing home sales rose 0.4 percent last month, pushing the supply of homes on the market to a 13-year low. The median home price rose 12.3 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 percent — the largest gain since May 2011 — most of that reflected outsize increases in apparel and education costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“January is a tough month because you get a lot of price hikes at the start of the new year and the seasonals have a hard time sort of adjusting,” said Omair Sharif, an economist at RBS. “I don’t expect the core C.P.I. to maintain that pace of increase in the near-term.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.2 percent in January to 94.1, after an 0.5 percent increase in December.</p>

</div><div class="author">By MATTHEW L. WALD </div><div>836 words</div><div>21 February 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The <span class="companylink">Tennessee Valley Authority</span> will pay Babcock &amp; Wilcox, a nuclear equipment company, to complete extensive design work and apply for permission to build a new kind of nuclear plant, a ''small modular reactor,'' at a site in Oak Ridge, Tenn., the T.V.A. and the company announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two entities did not disclose the value of the contract, which will be paid in part by the Energy Department under a program to encourage nuclear innovation. The announcement is a step forward in a program that advocates hope will develop a new class of nuclear plants that can be mostly built in a factory, shipped by rail or barge, deployed quickly, and sold around the world, especially in places where the power grid could not handle a big plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This technology is very different,'' said Joe Hoagland, a senior vice president of the T.V.A. ''It has built-in safety features and security features, so you can site it at places you wouldn't site a large reactor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the reactors are relatively small, the idea is that in an emergency they can be cooled with the natural circulation of water and heat, rather than by systems that require pumps and valves and that could be disabled by power failures or human errors. The goal for Babcock &amp; Wilcox is a reactor that can be operated by a relatively small control room crew, perhaps two operators, and meet security requirements with fewer guards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christofer M. Mowry, president of Babcock &amp; Wilcox mPower, said that existing big reactors relied on a ''force on force concept,'' with armed guards prepared to repel armed intruders, while the mPower concept was ''force on concrete,'' with a reactor that is under a concrete slab. ''That's a lot easier to defend,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reactor is intended as a direct challenge to natural gas generators, and it is intended to share two characteristics that make gas attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the builders say they can be built quickly and be added onto later, so there is less risk of building too much capacity or running short. Second, they are meant to do something that is difficult for existing nuclear plants but easy for gas: change power output rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grid operators are increasingly challenged by having to integrate large amounts of power from wind farms and solar installations, which can experience surges or drops in output. Planners are looking for supply partners for those variable generators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B&amp;W will prepare an application to build four reactors, and the plan is to build two at the site once planned for the Clinch River Breeder Reactor. Licensing can be completed under existing <span class="companylink">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span> rules, according to Mr. Mowry, who spoke at a Platts Nuclear Energy conference in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said his company wanted to have the first of two units in service at Oak Ridge by 2022, an aggressive schedule that he said was ''eight years and change.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Energy Department could match costs up to 50 percent, depending in part on how much Congress allocates. Mr. Mowry, using a standard electric industry yardstick, said the intended cost was $5,000 per kilowatt of capacity, about $900 million a unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one has built reactors of that size in the United States since the 1960s, but the concept of reviving small reactors has been around in one form or another for 20 years. Four giant reactors intended to be ''passively safe'' are under construction but few seem likely to follow soon. Two years after the Fukushima accident, in an era of low natural gas prices, the small reactor concept is the most popular one in the field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has been lining up suppliers and completing design details. But small is a relative term -- the vessel is 13 feet in diameter and 83 feet high. The idea is for a 180-megawatt reactor, which is about one-sixth the size of new conventional reactors, but about the size of some old coal units now being retired. Reactors would be built in pairs or perhaps larger numbers, adding units as demand grows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Chupka, an economist and consultant at the Brattle Group who specializes in electricity, said, ''one of the impediments to new nuclear is the sheer scale of the financial commitment.'' Building a small reactor is an attempt to sidestep that problem, but ''it's still going to boil down to money and the relative cost of these things,'' which is unknown at present since no one has built one yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A variety of companies have done design work on such reactors. B&amp;W appears to be in the lead at the moment because it has the Energy Department and the T.V.A. in its camp.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home Solar Systems to Be an Option for Honda Customers</span>
</div><div class="author">By DIANE CARDWELL </div><div>747 words</div><div>20 February 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Automakers have long resorted to incentives like zero-percent financing, rewards points and rebates to inspire customer loyalty. Now Honda is offering a different deal: inexpensive home solar power systems for customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through a partnership with <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span>, a residential and commercial installer, Honda and Acura will offer their customers home solar systems at little or no upfront cost, the companies said on Tuesday. The automaker will also offer its dealers preferential terms to lease or buy systems from <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> on a case-by-case basis, executives said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal, in which Honda will provide financing for $65 million worth of installations, will help the automaker promote its environmental aims and earn a modest return, executives said. It could also open the door for more corporate investment in solar leasing companies, which has largely been limited to a small cluster of banks to provide capital for their projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span>, one of the few clean-tech start-ups to find a market for an initial public offering of its stock last year, will potentially gain access to tens of millions of new customers through Honda's vast lists of current and previous owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we partner with financial institutions, they aren't promoting us to their customers, they're essentially just providing us with capital,'' said Lyndon R. Rive, <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span>'s chief executive. But with Honda, he said, the company is gaining, ''access to a broader customer base, and a customer base that is conscious of the environment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the marriage will prove successful remains to be seen. ''I don't think that by finding Honda buyers you've homed in on the perfect solar customer, but there's enough overlapping between the demographics that you're better off than the general population,'' said Shayle Kann, vice president at GTM Research, adding that car buyers were more likely to own their homes and have the income and credit history to qualify for solar leasing. While the American solar industry in general has been struggling in the face of declining government subsidies, overcapacity in production and a glut of inexpensive Chinese panels, interest and investment in solar leasing, or third-party ownership, has continued to grow. According to a recent report from GTM Research, a renewable energy consulting firm that is a unit of Greentech Media, third-party ownership accounts for more than 70 percent of all residential installations in developed markets like Arizona, California and Colorado and has generated at least $3.4 billion in private investment since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> and a rival, Sunrun, were among pioneers of the approach, but players like <span class="companylink">Clean Power Finance</span> and Vivint, a home security company owned by the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, are also gaining momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a typical arrangement, a company provides a system at little or no cost in exchange for a long-term contract in which the customer pays a fixed fee for the electricity generated, set at less than the customer would pay for power from the local utility. The solar price often rises over the life of the agreement, which can last 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Honda approached <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> more than a year ago when it was looking for a partner to provide solar installation services for its hybrid and electric vehicle customers, said Ryan Harty, American Honda's assistant manager for environmental business development. The company then decided to expand to all its customers -- a group it is defining ''very, very broadly,'' Mr. Harty said, to include not just car owners but also those who have explored its Web sites. The offer will be available in 14 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington, and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two companies say they hope the joint venture leads to projects that integrate solar power and electric vehicle recharging for its customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program will give Honda and Acura customers an extra $400 discount on top of <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span>'s normal promotions, which they can use to sweeten the terms of the solar contract, like eliminating the escalation of the monthly payment. Honda projects the fund can finance as many as 3,000 systems on homes and 20 for its dealers. If the program catches on, Honda plans to expand it. Executives said they saw more immediate promise in cutting carbon emissions through solar power than the electric vehicles it would sell.</p>

</div><div class="author">By MICHAEL BARBARO and CHARLES V. BAGLI </div><div>960 words</div><div>14 February 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>22</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A centerpiece of Christine C. Quinn's plan to keep housing affordable in New York City is a variation on a proposed tax subsidy for landlords that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg forcefully rejected two years ago as an unacceptably generous giveaway to the real estate industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aides to Ms. Quinn, the speaker of the City Council and a leading Democratic candidate for mayor, acknowledged that the idea had come from the city's real estate industry, one of Ms. Quinn's closest allies and biggest campaign donors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, the aides said, Ms. Quinn had altered the proposal in important ways since it was heavily criticized by the Bloomberg administration, and predicted that it could, over time, preserve the dwindling supply of apartments that are within reach of the city's middle-class families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She unveiled the plan in her State of the City speech on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure and its origins highlight a recurring tension in Ms. Quinn's rise to political power, between her passion as a former housing activist for liberal causes and her growing willingness to work with the corporate interests that control the levers of power in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her proposal would impose a 30-year cap on real estate taxes for landlords who renew participation in a program that sets aside 20 percent of apartments for below-market rents. With dozens of landlords threatening to withdraw from that program, known as 80-20 or 421a, Ms. Quinn said that a new tax cap would encourage them to keep charging lower rents, rather than convert units into market-rate apartments or condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Good ideas can come from just about anybody,'' Ms. Quinn said in an interview on Wednesday, when asked about the real estate industry's role. Recalling her days as a housing activist, she said it was impractical to formulate a serious affordable housing plan without the industry's participation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you are a housing organizer not willing to talk to landlords and developers, in addition to tenants, what are you getting done?'' she asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City developers and landlords, led by their powerful trade group, the Real Estate Board of New York, have long sought a real estate tax cap, which would guarantee them a discounted and predictable long-term tax bill in return for renting out some apartments at below-market rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current tax rates in prime neighborhoods, the developers say, there is no financial incentive to maintain affordable apartments in their buildings; a tax cap would help alleviate that problem, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics contend a tax cap gives highly profitable developers a sizable tax break on an entire building when a vast majority of apartments inside are rented at prevailing -- and in New York City, generally quite high -- rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whenever the real estate industry is framing the debate around affordable housing, tenants are going to lose,'' said Jaron Benjamin, executive director of the Metropolitan Council on Housing, a tenants' rights group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He expressed dismay over the concept of the tax cap. ''It's almost identical'' to the <span class="companylink">Real Estate Board</span>'s proposal, Mr. Benjamin said. ''We think it's a big mistake to give wealthy developers subsidies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aides to Mr. Bloomberg said they were surprised, even startled, to see the tax cap proposal prominently featured in Ms. Quinn's speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the real estate industry sought a similar set of tax incentives through a bill in the New York State Legislature in 2011, Mr. Bloomberg's office singled out the tax cap for criticism. In a memo, a top aide said the plan was ''not, fundamentally, an affordable housing program,'' but ''a large tax break dressed up as a housing policy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Quinn's aides said that her current proposal, which caps real estate taxes at a substantially higher rate than proposed by the <span class="companylink">Real Estate Board</span> two years ago, would cost the city far less money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The concept and the framework are the same,'' said Preston Niblack, Ms. Quinn's director of finance, ''but the fact that we are talking about a cap that is much higher than the original cap makes this significantly less costly and not a giveaway.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Spinola, president of the <span class="companylink">Real Estate Board</span>, said that while he was pleased Ms. Quinn had raised the issue of a tax cap, he needed greater detail. His members, he said, wanted Ms. Quinn to set the cap at 20 percent of their total rental income per building. That is well below Ms. Quinn's goal of 28 to 31 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Quinn said she wanted developers and landlords to ''break even'' on their investment in affordable housing units in gentrifying neighborhoods, not earn money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of the companies most likely to benefit from a tax cap are major donors to Ms. Quinn. Related Companies, for example, has given her more than $40,000 since 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That has no relationship to what position I take on issues,'' Ms. Quinn said. ''My goal here is not to make any member of the real estate industry, whether they are donors or not, happy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Quinn estimated the cap would cost about $400 million in lost taxes over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her proposal comes at a time when Democratic officeholders have increasingly expressed concern about subsidies to developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been giving away property taxes at an astounding rate,'' said Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat from the Upper East Side. ''The city has a long history of giving away the store to powerful people in real estate. You have to be extremely careful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Quinn said she would vigilantly police the cost. ''Is threading this needle complicated? she asked. ''Absolutely.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major storms like Hurricane Sandy and other unexpected events have prompted some companies to modify the popular just-in-time style of doing business, in which only small amounts of inventory are kept on hand, to fashion what is known as just-in-case management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift has led retailers and logistics companies to alter supply chains by adding distribution hubs, according to the CoStar Group, a real estate research firm in Washington. In turn, the hubs are creating real estate opportunities in markets on and off established distribution paths, including growth in markets outside the traditional seaport hubs on the East and West Coasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just-in-case planning helps retailers keep merchandise on store shelves in the event a supply chain disruption affects one of the major distribution markets. Hurricane Sandy affected the ports of New York and New Jersey, for example, and the 2002 lockout of International Longshore and Warehouse Union workers from West Coast seaports delayed the unloading of container ships for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just-in-case is a response to the vulnerability of just-in-time supply chains, said Rene Circ, CoStar's director of industrial research. Since the 1990s, just-in-time has made sense for many companies looking to reduce the cost of keeping large inventories on hand. Technology enabled retailers and manufacturers to closely track and ship items to replace merchandise sold or components consumed in production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This model also reduced transportation costs, because goods would be shipped only as necessary. By combining the just-in-case with just-in-time strategy, Mr. Circ said, companies are trying to strike a balance between ''carrying the minimum inventory possible, yet never running out of things, because inventory equals cost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Ranger Steel, a company based in Houston that describes itself as the largest privately owned steel plate distributor in the nation, recently expanded its network of distribution centers. Until the late 1990s, Ranger Steel regularly trucked its heavy steel plates directly from a distribution center at the <span class="companylink">Port of Houston</span> to customers throughout the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For a long time that concept worked like a charm,'' said Jochen Seeba, the company's vice president and chief operating officer. ''Then you started to see the spike in fuel pricing, and new governmental rules and regulations on insurance coverage for truck drivers that made truck transportation very expensive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many retailers and wholesale suppliers, Ranger Steel in recent years has added distribution centers to its network, cutting delivery times by moving its inventory closer to customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, suppliers ship steel in bulk to Ranger Steel's seven distribution centers around the country. From there, drivers can deliver orders to most of the company's customers in 24 hours, leveling the playing field with local competitors in markets like St. Louis, where the firm opened a distribution center last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reduced transportation cost is a secondary benefit, Mr. Seeba said. The more significant advantage is the ability to serve and retain customers better in an increasingly competitive marketplace, in which a three-day delivery time to St. Louis from Houston is no longer acceptable. ''You have to adjust your model,'' Mr. Seeba said, ''and that's what we have done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With just-in-time management, smaller on-site inventories put companies at greater risk of running out of merchandise in the event of a disruption. Shaw Lupton, CoStar's senior real estate economist, said companies were trying to mitigate that risk by diversifying supply chains into multiple distribution centers. As evidence, he pointed to a long-term shift of cargo flows from West Coast to East Coast seaports, and a slowdown of the rate at which the largest warehouse markets have captured market share over the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some researchers say that retailers, in particular, are under competitive pressure to establish distribution centers near major population centers. Many states have begun to require online retailers to pay sales tax, making it difficult to compete with brick-and-mortar stores on price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to gain an advantage, online retailers are increasingly offering rapid shipping from nearby distribution centers, Mr. Circ said. ''It's driving this reconfiguration of supply chains and the building of these large warehouses, not just in a few key markets as it used to be, but a lot more widely spread'' across the country, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closer to the customer that a company can transport its goods in bulk, the greater the efficiency and cost savings, said Tim Feemster, senior managing director at the Dallas branch of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, a real estate company. Multiple, well-placed distribution centers minimize the time and distance spent on the final leg of delivery, when trucks are often nearly empty while transporting individual items. ''The final mile is the most expensive cost per pound or cost per piece,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retailers sometimes avoid that final-mile delivery by inviting online shoppers to pick up their purchases from nearby stores, Mr. Feemster said. In those cases, the store functions as a distribution center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tendency toward numerous distribution facilities runs contrary to a strategy that was common just after the recession, when some companies sought efficiency by consolidating warehouse operations, according to Bob Martie, executive vice president for the New Jersey region at <span class="companylink">Colliers International</span>, a real estate service provider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As competition is growing, companies are seeing the need to have better customer service,'' Mr. Martie said. ''Five years ago, one might need two distribution centers to effectively manage the country; now that number seems to be five to seven.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or more, for the largest online retailers. On Jan. 30, for example, <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> announced plans to open three fulfillment centers in Texas, each measuring more than one million square feet. In 2012, the company introduced the development of fulfillment centers in Dupont, Wash., and in Middletown, Del., and made a half-dozen similar announcements the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The redesign of supply chains has introduced some new distribution paths. The <span class="companylink">Hillwood Development Company</span>, based in Fort Worth, will develop two of Amazon's fulfillment centers in Texas, including one at AllianceTexas, Hillwood's 17,000-acre master-planned community north of Fort Worth that is a nexus of rail service, airfreight and highway access. The second will be near Dallas, in Coppell; <span class="companylink">USAA Real Estate Company</span> is developing the third center just northeast of San Antonio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plenty of companies need to establish and maintain distribution centers in smaller markets, too, according to Benjamin Butcher, chief executive of STAG Industrial in Boston. STAG owns and manages more than 29 million square feet of single-tenant industrial properties in 31 states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Butcher said that companies were generally reluctant to make major adjustments to an established supply chain. ''In the tenants we're dealing with, there is a lot of stability,'' he said. ''They don't tend to move unless there is a fairly strong and valid business reason to do it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York is the land of the invisible real estate scheme that one day becomes visible and then utterly bewildering. This week, we turn around and the city comptroller is revealing that 15 years ago, the city agreed to sell the land under the Marriott Marquis in Times Square to the hotel. If the comptroller's numbers are right -- and the mayor's <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> robot moved quickly to mock him in a denial so substantive that it did not use up the entire 140-character allotment for posts -- the city will come away with a dime on the dollar of the actual value of its land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moment of bewilderment: The deputy mayor who did the deal for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said he didn't remember the details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moving on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A classic in the field is Madison Square Garden, which received a tax exemption on its property in 1982, as long as the Knicks and the Rangers agreed to play there for 10 years. Everyone in government apparently thought that meant a 10-year tax abatement. There were great worries that the sports teams would move away, with the trauma of the Dodgers' leaving Brooklyn in 1957 having ossified into an abandonment neurosis, acted out in compulsive, humongous handouts of public money to sports teams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 2002, 20 years from when the ''10-year'' tax exemption was granted, Joyce Purnick, a columnist for The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span>, read the fine print and discovered that it expires on the 12th of Never.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is, Madison Square Garden pays no property tax today either, 31 years later. And by the way, for many seasons, the Knicks gave no sign of playing actual basketball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moment of bewilderment: All the people involved in the deal, which was made when Edward I. Koch was mayor, said they thought the exemption was for only 10 years, but ohmygosh!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the Chrysler Building, that stalagmite of Art Deco glamour dripping upward from the barren plains of Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street. The city has not received property tax on that land since at least 1902, and perhaps before then. The land was owned by the Cooper and Hewitt families, who gave it to the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, encompassing all-scholarships colleges of art, architecture and engineering. Walter P. Chrysler acquired the development rights for the site in 1928, and the building was completed in 1930.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the way, it was agreed that instead of paying property tax to the city, the leaseholders would pay an equivalent amount to the Cooper Union, helping to subsidize the free tuition that was its profoundly democratic founding principle. This year, that came to $18 million, according to Claire McCarthy, a spokeswoman for the Cooper Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's not a great deal of confusion about this real estate deal; a fairly clear public purpose is being met by underwriting the Cooper Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, it is always possible to introduce some.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the city released its tentative tax assessments for the coming year, showing how much revenue the city expected to collect. For the Cooper Union, the city listed the Chrysler Building as one of the places that would be a source of property tax revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Reading those tax rolls is something that people around here consider to be fun,'' said Doug Turetsky, the chief of staff for the city's Independent Budget Office. ''The Chrysler Building was one that jumped right out at them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among others that were, bewilderingly, no longer cataloged as tax exempt: the Museum Tower of <span class="companylink">the Museum of Modern Art</span>, which has a rich deal on a private development; the Interchurch Center, which is part of Riverside Church in Morningside Heights; and the Church of the Heavenly Rest. That church, on the corner of 90th Street and Fifth Avenue, has been tax exempt for more than 80 years, Mr. Turetsky noted in a blog post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Altogether, on just six famous buildings, the city, on paper, projects $70 million in revenue, Mr. Turetsky wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not really, Lauren Passalacqua, a spokeswoman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city budget does not rest on collecting money from properties that should be and actually are exempt, Ms. Passalacqua said. ''Those are tentative tax rolls,'' she said. ''There are adjustments, and the final roll is issued in May.'' Already, she said, the Cooper Union exemption has been restored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was one standout, startling item on the tentative property tax listings for 2014: the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn, with a taxable assessed value of $329.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no worries, sports fans. Like Madison Square Garden, Yankee Stadium and CitiField, this is one more playground where they don't pay property taxes. ''The Barclays Center apportionment,'' Ms. Passalacqua said, ''has been resolved.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the ornate lobby of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, high heels clack across the marble floor, glasses clink at a bar in the corner, neatly dressed porters scurry back and forth, and the buzz of quiet conversation ripples through the room. But just around the corner, at the entrance reserved for residents of the Plaza's condominium apartments, the gilded lobby stands all but silent. Here, very few people come and go, because most of the apartment owners live someplace else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would say 10 percent of the building are really full-time residents like myself, out of about 150 apartments,'' Joanna Cutler, a real estate broker who has lived in the building since 2007, said last week as she sauntered through long, empty hallways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the record,'' she said, after stepping off an elevator shared with a man in a suit and a woman with an enthusiastic bichon frisé, ''I have never seen those people before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pieds-à-terre exist throughout the New York City condo market, a separate little world of vacation homes and investment properties. But the higher the price, the higher the concentration is likely to be of owners who spend only a few months, a few weeks or even just a few days each year in their apartments. This very costly form of desolation means that some of the city's most expensive residential buildings stand mostly dark, lonesome and empty on the inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our next-door neighbors were absolutely lovely, and we saw them maybe once a year,'' said a former resident at 25 Columbus Circle, the south tower of the <span class="companylink">Time Warner Center</span>, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''Most people don't actually live there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no reliable statistics on the number of pieds-à-terre in New York City, but real estate experts say that global economic jitters have drawn more and more astonishingly wealthy people into the market in recent years. They come from all over, whether Monaco, Moscow or Texas, looking for a safe place to put their money, as well as a trophy, and perhaps a second -- or third or fourth or fifth -- home while they're at it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a safe haven,'' said Jonathan Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. ''It's not coming from just one country; it's a global phenomenon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Avram, an assistant vice president at <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> City Living, a company that builds luxury condos, said 40 percent of the buyers at the Touraine, a project at 65th Street and Lexington Avenue, were from foreign countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the ultraluxury condo building One57 on West 57th Street, where two apartments are in contract for at least $90 million, has had billionaire buyers from Britain, Canada, China and Nigeria, as well as from America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the $88 million crash pad at 15 Central Park West, bought last year by a trust linked to Ekaterina Rybolovleva, then 22 years old. Ms. Rybolovleva is the daughter of a Russian billionaire in the fertilizer industry, Dmitry Rybolovlev, who is in the middle of a rather expensive divorce. In a lawsuit filed last year, Mr. Rybolovlev's wife, Elena Rybolovleva, alleged that the apartment was bought not as a place for their daughter to live, but as a way to put that money out of the older Ms. Rybolovleva's reach. According to court documents, the younger Ms. Rybolovleva is a resident of Monaco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building at 15 Central Park West has its share of pieds-à-terre, real estate professionals say. But the concentration there is not as high as in other brutally expensive buildings, especially those in Midtown that share space and services with hotels, like the Plaza or the <span class="companylink">Time Warner Center</span>, which shares a building with the Mandarin Oriental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was living on the 16th floor, and I was pretty much the only one there,'' said Charlie Attias, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> who rented an apartment at the Plaza for three years and has handled many transactions in the building. ''We had the occasional visitor -- I mean, the occasional owner -- once in a while.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Actually, when we saw somebody, it was a big thing,'' he added. ''Oh wow, somebody's in my hallway!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Stewart, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, sold five condos at <span class="companylink">Time Warner Center</span> over about eight years. He has had buyers from London and Hong Kong, Minnesota, New Jersey and Texas -- and not a single one from New York. In all the times he has shown the building to prospective buyers, he added, he never saw more than one person using the condo's gym at a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've seen Kelly Ripa there,'' he said of the television star, who has since moved out. ''Two little kids were playing with Legos on the treadmill next to her, and there was nobody else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elizabeth Lee Sample, a broker at <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> and a member of the board that oversees the <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> complex, estimates that the condos in the south tower are generally about 60 percent occupied, while those in the north tower are only about 30 percent occupied, except during the holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, a spokeswoman for Related Management, which manages the building, said it is staffed for full occupancy at all times, just in case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some residents, like Mr. Attias and Ms. Cutler of the Plaza, say the sparse population means extra privacy, lots of attention from the staff and very little noise. Mr. Stewart said he always pointed it out at <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> as a selling point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, however, describe living in a deserted piggy bank as something else: lonely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I always said when I lived there that it felt very transient, and I wouldn't want to live in that type of building again,'' the former <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> resident said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The building I had come from was like living in a large dysfunctional family,'' the former resident continued. ''Maybe you hated them, maybe there was that aunt you didn't want to talk to at the holidays, but it was still nice knowing everybody.''</p>
<p>Many windows at the Plaza Hotel were dark last week. A real estate broker estimates that only 10 percent of its roughly 150 condominium apartments have full-time residents.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ONE of the best-known residents of Malibu, Calif., alongside billionaires like David Geffen and Larry Ellison, is embarking on a national promotional effort to help sell her home there for the eye-popping price of $25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential buyers may want to try bargaining down the price when they realize the house has only one bedroom and one bathroom — and three walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those clues ought to point to the owner: Barbie, the doll who has, in the imagination of millions of girls, lived on the beach — in a home formally known as the Barbie Malibu Dreamhouse — since the introduction of Malibu Barbie in 1971. Mattel[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/mattel_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org], the toy maker that has marketed Barbie since 1959, is to announce on Thursday that Barbie is posting a “for sale” sign on her house in preparation for a move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement will kick off a campaign that is to culminate with a disclosure of Barbie’s new home, which will be brought to life in a playset that will come out in the fall, in time for the 2013 Christmas shopping season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign is meant to mix actual and imaginary elements. For example, a section of Trulia[http://www.trulia.com/Barbie], the real estate Web site, will carry the for-sale listing for what is being called “the dreamiest of dreamhouses.” Josh Altman, a cast member of “Million Dollar Listing: Los Angeles,” a reality series on the Bravo cable channel, is being “hired” by Barbie to list the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And four designers are forming a dream team, in <span class="companylink">Mattel</span>’s parlance, to advise Barbie in her hunt for a new home. They are Jonathan Adler, who brought the Malibu playset to life[http://laist.com/2009/03/10/photos_of_barbies--yes_the_doll--ne.php] in 2009 as part of a commemoration of Barbie’s 50th anniversary; Lulu de Kwiatkowski; Celerie Kemble; and Trina Turk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the campaign will include some traditional advertising like an ad in Us Weekly magazine, the bulk of it will involve digital media, on platforms like trulia.com[http://trulia.com] and the Barbie Web site, barbie.com[http://barbie.com]; social media like Facebook[http://www.facebook.com/barbie] and Twitter[https://twitter.com/BarbieStyle]; and public relations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign will also include so-called experiential marketing in the form of “Barbie the Dreamhouse Experience” — a touring exhibition, in a partnership between <span class="companylink">Mattel</span> and EMS Entertainment — that is to begin this year in two markets, Berlin and Sunrise, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When <span class="companylink">Mattel</span> reported its fourth-quarter results on Friday, executives said that Barbie sales fell about 4 percent, representing the third quarterly decline during 2012. That trend has set off efforts by <span class="companylink">Mattel</span> to generate interest in Barbie and address challenges like the sluggish economy and the growing interest among children in electronic toys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent examples of <span class="companylink">Mattel</span> initiatives include a campaign, predominantly in social media, to reunite[http://mashable.com/2011/05/05/barbie-ken-social-media] Barbie and her boyfriend, Ken, after a seven-year separation; a Web video series, “Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,” that can be watched on barbie.com/dreamhouse[http://barbie.com/dreamhouse] and YouTube[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKDpnVPK4kI]; and cruises with Barbie themes[http://travel.usatoday.com/cruises/post/2012/09/royal-caribbean-barbie-experience/840991/1] on <span class="companylink">Royal Caribbean International</span> ships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Over all, we’re pleased with the position of Barbie in the marketplace,” said Stephanie Cota, senior vice president for girls’ brands worldwide at the <span class="companylink">Mattel</span> Brands division of <span class="companylink">Mattel</span>. “No. 1 is a good place to be.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, “it’s our job that she remain top of mind,” she added, and “we are at our best when we recognize the cultural relevance of Barbie.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign is being introduced amid signs that the battered American housing market is healing, like an acceleration in groundbreaking for new homes[http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/17/us-usa-economy-housing-idUSBRE90F0YB20130117] and a spate[http://adage.com/article/news/recovery-real-estate-firms-investing-big-events/239553/] of prominent ads by national realty companies that included a commercial for Century 21 during Super Bowl XLVII on Sunday[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/business/media/super-bowl-commercials-relied-on-outdated-ad-tactics.html]. Those may be indications that consumers are ready for a lighthearted campaign about a doll’s foray into the real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbie is “a fun brand, an iconic brand, to partner with,” said Ken Shuman, head of communications at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> in San Francisco. The location of and high asking price for Barbie’s home fit with the focus of a Trulia blog[http://luxe.truliablog.com/] “on luxury celebrity properties,” he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, “we’re a Silicon Valley company, technology-focused,” Mr. Shuman said, “and Silicon Valley has embraced Barbie, voting that computer engineer[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/barbies-next-career-computer-engineer/] be her next career” in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Altman, who works frequently with <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, is also getting into the spirit of the campaign. He said he would be glad to show Barbie new homes “anywhere on the planet” because “she speaks God knows how many languages.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And Ken is fine with whatever she wants to do,” he added, laughing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After suggesting that he might advise Barbie to buy “a skyscraper in Manhattan,” Mr. Altman ended the conversation by declaring: “This is Barbie on the other line; I’ve got to go.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the nontraditional elements of the campaign make it difficult to determine spending. Ms. Cota said it would be comparable to <span class="companylink">Mattel</span>’s spending on Barbie in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, <span class="companylink">Mattel</span> spent $11.6 million to advertise all Barbie products in major media in the first nine months of last year, compared with $8.4 million in the same period of 2011. Full-year spending was $18.4 million in 2011, $17.2 million in 2010, $23.7 million in 2009 and $31.7 million in 2008, Kantar Media reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign is being led by an internal agency at <span class="companylink">Mattel</span>, which is working with Attention, a digital and social media agency, and, for public relations, the HL Group, part of <span class="companylink">MDC Partners</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OVER the last decade, as populations have grown, capital has flowed across borders and crop yields have leveled off, food-importing nations and private investors have been securing land abroad to use for agriculture. Poor governments have embraced these deals, but their people are in danger of losing their patrimony, not to mention their sources of food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Oxfam, land equivalent to eight times the size of Britain was sold or leased worldwide in the last 10 years. In northern Mozambique, a Brazilian-Japanese venture plans to farm more than 54,000 square miles -- an area comparable to Pennsylvania and New Jersey combined -- for food exports. In 2009, a Libyan firm leased 386 square miles of land from Mali without consulting local communities that had long used it. In the Philippines, the government is so enthusiastic to promote agribusiness that it lets foreigners register partnerships with local investors as domestic corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commoditization of global agriculture has aggravated the destabilizing effects of these large-scale land grabs. Investors typically promise to create local jobs and say that better farming technologies will produce higher crop yields and improve food security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, few of these benefits materialize. For example, as The Economist reported, a Swiss company promised local farmers 2,000 new jobs when it acquired a 50-year lease to grow biofuel crops on 154 square miles in Makeni, Sierra Leone; in the first three years, it produced only 50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors, in fact, use their own labor force, not local workers, and few share their technology and expertise. Moreover, about two-thirds of foreign investors in developing countries expect to sell their harvests elsewhere. These exports may not even be for human consumption. In 2008 in Sudan, the United Arab Emirates was growing sorghum, a staple of the Sudanese diet, to feed camels back home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the land being acquired is in conflict-prone countries. One of the largest deals -- the acquisition by investors led by the <span class="companylink">Saudi Binladin Group</span> of some 4,600 square miles in Indonesia -- was put on hold because the area, in Papua, was torn by strife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospects for conflict are heightened by legal uncertainties. Often, an absence of authoritative land registration and titles makes it easy for foreign investors, with the connivance of host governments, to secure land that local communities have long depended upon, even if they cannot demonstrate formal ownership. About 500 million sub-Saharan Africans rely on such communally held land, and land sales can be devastating, as in Mali. Access to food is often cut off, livelihoods are shattered and communities are uprooted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, the land sales provoke protests and then repression. Last year, in Cambodia, where 55 percent of arable land has been acquired by domestic and foreign agribusiness interests, the authorities killed an activist, a journalist and a teenage girl facing eviction; jailed other activists, and harassed politically active Buddhist monks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, financiers have invested in farmland for centuries: Ancient Romans acquired assets in North Africa, just as American fruit companies secured plantations in Central America a century ago. But today's transactions are far bigger. Nearly 200 private equity firms are expected to have almost $30 billion in private capital invested by 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some speculators just sit on high-value land they have acquired without cultivating it. In many traditional communities, this feels like a desecration, a violation of land's purpose and meaning. That kind of capitalist disregard can set the stage for pitched battles over land that investors see as uninhabited, but that local communities cherish as a source of food, water and medicine, or venerate as ancestral burial grounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief drivers of the global farmland race -- population growth, food and energy demand, volatile commodity prices, land and water shortages -- won't slow anytime soon. Neither will extreme weather events and other effects of climate change on natural resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, host countries could limit how much land can be acquired by foreigners, or require that a minimum portion of harvests be sold in local markets. Argentina and Brazil have announced measures to limit or ban new land concessions. But investors use their wealth and their own governments' power to impede regulation. Host governments should establish better land registration practices and enact safeguards against the displacement of their citizens. The <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> and other international entities must ensure that their development projects are free from the taint of exploitative practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, this will be difficult because so many host governments are riddled with corruption and prioritize profit-making land deals over the needs of their populations. Cambodia, Laos and Sudan -- all sites of transnational land purchases -- are among the world's 20 most corrupt nations, according to <span class="companylink">Transparency International</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buy land, they're not making it anymore,'' is a quotation often attributed to Mark Twain. These days, that advice is being heeded all too well.</p>

</div><div class="author">By EUGENE L. MEYER </div><div>1272 words</div><div>30 January 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- For nearly 40 years, the F.B.I. has had its headquarters in a massive example of Brutalist architecture on Pennsylvania Avenue. But the federal government hopes to swap the building and its prime location for a sprawling new home in the suburbs, and there seem to be plenty of developers eager to help make that happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">General Services Administration</span>, the federal government's landlord, held an ''industry day'' this month to lay out its wish list for new F.B.I. headquarters, drawing more than 450 interested developers, architects, brokers and consultants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The property on Pennsylvania Avenue is pretty much irreplaceable real estate,'' said P. Brian Connolly, senior vice president of Akridge, a major Washington real estate development and management firm. ''Real estate is all about location. It's just a great location.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The G.S.A. meeting was the largest for any such offering in memory, administration officials said. Those in attendance included many well-known industry names, among them the engineering firm Greenhorne &amp; O'Mara; the architectural firm <span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</span>; <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>; Booz Allen Hamilton; Siemens Government Technologies; <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>; Tishman Speyer; and <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody is salivating for this,'' said Ron Kendall, a real estate consultant representing a major local developer that did not want to be publicly identified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the monolithic F.B.I. building was completed on Pennsylvania Avenue in 1974, it was, if not a bright light, then at least a glimmer of hope in what was a stagnant downtown in the nation's capital. White flight from the shopping district had followed the 1968 racial riots, and private disinvestment had accelerated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the new building was austere and unwelcoming, with no ground floor windows or retail space, it seemed nonetheless to meet the needs of the agency for space to store files and house its thousands of employees, who it was hoped would inject a modicum of consumer spending into a commercial district that had fallen on hard times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the area around the building, named for the longtime director J. Edgar Hoover, is booming with new life -- new restaurants, upscale shops and high-end residential apartments -- in a stylish neighborhood now known as Penn Quarter. The building itself is deemed obsolete as headquarters for today's <span class="companylink">Federal Bureau of Investigation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The G.S.A. hopes to find a developer willing to take over the 2.4 million-square-foot F.B.I. building, and the now highly valued land on which it sits, and build new, 2.1 million-square-foot headquarters on up to 55 acres in the Washington area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the idea is still in its infancy, it has set off a spirited regional competition to land the prestigious federal agency, with local officials fielding calls from prospective developers and others. Written expressions of interest are due March 24 and the administration expects to issue a formal request for proposals this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.B.I. wants to consolidate its 11,000-employee headquarters staff, now scattered in 20 locations in the area, including the downtown building. For interested parties, it promises to be a high-stakes, long-term investment: any return could be years away, since the new headquarters must be built before the F.B.I. building is swapped. But enthusiasm still runs high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overflow crowd at this month's meeting ''bodes pretty well for this project,'' Daniel M. Tangherlini, acting administrator at the <span class="companylink">General Services Administration</span>, told the group. ''We're looking at the interest of the market in doing this kind of business with us. The amount of interest has continued to grow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.B.I. building, Mr. Tangherlini said, served its purpose. ''It was developed as a giant file cabinet,'' he said, ''a disk drive before disk drives, to make storage and retrieval of paper easier. The F.B.I. is much less about that now; they're stuck with a building representing the technology of a generation or two ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said it would be too costly to renovate or to demolish and rebuild the F.B.I. building at its current site. ''It costs too much to operate and diminishes the quality of downtown,'' he said. ''The neighborhood is completely different now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is more to the project than the F.B.I.'s changing needs. A politically damaging scandal over conference expenses last year forced Mr. Tangherlini's predecessor to resign and brought about a ''top to bottom review'' of the agency's operations, Mr. Tangherlini said, leading it to tighten its belt by looking for new and more economical ways to house government agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, the government wants to dispose of unused or underused properties and, in the case of the F.B.I., take advantage of the property to get a new headquarters building that will cost the government less. The G.S.A. is also seeking to sell an unused heating plant in Georgetown and several underused federal buildings in southwest Washington, but meetings on those projects each turned out only 100 interested parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politics could also play a part in the ultimate decision. Members of Maryland's Congressional delegation, including both senators and Steny H. Hoyer, the House minority whip, have publicly supported a site in Prince George's County, part of which is in Mr. Hoyer's district. A Senate committee resolution said the new headquarters should be within two miles of a Metro station and two and a half miles from the Beltway, but Mr. Tangherlini said the G.S.A. would be flexible in applying those requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the January meeting, David S. Iannucci, an economic development official in Prince George's County, was seen chatting with representatives from the Atlanta office of Walton Development and Management, whose headquarters are in Calgary, Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Iannucci said the firm had recently purchased 2,000 acres in his county, where land is cheaper than in some other jurisdictions. ''We get phone calls practically every day from regional and national developers'' interested in the F.B.I. project, he said. ''All the jurisdictions in the area are focusing on this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven A. Silverman, Mr. Iannucci's counterpart in neighboring Montgomery County, Md., said: ''We are all suggesting possible sites based on what the private sector is telling us. This is the largest real estate deal in the last 10 years, and of course we're interested.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia are also in the game. Jim Herbert, economic development officer for Loudoun County, Va., home to Dulles International Airport, said his jurisdiction, in the suburban outer ring, offered a planned extension of the region's commuter Metrorail system and more undeveloped farmland. ''You get more for the dollar if you don't have to deal with pre-existing structures,'' he said. ''We've got a lot of developers who are very interested.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Connolly, of Akridge, noted that more than land would be involved in meeting the agency's requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anything the F.B.I. does is going to be a highly secured campus, is going to have a very sophisticated communications system, very sophisticated electronic demands and needs,'' he said. ''There will be plenty of redundancy built into the project, because the F.B.I. can never afford to lose power.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By JANE L. LEVERE </div><div>1218 words</div><div>30 January 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span>, the developer of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan, is shifting gears to expand its presence in the city's corporate apartment market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span> bought the <span class="companylink">Beekman Tower Hotel</span> on Tuesday for $82 million with <span class="companylink">Fisher Brothers</span> and Capstone Equities, and plans to convert the traditional transient hotel at 3 Mitchell Place -- near 49th Street and First Avenue -- into furnished, luxury corporate apartments that will require a minimum stay of 30 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company already offers 107 furnished corporate apartments that require a six-month minimum stay at its Silver Towers residential complex, on the south side of 42nd Street between 11th and 12th Avenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a similar vein, <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span> this month began renting 60 furnished, luxury short-term office suites occupying 33,000 square feet on the 46th floor of 7 World Trade Center. It is marketing its corporate apartment and short-term office suite businesses under a new Silver Suites brand. When completed, the Beekman Tower will be renamed Silver Suites Residences at Beekman Tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for luxury corporate apartments in Manhattan is underserved and ready for expansion, according to Martin S. Burger, co-chief executive of <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span>. The existing Silver Suites Residences at Silver Towers have had a 97 percent occupancy rate since the beginning of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those apartments -- studio and one- and two-bedrooms -- range from about 400 to 1,100 square feet, and rent at a 30 to 40 percent premium above market-rate residential apartments in the complex. ''Based on that experience and the occupancy we see, we've concluded there's a real need for this product type in the city,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silver Suites' prime competitors in the sector right now are AKA, which between 2005 and 2007 converted three condominium buildings and one hotel into luxury corporate apartments, and <span class="companylink">Oakwood Worldwide</span>, which rents corporate apartments in 33 residential buildings that are described by STR, a lodging research company, as midscale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extended-stay hotel brands of chains like Hyatt's Hyatt Place, Marriott's Residence Inn and IHG's Staybridge Suites also have a presence in the borough. In addition, the five <span class="companylink">Affinia</span> Hotels in Manhattan of Denihan Hospitality, which originally served only the extended-stay market, now cater to extended-stay and transient guests. (Extended-stay hotels tend to have shorter length-of-stay requirements than corporate apartments, which are usually in residential buildings.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although over 12 percent of demand for hotel rooms in Manhattan is for extended-stay lodging, only 3 percent of the borough's supply of hotel rooms is in this category, said Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said the greatest undersupply in extended-stay housing is for what he called ''upper upscale'' accommodations, which have higher development costs and higher rates than those of Hyatt Place, Residence Inn, Extended Stay America and others. ''Silver Suites is targeted at upper upscale demand,'' Mr. Hanson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to STR, for the first 11 months of 2012, the average occupancy rate for the 12 extended stay hotels in Manhattan was 87.8 percent, up 3.6 percent compared with the same period in 2011, while the average daily rate charged by these hotels was $269.89, up 3.6 percent over the same period in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jan Freitag, senior vice president of STR, called these statistics ''indicators of a very healthy extended-stay industry in Manhattan,'' and said it was ''not surprising that real estate developers are targeting longer-term clientele that does not want to be locked into a long-term, annual lease.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan Meliker, a lodging analyst for <span class="companylink">MLV &amp; Company</span>, a boutique investment bank in New York, said that ''as office employment will continue to grow in Manhattan, so will the demand for corporate travel.'' According to CBRE Analytics, office employment is forecast to grow about 4 percent in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burger said <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span> and its partners will spend $25 million to renovate the Beekman Tower, an Art Deco building that opened in 1929 and was designed by John Mead Howells. The hotel's 174 rooms will be converted into 176 studio, one- and two-bedroom furnished corporate apartments, with an average size of over 600 square feet. All of the apartments will have new kitchens, bathrooms and floors. New mechanical systems, corridors, a lobby and a fitness center also will be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said Silverstein had tried to make the hotel ''work as rental apartments or condominiums, but the numbers didn't make sense.'' Continuing to run it as a hotel also didn't make sense, he added, ''because we would have to spend too much money to renovate the rooms.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burger said he expected guests at the Beekman Tower to include people affiliated with <span class="companylink">the United Nations</span>, pharmaceutical companies like <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> -- whose corporate office is at 235 East 42nd Street -- and nearby hospitals. The property will have a soft opening in September and fully open in early 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartments at the Beekman Tower will require a minimum stay of 30 days, with rates comparable to ''where the competition is, if not a bit under,'' he said. He added that the Beekman Tower's most direct competitor would be the AKA United Nations, followed by Oakwood, which has several East Side buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AKA charges $315 a day for a studio apartment and $425 a day for a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, for stays of 30 days or longer. Oakwood rents range from $160 to $190 a day for a studio, and from $185 to $230 a day for a one-bedroom apartment, all based on a 30-day stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF Consulting USA, said the conversion of the Beekman Tower into corporate apartments made sense. ''Transient hotels have not done particularly well that far east; a lot of transient guests like to be closer to Times Square, where things are going on,'' he said. ''But longer-stay guests are more willing to go a slightly farther distance from where they are transacting business to quieter areas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meliker of MLV said extended-stay brands of hotel chains could be more attractive to long-term guests than Silverstein's apartments because they offer loyalty program points. <span class="companylink">Oakwood Worldwide</span> also offers points in Marriott's loyalty program to guests at its <span class="companylink">ExecuStay</span> corporate housing, which it bought from Marriott last year. Of Oakwood's 33 Manhattan apartment buildings, 21 are operated under the <span class="companylink">ExecuStay</span> brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burger apparently is undaunted by these challenges. He said Silverstein is looking for land for new projects near Lincoln Center and in Hell's Kitchen that would be modeled after Silver Towers and would contain residential and corporate apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silverstein also will operate a new hotel and private residences with <span class="companylink">Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts</span> at 99 Church Street, a project originally scheduled for completion in 2011. Mr. Burger said it is now expected to open by mid-2016.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks were mixed on Monday, lifted by good economic data on the manufacturing industry but held down by a report that the rate of home sales fell short of expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government said before trading began that orders for long-lasting goods rose in December[http://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3/adv/pdf/durgd.pdf] by 4.6 percent, helped by a 10 percent gain in orders for new aircraft. The durable goods report was a sign of strength for the manufacturing sector, a crucial driver of economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A half-hour after trading began, the National Association of Realtors[http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2012/10/pending-home-sales-down-in-december-but-remain-on-uptrend] said its index of pending home sales fell in December, suggesting sales of previously occupied homes could slow. The report was weaker than many economists had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> closed down 14.05 points, or 0.1 percent, at 13,881.93. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index fell 2.78 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,500.18. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite index added 4.59 points, or 0.15 percent, to 3,154.30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heavy equipment maker Caterpillar said separately that its fourth-quarter net income exceeded analysts’ expectations[http://www.caterpillar.com/cda/components/fullArticleNoNav?m=393518&amp;x=7&amp;id=4331240] after adjusting for the cost of a soured deal to buy a Chinese maker of roofing supports for mines. Caterpillar said it took a big charge in the quarter because the Chinese company had misrepresented its finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caterpillar was the biggest gainer in the <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average, closing up $1.87, or 2 percent, at $97.45.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> and the S.&amp; P. 500 are approaching their closing highs, reached on Oct. 9, 2007.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic data may be less likely to support the indexes because traders have become harder to impress as the data strengthened in recent weeks, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist with the PNC Asset Management Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Before, even if you came in just at expectations, that was like a victory,” he said. Because of the market’s recent upturn, he said, “you get less of a pop for just making the numbers.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As home sales pick up in the million-dollar-plus market, deals are being complicated by unexpectedly low appraisal values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With borrowing rates low, even cash-rich buyers are likely to finance part of their purchase, thereby prompting an appraisal by the lender. “Unfortunately,” said Pamela Pagnani, a real estate lawyer in Greenwich, Conn., “the properties are not appraising for what the parties agreed to.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a senior mortgage loan originator for the <span class="companylink">Luxury Mortgage Corporation</span> in Stamford, Peter Grabel sees homes in contract for up to $1.5 million appraising for the purchase price. “But where I get nervous,” he said, “is when we get over $2 million. There are not enough good comps, and appraisals are coming in lower.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is less serious in New York City[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo]. “The higher end of the market has performed better there over the last several years,” said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, “so there’s a larger volume of data.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisers looking for recent sales of comparable homes in the suburbs may face a dearth of transactions in the multimillion-dollar range. The sales they do find may be a drag on current values in a housing market on its way back up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When prices start to move up, for the first two or three months, appraisals will come in low, because the comparable sales were in that lower market,” said Melissa Cohn, the executive vice president of the Manhattan division of <span class="companylink">Guaranteed Rate</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most lenders of “jumbo” mortgages above $625,500 require two appraisals on properties in excess of $2 million, Ms. Cohn said. When the values come in far apart, the lender may ask the appraisers to comment on each other’s results, or simply take the lower of the two values, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any case, a low appraisal is more likely a result of an appraiser’s ignorance about a market than of scarce comparable sales, Mr. Miller said. The appraisal management companies widely used by the big banks may send in an appraiser who lives several hours away. A homeowner may challenge a disappointing appraisal but, Ms. Cohn said, “lenders hardly ever change their mind.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lower appraisal will affect how much a buyer can borrow on the jumbo market. Mr. Grabel used the example of a mortgage with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 70 percent. For a $3 million property, the loan amount would be $2.1 million. If the appraisal came in at $2.7 million, however, the lender would be guided by that lower value and drop the loan maximum to $1.89 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a sharply lower appraisal can derail a deal if it keeps the buyer and seller from reaching agreement on a price. Ms. Pagnani advises buyers in this situation to have a frank talk with the sellers: “You tell them, ‘You’re going to have the same problem with whatever buyer comes along, unless it’s all cash. So let’s negotiate it now.’&nbsp;“</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicole Steel, an agent with Barbara Cleary’s Realty Guild in New Canaan, Conn., agreed. “I have to explain to my sellers that very few buyers in this market are cash buyers,” she said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A funny thing is happening to the United States housing market. It is getting better at an accelerating rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And therein could lie hope for a surprisingly strong economy this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a long time, as the economy worked off the excesses of the boom and cleared out the inventory of homes that should never have been built or were “sold” to people who could not hope to afford the payments. But now the inventory of houses for sale — both new and used — is as low as it has been in decades. Home prices are rising in most markets. Sales have picked up, though they are still low by historical standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We had 48 months of depression in the housing industry,” said Karl E. Case, an emeritus professor of economics at Wellesley College and the co-developer of the Standard &amp; Poor’s/Case-Shiller[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/standard_poors_caseshiller_home_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] house price index. “Housing has brought us out of every recession in the past, and it was not available.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, he said in an interview, “there is no question that we have turned what seemed to be a headwind into a tail wind.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that is correct, the benefits for the economy will be significant. They will not be just in the direct impact of spending on residential construction — although that is now growing at a faster rate than at any time since 1994 — or on such things as carpet and furniture. They will also show up in state and local government spending, until now one of the largest negatives during the slow recovery. Local government revenue is closely tied to property values through property taxes, and the collapse in home values led to layoffs of teachers and policemen, not to mention others, around the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the wealth effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the collapse, the very existence of a wealth effect tied to housing was debated among some economists. In 2001, Professor Case and two colleagues, John M. Quigley of the University of California, Berkeley, and Robert J. Shiller of Yale, analyzed data from 1982 to 1999 and concluded that rising home prices increased consumer spending, but falling prices did not reduce spending significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last four years showed that last part was wrong. This week an updated version[http://www.nber.org/papers/w18667.pdf] of the research, carrying it through last summer, was released by the <span class="companylink">National Bureau of Economic Research</span>. “The extended data now show that declines in house prices stimulate large and significant decreases in household spending,” they reported. (Professor Quigley died before the paper was finished, but he is still credited as a co-author.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They concluded that the decrease in spending caused by a house price decline was greater than the increase in spending produced by an increase in house prices, but that might not turn out to be the case if we have a prolonged gain in prices. There may be a significant amount of pent-up demand for housing — not from people without it but from people who would like to move and would have done so already had the economy been better. Some of those people, perhaps chained to their old homes because the homes are not worth as much as is owed on the mortgages, might view breaking even on the old house as a sign that it is time to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, which reports each month on sales of existing, or used, homes, tries to calculate how many sales are distressed and how much that distress lowers the prices received. Lately, the proportion of distressed sales has been declining slowly and so has the discount. In December, 12 percent of sales were said to be of foreclosed homes, and an equal number were short sales, in which the home is sold for less than the amount owed on the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is reason to hope that those figures will continue to decline. <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> reports that the “shadow inventory” of homes with foreclosures[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] pending and homes already owned by banks but not on the market is declining. It voices hope that banks “are finally putting behind them the operational and regulatory issues that plagued them in the past and are taking the steps necessary to address their backlogged foreclosure inventory.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some point, the declining proportion of distress sales could well mean that house price indexes will begin to rise faster than the underlying market might really justify, as those sales stop holding down the averages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that came as the economy began to strengthen enough that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> decided to let interest rates start to creep up, could that create a rush to buy among those who fear rising prices and mortgage interest rates?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps, but nothing like during the old days. People do know now that prices can fall, demographics will limit the number of new families that need housing, and banks are far less willing to make loans than they were. (That is true even though nearly all mortgages are sold to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Banks fear they will have to repurchase any bad loans they sell, and seem to be erring on the side of caution.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we don’t need a return to boom times for a substantial economic impact. Professor Case points out that during the nearly 50 years from January 1959 through September 2008, there was exactly one month — January 1991 — when the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts, including both apartments and single-family homes, fell below 800,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning in October 2008, there were 47 consecutive months below 800,000. That string ended in September and last month the rate climbed to 954,000. Professor Case thinks it might get to 1.5 million. During the boom, it rose above 2.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year there was a total of 780,000 starts. That was the highest in four years, but it was still lower than would have seemed possible a few years ago. Imagine if that total rises this year to 1.28 million, an increase of 500,000, and that each house involves an investment by the builder of $250,000. That would add an additional $125 billion to the economy compared to 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the most recently reported four quarters — through September, just as housing starts rose above the 800,000 rate — real spending on residential construction rose 13.6 percent. Not since 1994 had that sector risen so rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobs are a lagging indicator — a fact that means home-building employment may be about to rise at a good clip. Notwithstanding the recovery in housing starts, there were fewer residential construction workers, on a seasonally adjusted basis, at the end of last year than there were when total employment bottomed in 2010. But home improvement contractors have started to hire at a good clip as homeowners decide to fix up what they cannot or will not sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this is meant to suggest that the housing market is in good shape. But it is improving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the years running up to the collapse of the housing bubble, Professor Case was among those warning that prices had risen to unsupportable highs. But now he has a different view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I called him this week, he apologized for having to end the interview because of a prior appointment. “I’m going to look at a property that I may buy as an investment,” he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ALISON LEIGH COWAN; Griff Palmer contributed reporting. </div><div>1216 words</div><div>25 January 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Localities across the New York region, already reeling from the cost of cleaning up from Hurricane Sandy, are confronting the prospect of an even bigger blow to their finances: a precipitous decline in property tax revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The storm damaged tens of billions of dollars' worth of real estate, especially in coastal areas of Long Island and New Jersey. As a result, localities can no longer expect to reap the same taxes from properties that have lost much of their value -- in some cases, permanently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without new revenues, state and local officials and Wall Street analysts said, these areas may have to make deep cuts in spending on schools, police and fire departments and other services. They also may be hard-pressed to finance rebuilding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Absolutely, this is going to be devastating for several years,'' said Ester Bivona, former president of the New York State Receivers and Collectors Association, which represents local tax officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Division of Local Government Services in New Jersey estimated this month that more than a dozen municipalities in the state could lose at least 10 percent of their tax bases. About another 10 face a drop between 5 percent and 10 percent, state and local officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the worst hit is Toms River, one of New Jersey's largest municipalities, with 90,000 people. It recently warned Wall Street that property tax receipts could drop 10 percent to 15 percent, according to its financial disclosure documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down the coast, the tiny borough of Tuckerton lost close to 20 percent of its property tax base. In Sea Bright, nearly half the homes are uninhabitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation is similar on Long Island, according to interviews with officials there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The village of Freeport in Nassau County expects that many of its 15,000 homeowners will qualify for reductions in property tax bills, erasing at least 5 percent of property tax revenues and probably far more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts said the looming revenue crisis for localities in the region underscores how natural disasters can have a profound effect long after the debris is gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If localities try to raise overall tax rates to make up for looming deficits, they may touch off a backlash from homeowners with undamaged properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My thing is to encourage property owners to not seek reassessments because you're going to pay on one end or the other,'' said Andrew Hardwick, Freeport's mayor. ''If too many people seek reassessment and are successful with it, that means, how do you pay the bills on the other end? You raise the taxes again? It doesn't make sense.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some localities, like Long Beach, on Long Island, had shaky finances before the storm and are now in deeper trouble, according to local budget records. But many others had been on solid financial ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two major bond-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>, have expressed concerns in recent weeks about the fiscal stability of numerous municipalities in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City and county governments in New York are far less reliant on property taxes than localities, so they are expected to have an easier time weathering a drop in the value of the tax base caused by storm damage. The city, for example, has its own income and business taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, the city and county governments in both states have a much broader property tax base than small localities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $50.7 billion Hurricane Sandy relief bill approved this month by the House of Representatives provides up to $300 million in low-interest loans for localities facing shortfalls. The Senate has supported a similar provision in its own relief package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some local officials said such financing was not nearly enough. States themselves have not yet sent aid, and senior state officials said they were not inclined to do so until federal money was exhausted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a pretty inescapable conclusion that there will be an impact on the tax base,'' said Michael Drewniak, chief spokesman for Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In many instances, we had homes completely wiped out or severely damaged to the point they were rendered uninhabitable,'' Mr. Drewniak said. ''That left behind rebuildable land but, in the meantime, no 'improvements' to tax. In other cases, people may find it cost prohibitive to rebuild at all, depending on their individual circumstances.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could be a year or two before the aftereffects are fully understood, given that localities will have to assess damaged properties before lowering property taxes on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That process, in fact, could be contentious. Some localities take as long as two years to incorporate revised assessments into taxpayers' bills. In the meantime, homeowners may balk at paying the higher tax when their properties are seriously damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But legally, they must pay every penny until the property has been reassessed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corinne DiSomma, the tax receiver for Babylon, N.Y., was duty-bound last month to send out thousands of property tax bills -- her annual ''Christmas cards,'' as friends tease. They were based on July 1 values, no matter that scores of homes, in addition to her own, were heavily damaged in the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Tergesen's home burned down in Babylon when the storm kept firefighters from reaching it in time. Local officials, he said, have since advised him that any reduction of his tax bill could be slow in coming, and ''of course, they want me to rebuild my house as quickly as possible, so I am back on the tax rolls.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Localities are also facing the prospect that homeowners will demand that property taxes be cut because of perceived decreases in the value of land beneath their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assessors rarely mark down land. But some homeowners may argue that their beachfront properties are worth less because buyers, newly sensitive to extreme weather, will avoid areas seen as vulnerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We feel our market value will go down significantly, not just on the house but also the land,'' said Kathy Barisciano, the president of the Ortley Beach Voters and Taxpayers Association, in Toms River. Ms. Barisciano said she has been telling town officials that they must take into consideration the fact that buyers may avoid Ortley Beach because of uncertainty over whether its battered beaches will be replenished and fortified against future storms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some officials said they were trying to find a silver lining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Village of Mastic Beach, a newly incorporated patch of Long Island with 7,500 pieces of property, damage was reported at 400 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Definitely, it's going to hurt the tax base of the village,'' Mayor Bill Biondi said. ''We're a fairly new village, and in the two years, we've been hit with two hurricanes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Biondi said he was hopeful that property tax revenues would rise again once people rebuilt bigger, sturdier homes. He noted that 100 homes in the flood zone were going up on pilings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We may get hit the first year,'' he said, ''and then I'm really hoping to bounce back bigger and better.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think it's expensive to buy a home in New York? Try moving to China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That chart comes from the International Monetary Fund[http://www.imf.org/External/Pubs/FT/GFSR/2012/01/pdf/c2.pdf] (and was brought to my attention by Torsten Slok, the chief international economist at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>). It shows the ratio of house prices to annual household income: that is, how many years' worth of income it would take to buy the typical house in a given city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As you can see, the median house price in New York was equal to 6.2 years' worth of the median pretax household income in 2011. The most comparable data we have for an array of Chinese cities -- shown in red above -- suggests that homes in New York are a steal compared to those in urban parts of the Middle Kingdom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese data (which use a slightly different metric: the price of a 70-square-meter home divided by average annual pretax household income) show that in Shanghai it would cost 15.9 times the typical household income to buy a standard home. In Beijing, the ratio is even higher, at 22.3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate prices are so high in China, Mr. Slok explains, because people have few options for parking their savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The savings rate is phenomenally high[http://english.people.com.cn/90778/8040481.html] in China. The consumer banking sector, however, is not nearly as built out as those in most developed countries, partly because the Chinese government restricts[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/11/business/economy/should-us-services-companies-get-breaks-abroad.html?pagewanted=all] entry of foreign service-providing companies like financial institutions. So people have been investing their savings in a local sector that has had big returns -- real estate -- chasing home prices ever higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I should note, by the way, that housing prices in China began to fall in 2011 as the government tried to curb[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2011-02/16/content_12028324.htm] speculative real estate investment. Home prices then picked up again[http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/18/us-china-property-prices-idUSBRE90H05920130118] in the middle of last year and continue to rise.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) — Sales of existing homes dipped in December from November, in part because of a limited supply of available housing. But the total number of sales in 2012 rose to its highest level in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Tuesday that home sales declined in December to an annual rate of 4.94 million. That rate was down from 4.99 million in November, which was revised lower but was still the highest in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total home sales last year increased to 4.65 million. That is 9.2 percent higher than 2011 and the most since 2007. Sales finished below the roughly 5.5 million that is consistent with a healthy market. Still, most economists say that home sales are improving steadily and that the gains should continue this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stable hiring, record-low mortgage rates and a tight supply of homes available for sale have helped increase sales and prices in most markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">”We remain convinced that the housing recovery is well under way and should continue through 2013,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, an institutional brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is being held back by the shrinking supply of homes for sale. The inventory of available homes on the market dropped to 1.82 million in December, the lowest in 12 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And first-time buyers, who are critical to a housing recovery, made up only 30 percent of sales in December. That is down slightly from a year ago and well below the 40 percent that is typical in a healthy market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the housing bubble collapsed six years ago, banks have tightened credit standards and are requiring larger down payments. Many would-be buyers are unable to qualify for the lowest mortgage rates on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage averaged 3.66 percent in 2012, the lowest annual average in 65 years, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales are rising faster for more expensive homes, the Realtors group said. Sales of homes priced $1 million or more surged 62 percent in 2012, while sales of homes below $100,000 fell 17 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose 7.4 percent on an annual rate in November, the real estate data provider <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> reported. That is the biggest annual increase since 2006, when the housing bubble burst. <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> forecasts that home prices will rise 6 percent nationally this year.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values rose nearly 6 percent in 2012, according to year-end data[http://www.zillow.com/blog/research/2013/01/21/national-home-values-rose-5-9-percent-in-2012-but-high-growth-rate-likely-unsustainable/] from the real estate Web site Zillow. But such increases aren't likely to continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase is the largest annual gain since 2006, near the peak of the housing bubble, and is greater than the typical appreciation seen in healthy markets. Zillow forecasts an increase next year of about 3.3 percent, more in line with typical housing market appreciation. (Historically, annual appreciation averages about 3 percent, according to Zillow's research.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stan Humphries, Zillow's chief economist, said he expected the housing recovery to continue this year, but at a "more sustainable" pace. Tight inventory in some markets, combined with strong demand and a slowing pace of foreclosures, contributed to the rise in values, he said. As values rise, fewer homeowners are underwater, or owe more than their home is worth, and may be more willing to put their homes on the market. The increase in inventory, in turn, should moderate future price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As home values rose in the fourth quarter, foreclosures slowed, to 5.22 of every 10,000 homes nationwide in December. That was the lowest pace since November 2007, when the rate was 5.18 per 10,000 homes, Zillow said. Sales of foreclosed houses stood at 12 percent of the market, down 4 percent from the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery, however, is uneven. Phoenix, for instance, which has had strong investor interest, showed an increase of more than 22 percent year-over-year, a pace reminiscent of the real estate bubble. Cincinnati and Chicago, meanwhile, showed slight declines. Seven of the top 30 metropolitan areas in the study, however, showed an increase in home values of 10 percent or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it's encouraging to see housing values rise rather than fall, there's a risk that consumers may get used to such large increases and expect them to continue, Mr. Humphries said. And that's probably not a good thing. The recent volatility in the housing market makes it easier to think of housing as a shorter-term, speculative investment, he said, rather than as a place to live. "Housing should be thought of as a long-term investment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Has the recent rise in home values changed your perspective on housing as an investment?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDDRIVE through almost any neighborhood around the country, and class divisions are as clear as the gate around one community or the grittiness of another. From the footprint of the house to the gleam on the car in the driveway, it is not hard to guess the economic status of the people who live there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the landscape is carved up by class. From 15,000 feet up, you can stare down at subdivisions and tract houses, and America's class lines will stare right back up at you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan, however, is not like most places. Its 1.6 million residents hide in a forest of tall buildings, and even the city's elite take the subway. Sure, there are obvious brand-name buildings and tony ZIP codes where the price of entry clearly demands a certain amount of wealth, but middle-class neighborhoods do not really exist in Manhattan -- probably the only place in the United States where a $5.5 million condo with a teak closet and mother-of-pearl wall tile shares a block with a public housing project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In TriBeCa, Karen Azeez feels squeezed. A fund-raising consultant, Ms. Azeez has lived in the city for more than 20 years. Her husband, a retired police sergeant, bought their one-bedroom apartment in the low $200,000 range in 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we got here, I didn't feel so out of place, I didn't have this awareness of being middle class,'' she said. But in the last 5 or 10 years an array of high-rises brought ''uberwealthy'' neighbors, she said, the kind of people who discuss winter trips to St. Barts at the dog run, and buy $700 Moncler ski jackets for their children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the local restaurants give Ms. Azeez the sense that she is now living as an economic minority in her own neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>, Mexican and Nobu,'' she said, and nothing in between.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a city like New York, where everything is superlative, who exactly is middle class? What kind of salary are we talking about? Where does a middle-class person live? And could the relentless rise in real estate prices push the middle class to extinction?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people are hanging on by the skin of their teeth,'' said Cheryl King, an acting coach who lives and works in a combined apartment and performance space that she rents out for screenings, video shoots and workshops to help offset her own high rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My niece just bought a home in Atlanta for $85,000,'' she said. ''I almost spend that on rent and utilities in a year. To them, making $250,000 a year is wealthy. To us, it's maybe the upper edge of middle class.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's horrifying,'' she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her horror, of course, is Manhattan's high cost of living, which has for decades shocked transplants from Kansas and elsewhere, and threatened natives with the specter of an economic apocalypse that will empty the city of all but a few hardy plutocrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet the middle class stubbornly hangs on, trading economic pain for the emotional gain of hot restaurants, the High Line and the feeling of being in the center of everything. The price tag for life's basic necessities -- everything from milk to haircuts to Lipitor to electricity, and especially housing -- is more than twice the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's overwhelmingly housing -- that's the big distortion relative to other places,'' said Frank Braconi, the chief economist in the New York City comptroller's office. ''Virtually everything costs more, but not to the degree that housing does.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average Manhattan apartment, at $3,973 a month, costs almost $2,800 more than the average rental nationwide. The average sale price of a home in Manhattan last year was $1.46 million, according to a recent <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> report, while the average sale price for a new home in the United States was just under $230,000. The middle class makes up a smaller proportion of the population in New York than elsewhere in the nation. New Yorkers also live in a notably unequal place. Household incomes in Manhattan are about as evenly distributed as they are in Bolivia or Sierra Leone -- the wealthiest fifth of Manhattanites make 40 times more than the lowest fifth, according to 2010 census data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask people around the country, ''Are you middle class?'' and the answer is likely to be yes. But ask the same question in Manhattan, and people often pause in confusion, unsure exactly what you mean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no single, formal definition of class status in this country. Statisticians and demographers all use slightly different methods to divvy up the great American whole into quintiles and median ranges. Complicating things, most people like to think of themselves as middle class. It feels good, after all, and more egalitarian than proclaiming yourself to be rich or poor. A $70,000 annual income is middle class for a family of four, according to the median response in a recent Pew Research Center survey, and yet people at a wide range of income levels, including those making less than $30,000 and more than $100,000 a year, said they, too, belonged to the middle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You could still go into a bar in Manhattan and virtually everyone will tell you they're middle class,'' said Daniel J. Walkowitz, an urban historian at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>. ''Housing has always been one of the ways the middle class has defined itself, by the ability to own your own home. But in New York, you didn't have to own.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no stigma, he said, to renting a place you can afford only because it is rent-regulated; such a situation is even considered enviable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the clear badge of middle-class membership -- a home mortgage -- it is hard to say where a person fits on the class continuum. So let's consider the definition of ''middle class'' through five different lenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Money You Make</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll start with an obvious marker: If the money you live on is coming from any kind of investment or dividend, you are probably not middle class, according to Mr. Braconi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you live in Manhattan and you are making more than $790,000 a year, then congratulations, you are the 1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most researchers define the middle class by calculating the median income for a place, and grouping people into certain percentages above or below the absolute middle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By one measure, in cities like Houston or Phoenix -- places considered by statisticians to be more typical of average United States incomes than New York -- a solidly middle-class life can be had for wages that fall between $33,000 and $100,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the same formula -- measuring by who sits in the middle of the income spectrum -- Manhattan's middle class exists somewhere between $45,000 and $134,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you are defining middle class by lifestyle, to accommodate the cost of living in Manhattan, that salary would have to fall between $80,000 and $235,000. This means someone making $70,000 a year in other parts of the country would need to make $166,000 in Manhattan to enjoy the same purchasing power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the rule of thumb that buyers should expect to spend two and a half times their annual salary on a home purchase, the properties in Manhattan that could be said to be middle class would run between $200,000 and $588,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the low end, the pickings are slim. The least expensive properties are mostly uptown, in neighborhoods like Yorkville, Washington Heights and Inwood. The most pleasing options in this range, however, are one-bedroom apartments not designed for children or families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not surprising, then, that a family of four with an annual income of $68,700 or less qualifies to apply for the <span class="companylink">New York City Housing Authority</span>'s public housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You Do</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no room for the earlier version of the middle class,'' Mr. Walkowitz said. Firefighter, police officer, teacher and manufacturing worker all used to be professions that could lift a family into its ranks. But those kinds of jobs have long left people unable to keep up with soaring real estate prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A police officer with five years' experience in New York makes about $69,000 a year. A teacher with the same number of years in the city's public school system makes between $50,812 and $63,534.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift toward a knowledge-based and service economy has created a new set of middle-class jobs, like graphic designer, publishing professional and health care administrator. Positions that would nudge a family into the upper class elsewhere -- say, vice president or director of strategy -- and professions like psychologist are solidly middle class in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same holds true for jobs in higher education, a growth sector for the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average tenured university professor at <span class="companylink">New York University</span> or Columbia makes more than $180,000 a year, according to a 2012 survey by The Chronicle of Higher Education. Sweetening the deal for those looking to buy, N.Y.U. has offered mortgage assistance and discounted loans, while qualified Columbia faculty are eligible for a subsidy of up to $40,000 a year. Some faculty members benefit from university housing that rents well below the market rate, in prime locations on the Upper West Side and in Greenwich Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maya Tolstoy, an associate professor at Columbia and a marine geophysicist who studies seafloor earthquakes, lives with her 9-year-old son in a small two-bedroom apartment in a doorman building on Riverside Drive. Because her building is owned by Columbia, her rent, about $1,800 a month, is manageable on an associate professor's salary, which averages about $125,000. A similar market-rate apartment on the Upper West Side costs about $6,000 a month, according to a monthly report compiled by MNS, a brokerage firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's much tougher for people with my income to survive in Manhattan without subsidized housing,'' she said. ''I am very lucky to have it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are Children the Last Straw?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to stay in Manhattan as a member of the middle class is to be in a relationship. Couples can split the cost of a one-bedroom apartment, along with utilities and takeout meals. But adding small roommates, especially the kind that do not contribute to rent, creates perhaps the single greatest obstacle to staying in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 17 percent of Manhattan households have children, according to census data. That is almost half the national average, making little ones the ultimate deal-breaker for otherwise die-hard middle-class Manhattanites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only do children strain the wallet as that one-bedroom becomes infeasible, but many middle-class families have little confidence in public education. Tuition fees at private schools can reach $40,000 a year. So families decamp to the suburbs or hope that their offspring will test well enough to get into the public school system's gifted-and-talented program, which offers a more challenging education free of charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The trauma of kindergarten I still have not forgotten,'' said Ms. Tolstoy, who beyond hitting a jackpot of sorts with subsidized Columbia housing, struck gold again when her son was accepted into a gifted-and-talented program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to get her son that far, she found it necessary to hire a consultant, costing about $800 for two sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Did You Get Here?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 280,000 units -- nearly half of Manhattan's apartment stock -- is rent-regulated in some fashion. These apartments are either godsends to those who occupy them, or daggers that twist in the hearts of everyone else, left to pay market rate or compete for the borough's remaining vacancies -- 2.8 percent of the housing stock, as measured in 2011. But 30 percent of the residents of rent-stabilized apartments moved in more than 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An intriguing definition of what helps a person gain entry to the Manhattan middle class was ventured by Jonathan Bowles, the executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, who issued an in-depth report in 2009 that examined the city's changing class dynamics. ''Understanding who is middle class, in New York, but especially Manhattan, is all about when you got into the real estate market,'' he said. ''If you bought an apartment prior to 2000, or have long been in a rent-stabilized apartment, you could probably be a teacher in Manhattan and be solidly middle class. But if you bought or started renting in a market-rate apartment over the last 5 or 10 years, you could probably be a management consultant and barely have any savings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sabrina Dent was born and raised in Manhattan thinking she was middle class. Ms. Dent grew up attending a private school on the Upper East Side. She did not realize what normal life was until she left Manhattan to attend a public university in Rhode Island, where she paid less in rent than her father had been paying for a 12-by-6-foot parking space in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That radically readjusted my barometer,'' she said. Now Ms. Dent is a Web designer in Cork, Ireland, living a regular middle-class life, and unable to imagine why anyone would want to stick it out in Manhattan on a moderate income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only artists I know now who are still in Manhattan,'' she said, ''either made it big and bought, or are still in the rent-controlled studios they landed in 1976, and will leave in a coffin.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Values That Define You</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People define class as much by association and culture as they do by raw numbers -- a sense, more than anything, of baseline financial security garnished by an occasional luxury like a vacation, and a belief that things can get better through hard work and determination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Middle class, to me, is having a pretty good job, enough money to pay bills and rent, and then a little extra,'' said Desiree Gaitan, 29, a manager of social media for Shairporter, a tech start-up that arranges shared taxi rides to New York airports. She says she feels middle class even though she makes about $40,000 a year (equivalent to about $17,900 a year in a more typical part of the country).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gaitan stays afloat by shopping at thrift stores, picking up baby-sitting gigs when she can, and hanging onto a great deal: she pays $600 a month to share a rent-regulated two-bedroom apartment near Columbus Circle -- a place her roommate's parents found years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's tough,'' she said. ''I have a good work ethic, and I think I would like to stay as long as possible, as long as I'm enjoying my career. All of that is worth it at the end of the day, for some psychotic reason.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are They Dying Out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Manhattan has serious affordability problems,'' said Mr. Braconi, the economist. In the last decade, the percentage of people who are paying ''unaffordable rents'' (defined as more than 30 percent of their income) has increased significantly, according to a report issued in September by the city's comptroller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that trend continues, it will feed the perennial panic that Manhattan's middle class is on the brink of extinction, no longer able to cope with the city's prices and fast retreating to its natural habitat, the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is true that the middle class here is smaller than anywhere else in the country. It is true that price pressures from both real estate and the cost of living are not slowing down anytime soon. But it is also true that calamity has been forecast for over a century now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Soon, there will be no New Yorkers,'' proclaimed the Sunday magazine of The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> in 1907, in an article that detailed how families making $1,000 to $3,000 a year -- $24,000 to $72,000 a year in today's dollars -- were being pushed out because of increasing rents, and servants' wages, as well as the crushing cost of ice and coal. Adjusted for inflation, laundry alone for a family cost $115 a week. A pound of chicken? $8.08. Rent, on the other hand, for a ''small, middle-class flat in a decent, but unfashionable locality,'' would seem to be a bargain in today's market, at the price of $272 per room per month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1968, New York magazine documented the mad scramble for affordable apartments in a cover article detailing the extreme lengths to which average people went to secure one. ''Surgeons have postponed operations, housewives have gone back to work, hippies have cut their hair and families have destroyed their pets,'' the magazine reported. ''Little hope is held out for the middle-income ($15-20,000 a year) people, career girls who do not want roommates and couples with more than one drawer-sized infant.'' Brownstones that had sold for $125,000 in 1958, according to the article, were selling 10 years later for twice that much (in today's dollars, a jump from $827,000 to $1.65 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports of the middle class's demise also appeared in 1978, 1998, 2006 and 2009, when The New York Observer chimed in with ''City to Middle Class: Just Not That Into You.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But members of the middle class remain, scattered among the elite and the growing numbers of the working poor, in that place where lucky deals and tiny kitchens converge, wondering, just as they did in 1910 and 1968, how long they'll be able to stay put.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Azeez in TriBeCa is pondering the question. The only young people she sees moving in around her are often buoyed by parental support, given an apartment at graduation the way she was given a Seiko watch. As her own friends and neighbors age or die out, she wonders, ''who is going to take our place?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: January 27, 2013, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The cover article on Jan. 20, about what level income is considered middle-class in New York, misstated the amount that a public school teacher in the city with five years' experience can earn. It is between $50,812 and $63,534, not between $64,000 and $75,000.</p>

Its 1.6 million residents hide in a forest of tall buildings, and even the city’s elite take the subway. Sure, there are obvious brand-name buildings and tony ZIP codes where the price of entry clearly demands a certain amount of wealth, but middle-class neighborhoods do not really exist in Manhattan — probably the only place in the United States where a $5.5 million condo[http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/450-W-17th-St-APT-2009-New-York-NY-10011/97515600_zpid/] with a teak closet and mother-of-pearl wall tile shares a block with a public housing project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In TriBeCa, Karen Azeez feels squeezed. A fund-raising consultant, Ms. Azeez has lived in the city for more than 20 years. Her husband, a retired police sergeant, bought their one-bedroom apartment in the low $200,000 range in 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When we got here, I didn’t feel so out of place, I didn’t have this awareness of being middle class,” she said. But in the last 5 or 10 years an array of high-rises brought “uberwealthy” neighbors, she said, the kind of people who discuss winter trips to St. Barts at the dog run, and buy $700 Moncler ski jackets for their children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the local restaurants give Ms. Azeez the sense that she is now living as an economic minority in her own neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s <span class="companylink">McDonald’s</span>, Mexican and Nobu,” she said, and nothing in between.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a city like New York, where everything is superlative, who exactly is middle class? What kind of salary are we talking about? Where does a middle-class person live? And could the relentless rise in real estate prices push the middle class to extinction?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of people are hanging on by the skin of their teeth,” said Cheryl King, an acting coach who lives and works in a combined apartment and performance space[http://www.cherylkingproductions.com/] that she rents out for screenings, video shoots and workshops to help offset her own high rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My niece just bought a home in Atlanta for $85,000,” she said. “I almost spend that on rent and utilities in a year. To them, making $250,000 a year is wealthy. To us, it’s maybe the upper edge of middle class.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s horrifying,” she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her horror, of course, is Manhattan’s high cost of living, which has for decades shocked transplants from Kansas and elsewhere, and threatened natives with the specter of an economic apocalypse that will empty the city of all but a few hardy plutocrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet the middle class stubbornly hangs on, trading economic pain for the emotional gain of hot restaurants, the High Line and the feeling of being in the center of everything. The price tag for life’s basic necessities — everything from milk to haircuts to Lipitor[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/lipitor_drug/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] to electricity, and especially housing — is more than twice the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s overwhelmingly housing — that’s the big distortion relative to other places,” said Frank Braconi, the chief economist in the New York City comptroller’s office. “Virtually everything costs more, but not to the degree that housing does.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average Manhattan apartment, at $3,973 a month, costs almost $2,800 more than the average rental nationwide. The average sale price of a home in Manhattan last year was $1.46 million, according to a recent Douglas Elliman report[http://www.elliman.com/reports-and-guides/reports/new-york-city/4q-2012-manhattan-sales/1-388], while the average sale price for a new home in the United States was just under $230,000. The middle class makes up a smaller proportion of the population in New York than elsewhere in the nation. New Yorkers also live in a notably unequal place. Household incomes in Manhattan are about as evenly distributed as they are in Bolivia or Sierra Leone — the wealthiest fifth of Manhattanites make 40 times more than the lowest fifth, according to 2010 census data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask people around the country, “Are you middle class?” and the answer is likely to be yes. But ask the same question in Manhattan, and people often pause in confusion, unsure exactly what you mean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no single, formal definition of class status in this country. Statisticians and demographers all use slightly different methods to divvy up the great American whole into quintiles and median ranges. Complicating things, most people like to think of themselves as middle class. It feels good, after all, and more egalitarian than proclaiming yourself to be rich or poor. A $70,000 annual income is middle class for a family of four, according to the median response in a recent Pew Research Center survey, and yet people at a wide range of income levels, including those making less than $30,000 and more than $100,000 a year, said they, too, belonged to the middle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You could still go into a bar in Manhattan and virtually everyone will tell you they’re middle class,” said Daniel J. Walkowitz, an urban historian at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>. “Housing has always been one of the ways the middle class has defined itself, by the ability to own your own home. But in New York, you didn’t have to own.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no stigma, he said, to renting a place you can afford only because it is rent-regulated; such a situation is even considered enviable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the clear badge of middle-class membership — a home mortgage — it is hard to say where a person fits on the class continuum. So let’s consider the definition of “middle class” through five different lenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Money You Make</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We’ll start with an obvious marker: If the money you live on is coming from any kind of investment or dividend, you are probably not middle class, according to Mr. Braconi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you live in Manhattan and you are making more than $790,000 a year, then congratulations, you are the 1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most researchers define the middle class by calculating the median income for a place, and grouping people into certain percentages above or below the absolute middle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By one measure, in cities like Houston or Phoenix — places considered by statisticians to be more typical of average United States incomes than New York — a solidly middle-class life can be had for wages that fall between $33,000 and $100,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the same formula — measuring by who sits in the middle of the income spectrum — Manhattan’s middle class exists somewhere between $45,000 and $134,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you are defining middle class by lifestyle, to accommodate the cost of living in Manhattan, that salary would have to fall between $80,000 and $235,000. This means someone making $70,000 a year in other parts of the country would need to make $166,000 in Manhattan to enjoy the same purchasing power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the rule of thumb that buyers should expect to spend two and a half times their annual salary on a home purchase, the properties in Manhattan that could be said to be middle class would run between $200,000 and $588,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the low end, the pickings are slim. The least expensive properties are mostly uptown, in neighborhoods like Yorkville, Washington Heights and Inwood. The most pleasing options in this range, however, are one-bedroom apartments not designed for children or families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not surprising, then, that a family of four with an annual income of $68,700 or less qualifies to apply[http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycha/html/assistance/income.shtml] for the <span class="companylink">New York City Housing Authority</span>’s public housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You Do</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s no room for the earlier version of the middle class,” Mr. Walkowitz said. Firefighter, police officer, teacher and manufacturing worker all used to be professions that could lift a family into its ranks. But those kinds of jobs have long left people unable to keep up with soaring real estate prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A police officer with five years’ experience in New York makes about $69,000 a year. A teacher with the same number of years in the city’s public school system makes between $50,812 and $63,534.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift toward a knowledge-based and service economy has created a new set of middle-class jobs, like graphic designer, publishing professional and health care administrator. Positions that would nudge a family into the upper class elsewhere — say, vice president or director of strategy — and professions like psychologist are solidly middle class in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same holds true for jobs in higher education, a growth sector for the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average tenured university professor at <span class="companylink">New York University</span> or Columbia makes more than $180,000 a year, according to a 2012 survey[http://chronicle.com/article/faculty-salaries-table-2012/131433] by The Chronicle of Higher Education. Sweetening the deal for those looking to buy, N.Y.U. has offered mortgage assistance and discounted loans, while qualified Columbia faculty are eligible for a subsidy of up to $40,000 a year. Some faculty members benefit from university housing that rents well below the market rate, in prime locations on the Upper West Side and in Greenwich Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maya Tolstoy, an associate professor at Columbia and a marine geophysicist who studies seafloor earthquakes, lives with her 9-year-old son in a small two-bedroom apartment in a doorman building on Riverside Drive. Because her building is owned by Columbia, her rent, about $1,800 a month, is manageable on an associate professor’s salary, which averages about $125,000. A similar market-rate apartment on the Upper West Side costs about $6,000 a month, according to a monthly report compiled by MNS, a brokerage firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it’s much tougher for people with my income to survive in Manhattan without subsidized housing,” she said. “I am very lucky to have it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are Children the Last Straw?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to stay in Manhattan as a member of the middle class is to be in a relationship. Couples can split the cost of a one-bedroom apartment, along with utilities and takeout meals. But adding small roommates, especially the kind that do not contribute to rent, creates perhaps the single greatest obstacle to staying in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 17 percent of Manhattan households have children, according to census data. That is almost half the national average, making little ones the ultimate deal-breaker for otherwise die-hard middle-class Manhattanites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only do children strain the wallet as that one-bedroom becomes infeasible, but many middle-class families have little confidence in public education. Tuition fees at private schools can reach $40,000 a year. So families decamp to the suburbs or hope that their offspring will test well enough to get into the public school system’s gifted-and-talented program, which offers a more challenging education free of charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The trauma of kindergarten I still have not forgotten,” said Ms. Tolstoy, who beyond hitting a jackpot of sorts with subsidized Columbia housing, struck gold again when her son was accepted into a gifted-and-talented program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to get her son that far, she found it necessary to hire a consultant, costing about $800 for two sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Did You Get Here?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 280,000 units — nearly half of Manhattan’s apartment stock — is rent-regulated in some fashion. These apartments are either godsends to those who occupy them, or daggers that twist in the hearts of everyone else, left to pay market rate or compete for the borough’s remaining vacancies — 2.8 percent of the housing stock, as measured in 2011. But 30 percent of the residents of rent-stabilized apartments moved in more than 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An intriguing definition of what helps a person gain entry to the Manhattan middle class was ventured by Jonathan Bowles, the executive director of the Center for an Urban Future[http://www.nycfuture.org/], who issued an in-depth report in 2009[http://nycfuture.org/content/articles/article_view.cfm?article_id=1233] that examined the city’s changing class dynamics. “Understanding who is middle class, in New York, but especially Manhattan, is all about when you got into the real estate market,” he said. “If you bought an apartment prior to 2000, or have long been in a rent-stabilized apartment, you could probably be a teacher in Manhattan and be solidly middle class. But if you bought or started renting in a market-rate apartment over the last 5 or 10 years, you could probably be a management consultant and barely have any savings.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sabrina Dent was born and raised in Manhattan thinking she was middle class. Ms. Dent grew up attending a private school on the Upper East Side. She did not realize what normal life was until she left Manhattan to attend a public university in Rhode Island, where she paid less in rent than her father had been paying for a 12-by-6-foot parking space in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That radically readjusted my barometer,” she said. Now Ms. Dent is a Web designer in Cork, Ireland, living a regular middle-class life, and unable to imagine why anyone would want to stick it out in Manhattan on a moderate income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The only artists I know now who are still in Manhattan,” she said, “either made it big and bought, or are still in the rent-controlled studios they landed in 1976, and will leave in a coffin.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Values That Define You</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People define class as much by association and culture as they do by raw numbers — a sense, more than anything, of baseline financial security garnished by an occasional luxury like a vacation, and a belief that things can get better through hard work and determination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Middle class, to me, is having a pretty good job, enough money to pay bills and rent, and then a little extra,” said Desiree Gaitan, 29, a manager of social media for Shairporter[http://www.shairporter.com/], a tech start-up that arranges shared taxi rides to New York airports. She says she feels middle class even though she makes about $40,000 a year (equivalent to about $17,900 a year in a more typical part of the country).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gaitan stays afloat by shopping at thrift stores, picking up baby-sitting gigs when she can, and hanging onto a great deal: she pays $600 a month to share a rent-regulated two-bedroom apartment near Columbus Circle — a place her roommate’s parents found years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s tough,” she said. “I have a good work ethic, and I think I would like to stay as long as possible, as long as I’m enjoying my career. All of that is worth it at the end of the day, for some psychotic reason.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are They Dying Out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Manhattan has serious affordability problems,” said Mr. Braconi, the economist. In the last decade, the percentage of people who are paying “unaffordable rents” (defined as more than 30 percent of their income) has increased significantly, according to a report issued in September by the city’s comptroller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that trend continues, it will feed the perennial panic that Manhattan’s middle class is on the brink of extinction, no longer able to cope with the city’s prices and fast retreating to its natural habitat, the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is true that the middle class here is smaller than anywhere else in the country. It is true that price pressures from both real estate and the cost of living are not slowing down anytime soon. But it is also true that calamity has been forecast for over a century now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Soon, there will be no New Yorkers,” proclaimed the Sunday magazine of The New York Times in 1907, in an article[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F00A13F93D5A17738DDDA80894D1405B878CF1D3] that detailed how families making $1,000 to $3,000 a year — $24,000 to $72,000 a year in today’s dollars — were being pushed out because of increasing rents, and servants’ wages, as well as the crushing cost of ice and coal. Adjusted for inflation, laundry alone for a family cost $115 a week. A pound of chicken? $8.08. Rent, on the other hand, for a “small, middle-class flat in a decent, but unfashionable locality,” would seem to be a bargain in today’s market, at the price of $272 per room per month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1968, New York magazine documented the mad scramble for affordable apartments in a cover article[http://books.google.com/books?id=aMcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;ots=0OGfyLMuG6&amp;dq=new%20york%20magazine%20great%20apartment%20grope%201968&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] detailing the extreme lengths to which average people went to secure one. “Surgeons have postponed operations, housewives have gone back to work, hippies have cut their hair and families have destroyed their pets,” the magazine reported. “Little hope is held out for the middle-income ($15-20,000 a year) people, career girls who do not want roommates and couples with more than one drawer-sized infant.” Brownstones that had sold for $125,000 in 1958, according to the article, were selling 10 years later for twice that much (in today’s dollars, a jump from $827,000 to $1.65 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports of the middle class’s demise also appeared in 1978, 1998, 2006 and 2009, when The New York Observer chimed in with “City to Middle Class: Just Not That Into You.”[http://observer.com/2009/02/city-to-middle-class-just-not-that-into-you/]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But members of the middle class remain, scattered among the elite and the growing numbers of the working poor, in that place where lucky deals and tiny kitchens converge, wondering, just as they did in 1910 and 1968, how long they’ll be able to stay put.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Azeez in TriBeCa is pondering the question. The only young people she sees moving in around her are often buoyed by parental support, given an apartment at graduation the way she was given a Seiko watch. As her own friends and neighbors age or die out, she wonders, “who is going to take our place?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: January 27, 2013, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The cover article on Jan. 20, about what level income is considered middle-class in New York, misstated the amount that a public school teacher in the city with five years’ experience can earn. It is between $50,812 and $63,534, not between $64,000 and $75,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARGAIN hunters ought not to overlook properties in need of extensive repairs. A federally backed lending program enables buyers to roll the cost of necessary fixes into their mortgage, which can sometimes yield a quick return on their investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>'s 203(k) program provides for loans that cover purchase and renovation costs for single-family homes and multifamilies with up to four units. The total loan amount is based on the property's appraised value once the repairs are completed. The down-payment requirement is just 3.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using this program, someone who buys a run-down home at a low price, and chooses the renovations wisely, can immediately come out on top, according to 203(k) loan specialists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When people are buying the houses correctly, they're actually generating instant equity,'' said Jeff Onofrio, the director of renovation lending at AnnieMac Home Mortgage in Mount Laurel, N.J. ''It's a matter of getting the right house at the right deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Perillie, a loan specialist at Campbell Mortgage in North Haven, Conn., had a similar reaction. ''The properties that are going to give the instant equity are the bank-owned houses with no heat or a failing roof, and those shortcomings are accounted for in the sales price,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the 203(k) program has been around since 1978, said Paul Welden, the director of the 203(k) Contractor Program in Tempe, Ariz., which trains contractors, ''it was not widely used until this foreclosure mess started almost a decade ago, because there was never a big need for it.'' When that changed, ''it became a necessary tool to be able to sell or buy distressed properties in poor condition.'' Although 203(k) volume is low over all, usage has gone up. About 22,500 loans were endorsed by the housing administration in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2012, compared with about 3,400 in the 2007 fiscal year, government data shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loans are not available to investors -- borrowers must live in the properties. But Mr. Onofrio said he had seen borrowers use a 203(k) loan to buy and renovate a multifamily property, live there a year or so, refinance into a conventional loan, and move on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loans are more expensive than conventional financing, because the interest rates are slightly higher (the average 30-year fixed rate is now around 3.75 to 4 percent) and private mortgage insurance is required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, borrowers must pay a building consultant, who writes the initial estimate of the cost of planned repairs. (Fees range from $400 to $1,000, depending on the extent of repairs.) The consultant also ensures that the repairs will bring the house up to government health and safety standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loans do not cover the addition of a luxury item like a pool. But allowances are made toward the cost of repairing or removing a pool, as well as for the addition of solar panels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renovations must be completed within six months after closing. The contractor is paid in intervals after periodic inspections of how the work is progressing. Borrowers should make sure they hire experienced contractors who understand that they won't be paid upfront and must adhere to strict timelines, Mr. Welden advised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 60 percent of Mr. Onofrio's clients use 203(k) loans to buy bank-owned houses or short sales. Others use them to buy and update older homes, or refinance and redo their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loan limits depend on where the property is. For a single-family property, the limit ranges from $271,050 to $729,750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although 203(k) loans have had a bad reputation among some real estate brokers as too slow to get to closing, delays are often the fault of mortgage representatives who don't really know all that's involved, said Mr. Perillie of Campbell Mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now, the agents are more apt to do them,'' he said, ''a lot of times because it's the only way to get financing on a property that has no plumbing.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits hit a five-year low last week and residential construction surged in December, the latest signs that the American economic recovery remains on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports on Thursday showed the economy was weathering an uncertain fiscal environment surprisingly well. Still, growth in the fourth quarter was most likely subdued, and only a modest pickup was expected in the first three months of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While growth has been slow, the damage done from the uncertainty surrounding the fiscal cliff was not sufficient to topple the recovery,” said Millan Mulraine, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fiscal cliff refers to deep government spending cuts and tax increases, many of which were avoided after a last-minute agreement in Congress. A fight over raising the government’s borrowing limit looms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell[http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/ui/current.htm] 37,000 to a seasonally adjusted 335,000, the lowest level since January 2008, the Labor Department said on Thursday. It was the largest weekly drop since February 2010, ending four straight weeks of increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While problems adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations might have exaggerated the size of the decline, economists said the report still suggested an improvement in the labor market and the economy as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Having taken a pinch of salt, however, we would suggest that the trend in claims generally show no pickup in layoff activity around the turn of the year,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the Commerce Department showed housing starts jumped[http://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] 12.1 percent last month to their highest level since June 2008. Permits for home construction were also the highest in about 4 1/2 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data was confirmation that the housing market was improving, aided in part by favorable weather, with gains in home building across all four regions in the survey. Groundbreaking increased for both single-family homes and multifamily units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing appeared to no longer be a drag on the economy and residential construction was expected to have contributed to growth last year for the first time since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jobs and housing data helped United States stocks surge. The reports came on the heels of data this week showing solid retail sales and manufacturing growth in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the outlook for the economy remains shaky. A report showed that factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region had contracted this month as new orders tumbled, pointing to a cooling in manufacturing activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank</span> said its business activity index[http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/2013/bos0113.pdf] fell to minus 5.8 from minus 4.6 in December. A reading below zero indicates contraction in manufacturing in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Manufacturing has slowed but it’s still growing,” said Gus Faucher, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services</span> in Pittsburgh. “I’m not going to read too much into this until I see other regional surveys.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/lennar_corporation/index.html?inline=nyt-org], the country’s No. 3 home builder, on Tuesday reported a sharp rise[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lennar-reports-fourth-quarter-eps-of-056-186914281.html] in quarterly profit and a seventh straight increase in new-home orders, in further evidence that a housing recovery is on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of the company, however, slipped 0.83 percent on concerns that the growth in orders was slowing and that part of the gain in profit had come from a one-time accounting gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Low mortgage rates, affordable home prices, reduced foreclosures[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and an extremely favorable ‘rent vs. own’ comparison continue to drive the recovery,” the chief executive, Stuart Miller, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, which fell into a deep rut six years ago, has been recovering as low interest rates and rising rents are prompting consumers to buy homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales and prices are rising, encouraging builders to start construction projects. Single-family home prices rose in October, for nine straight months of gains, recent figures show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said that <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> was “extremely well positioned” to gain market share in 2013 and that the company expected to be strongly profitable. The <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> and <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> are the top two American home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, which is based in Miami, delivered 4,443 homes, up 32 percent, in the fourth quarter, while the average selling price of the homes delivered rose 7 percent to $261,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its operating margin on home sales was 12.2 percent, up 6.6 percentage points, helped by an increase in selling prices and a decline in buyer incentives. Orders rose 32 percent, to 3,983 homes, while its backlog at the end of the quarter was worth $1.2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net income rose to $124.3 million, or 56 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, from $30.3 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 42 percent, to $1.3 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of 44 cents a share on revenue of $1.31 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KRISTINA SHEVORY </div><div>1190 words</div><div>16 January 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the strength of Seattle's office market could be chalked up to one company, it would be Amazon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the online retailer was responsible for the city's biggest deal, its largest lease and the purchase of the only large chunk of downtown land to come on the market in decades. Amazon bought its 1.8-million-square-foot headquarters last month from <span class="companylink">Vulcan Real Estate</span> for $1.16 billion, the biggest office sale nationwide and a bold departure for a company that had been content to rent space until last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it's not done yet. Although Amazon leases or owns 2.7 million square feet of space in Seattle, the online retailer plans to more than double that figure when it breaks ground on three office towers of its own on the northern fringe of downtown this year. Amazon did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amazon's flurry of activity has led to rent increases and a drop in office vacancy and has inspired confidence in the market. Other companies, largely led by technology firms, have shaved the vacancy rate to 10.7 percent at the end of last year, from 12.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to Kidder Mathews, a commercial real estate brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest vacancy decrease has been in South Lake Union, an area north of downtown where Amazon's stake in the neighborhood has drawn other companies looking for large floorplates and new buildings. In the last three years, about half of Seattle's net absorption, or the amount of space companies leased and occupied, was in South Lake Union, where the vacancy rate fell to 5.4 percent from 9.3 percent, according to CBRE, a commercial real estate brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing a lot of companies that want to be closer to Amazon and that synergy, whether they do business with Amazon or not,'' said Jesse Ottele, a senior vice president at CBRE in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tighter office market has pushed up rents across the city. The average rent rose to $29.19 a square foot at the end of last year, from $27.80 in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to Kidder Mathews. With few large blocks of Class A office space available and little new space expected to reach the market soon, brokers expect rents to go even higher this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are now talking about building again -- even without a tenant. Eight million square feet of office space are in the works across the city, with more than half planned or under construction in South Lake Union, according to CBRE. Residential developers will also open 5,800 units this year, the most in decades, according to Dupre &amp; Scott Apartment Advisors, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Vulcan Real Estate</span> is betting more companies will want to move to South Lake Union. Although the developer, which owns 30 percent of the land there, has built more than five million square feet of space in the last decade, it has up to seven million square feet of space left that it can build. This year, Vulcan is breaking ground on two office buildings leased to Amazon and a life-sciences research building. If the City Council raises height limits in the neighborhood this spring, Vulcan may move ahead with plans for two more office buildings and three 24-story residential towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're now looking to position ourselves for a recovering economy and teeing up speculative buildings,'' said Ada Healey, a vice president at <span class="companylink">Vulcan Real Estate</span>. ''We want to be in a situation to take advantage of 2013.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other developers are also moving ahead in anticipation of the height rezoning. After purchasing blocks in South Lake Union in the last year and a half, Touchstone and Skanska, a Swedish development and construction company, submitted permits for three office buildings, for a total of 1.1 million square feet, that would exceed current limits. Company executives said they would consider building without a signed tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometime around mid-2012, we saw rents for Class A office that justified new construction,'' said Lisa Picard, executive vice president of Skanska USA Commercial Development in Seattle. ''The project is ready to start. We'll look at the supply and demand of the market and decide whether to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle appears to be at the top of many investors' shopping lists. The Urban Land Institute ranked the city as fourth-best in the country for office buildings thanks to its projected job growth of 1.2 percent and its roster of expanding brand-name companies like <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, Nordstrom and <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>. Real estate investors, who are looking for steady returns, have flocked to Seattle for its stable and growing companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The capital followed the fundamentals,'' said Kevin Shannon, CBRE's vice chairman in Los Angeles. ''Seattle and San Francisco were the two stars in West Coast markets. A couple of years ago, I'm not sure Seattle would be on a core shopping list. We now have a lot of people looking at Seattle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's investment market cemented its revival last year. The volume of deals skyrocketed 203 percent in 2012 over the previous year, to $5 billion, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a research and consulting firm. Among the 14.5 million square feet sold, Amazon's headquarters space is the largest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of the Russell Investments Center building early last year, though, was perhaps the most significant of the year because it showed the city's investment market had fully recovered. When the 42-story office tower was put up for sale in late 2011, it attracted 34 buyer tours, an ''incredible'' number, said Mr. Shannon of CBRE, which handled the sale. It sold last spring for $480 million -- more than four times its purchase price in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After its bid for the Russell building lost, <span class="companylink">Clarion Partners</span>, an investment management company, looked for other buildings with the same ''blue chip roster'' and reliable rents, which it found at 1201 Third Avenue, the city's second-tallest tower and a former headquarters of the failed <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>. Clarion advised on a deal to sell the 55-story tower for $548.8 million, the 10th-largest deal in the country last year, to a joint venture of <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> and an unidentified institutional real estate investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect it to continue to have blue chip tenancy and generate good, predictable cash flow,'' said Steve Latimer, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Clarion Partners</span>. ''We're not expecting spectacular headlines of tripling our money in three years, just steady growth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle's brisk sales pace may slow this year since so many office buildings have traded hands and there are few left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Were there other first-class properties, we'd be interested,'' said Mr. Latimer, Clarion's Seattle director. ''Seattle is clearly a market that will continue to grow.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEFORE anyone can buy a house with a loan[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/loans/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] from a bank or refinance a mortgage[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/loans/mortgages/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], the lender needs an objective assessment of the property’s value — after all, the home is the bank’s collateral for the loan. Assessing the value is the job of the appraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraising a home, particularly in New York City[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo], is not simple. Similar apartments just a few blocks from one another can have very different values. The floor that a home is on, the kind of view or light it gets — each factor contributes to its value. The best appraisers are intimately familiar with the neighborhoods they work in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel, says that with a co-op, he begins by examining the building’s financials: if there is likely to be an increase in maintenance or a special assessment, it might lower the appraisal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartments on higher floors are generally worth more than those on lower floors, particularly when they clear the tops of surrounding buildings, thus affording better views and more privacy, he says. Appraisers record the square footage, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other basics, but they also consider the overall condition, deeming it poor, fair, average or good. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners who put in high-end finishes may be disappointed, because “there is no category for superexcellent,” said Roberta Axelrod, the director of residential sales and rentals for Time Equities. While some buyers may be willing to pay more for those finishes, she said, “there is a difference between what the market will perceive as adding value and what an appraiser will determine.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once an appraiser has evaluated a home, he or she compares it with similar ones that have sold recently, known as comparables, or “comps.” These should be in the same building, or in one nearby in similar financial condition and with similar maintenance fees, Mr. Miller said. But in Manhattan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo], similar apartments a few blocks apart can have different values based on proximity to the subway or a park, or whether the building has a doorman or a gym.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/brooklyn/?inline=nyt-geo], for example, sales within a few-block radius can range from $250,000, for a dilapidated home. to $1 million for a renovated brownstone with original woodwork, said Sam Heskel, the executive vice president of the appraisal management firm HMS Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market trends, also a factor in a home’s value, can be hard to pin down, especially if prices in a specific neighborhood rise quickly. Because it can take two or more months from the time a contract is signed on a home to the time appraisers learn of the offer, such fluctuations are not always reflected in the available comps. Appraisers can make what is called a time-adjustment to account for market shifts, but it may be hard to get a lender to accept it, Mr. Heskel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best thing a homeowner or broker can do to help the appraisal process is to prepare a one-page sheet for the appraiser that outlines the changes and repairs that the home has undergone since it was bought, Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the complexities of New York City real estate, having appraisers familiar with the neighborhoods in which they work is crucial. Unfortunately borrowers don’t always get them. When Shane Koss, a 38-year-old musician, and his wife, Dagmar Kostkova, a 38-year-old farmers’ market coordinator, had their offer accepted on a one-bedroom in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in February 2012, they didn’t anticipate any problems. Then Mr. Koss received a call from the appraiser. He needed directions to Greenpoint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appraisal came in $15,000 under the $400,000 sale price that seller and buyer had agreed on. The loan officer at Quontic Bank suggested that the couple put down $15,000 more, but Mr. Koss and Ms. Kostkova refused. Discussions dragged on as the loan officer tried to get the appraisal amended. George Lazaridis, the president of the mortgage lending division of Quontic, says there is little a bank can do when an appraisal comes in low. Finally, after four months, the couple went to another bank and, with their Quontic loan officer working closely with the new lender to speed the process, closed two weeks later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These cases have become more common in recent years. In response to the housing crisis, Freddie Mac[http://www.freddiemac.com/], the Federal Housing Finance Agency[http://www.fhfa.gov/] and the New York attorney general’s office[http://www.ag.ny.gov/] created the Home Valuation Code of Conduct, which prohibited loan officers from selecting and communicating with&nbsp;appraisers — a provision that has since become a federal regulation. Now most banks use appraisal management companies, which in turn bid jobs out to appraisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisers, brokers and even some lenders say this has only created more problems. David Fuller, the president of the New York State Society of Real Estate Appraisers[http://www.nysar.com/top-navigation/foundations-and-divisions/nyssrea], says that rather than being paid $400 for evaluating an apartment, an appraiser may receive only $250, with the appraisal management company keeping $150. This has driven experienced professionals out of the business. And the management companies, many of them national operations, have bid out jobs to appraisers unfamiliar with the nuances of New York City real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allyson Knudsen, a senior vice president for national underwriting of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, says that it uses seven appraisal management companies, including one called Rels Valuation, in which it owns a minority stake. She says appraisers are generally familiar with the markets in which they work. She adds that Rels’s appraisals come in below purchase price about 9 percent of the time, versus an industrywide average of 12 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet problems seem to persist. Last summer Alexandra Penfold and her husband decided to refinance their New York City apartment. Though the home is a legal two-bedroom, the appraiser recorded it as a one-bedroom. Even though a similar two-bedroom in the building had just sold for $25,000 more than Ms. Penfold and her husband had paid for their apartment in 2008, the appraisal came back shockingly low — $110,000 less than their original purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Penfold notified the bank of the mistake and sent a copy of the offering plan to prove that her apartment had two legal bedrooms. The bank never responded, and she eventually refinanced with another lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After researching Ms. Penfold’s refinance application, Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for the bank, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, said, “We fell short in serving this customer and are refunding her fees.” &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best way to challenge an appraisal is to provide evidence as to why it is wrong, be the evidence an offering plan or relevant comps. But that can be an uphill battle. “You have a better chance of winning Powerball than getting a lender to abandon the first appraisal,” Mr. Miller said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9:00 p.m. | Updated</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> is continuing a large-scale retreat from its costly expansion into the home mortgage market, a shift that concentrates more power in the hands of its biggest rivals and leaves fewer options for some home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank, which already has sharply scaled back in making mortgages, on Monday sold off about 20 percent of its loan servicing business as part of its agreement to pay the housing finance giant <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> more than $11 billion to settle a bitter dispute over bad mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The payment resolves claims that <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> made bad mortgages before the financial crisis that home buyers had a hard time repaying, and then sold those troubled mortgages to the government. When borrowers defaulted - sometimes within months of taking out a mortgage - the taxpayer-supported <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> suffered immense losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less competition in the mortgage market could hurt consumers, potentially raising the costs of borrowing. The problems at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> have cut down its mortgage ambitions; it accounts for 4 percent of the nation's mortgage market, a slide from just over 20 percent in 2009, ceding market dominance to <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> and <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is part of a broader consolidation of banks and that is something that we should all be very, very concerned about," said Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. "Anything that leads to less competition can only be bad for consumers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Monday, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and nine other lenders agreed to an $8.5 billion settlement with banking regulators to resolve claims of foreclosure abuses that included flawed paperwork and bungled loan modifications. While the two agreements were separate, they represented one of the biggest single days for government settlements with United States banks, totaling $20.15 billion, and illustrated the extent of the banks' role in the excesses of the credit boom, from the making of loans to the seizure of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While costly, analysts said, the settlements may reduce legal uncertainties for lenders and spur more banks to compete for home loan business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its agreement with <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, which the government controls, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> will pay the agency about $3.6 billion to compensate for faulty mortgages and $6.75 billion to buy back mortgages that could have resulted in future losses for the government. The bank also agreed to sell to other firms the right to collect payments on $306 billion worth of home loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> is sending a clear message that the bank only wants to be the mortgage lender to a select, small group of people," said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> has been battered by a steady stream of losses after its 2008 purchase of <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span>, the subprime lender that has come to symbolize the reckless lending practices of the real estate bubble. Before Monday, the $4 billion Countrywide acquisition had cost <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> more than $40 billion in losses on real estate, legal costs and settlements. Most of the loans covered in the <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> settlement were issued by Countrywide from 2000 to 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These agreements are a significant step in resolving our remaining legacy mortgage issues, further streamlining and simplifying the company and reducing expenses over time," the bank's chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> said it expected the settlement to depress its fourth-quarter earnings by $2.5 billion. Its shares, which doubled in 2012, on Monday essentially closed flat at just over $12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the settlement will resolve all of the lender's disputes with <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, which weighed on the bank, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> still faces billions of dollars in claims from investors and federal prosecutors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the mortgage market is consolidating in the hands of a small number of banks, the housing market is showing signs of recovery. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> has spent hundreds of billions of dollars to stimulate the economy, driving down interest rates on 30-year mortgages to 3.34 percent. In the last year, this has helped lift house prices from their lows and prompted a boom in refinancings. At the same time, though, even borrowers with strong credit complain about onerous checks and backlogs in the application process. This suggests banks are still struggling to efficiently follow the higher standards introduced since the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly all mortgages that banks make right now are transferred to the government, which guarantees that they will be repaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most analysts agree that mortgage rates would be lower if banks were competing more vigorously for business. Because the settlements could ease legal uncertainties surrounding mortgage lending, a wider array of banks might be encouraged to lend more, eating into the market share of giants like <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every one of these puts a little more distance between the banks and their subprime problems," said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> made 30 percent of all new mortgages in the first nine months of 2012, far ahead of the second-place <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span>, which accounted for 10 percent of the market, according to figures from Inside Mortgage Finance. In 2007, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> originated 11 percent of new mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The markets are actually more competitive than ever," said Vickee Adams, a spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Home Mortgage</span>. She says smaller banks are making gains in some of the nation's biggest urban markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some mortgage analysts said the settlements did not provide the level of legal clarity that the banks crave. "We haven't done enough listening to the banks," said Christopher J. Mayer, a professor at Columbia Business School. For instance, he says, the banks need clearer rules on when they have to take back loans they have sold to government housing entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a big problem may be that many banks are too poorly run to compete, a situation that may not quickly change even with greater legal clarity. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s servicing operations have struggled for several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It may be that <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> decided that it wasn't good enough at servicing," said Thomas Lawler, a former chief economist of Fannie Mae and founder of Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting, a housing analysis firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank is looking to refocus beyond the mortgage business. To that end, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> agreed to offload the servicing rights on two million loans with an outstanding principal of $306 billion. Those rights were scooped up by specialty mortgage servicing firms, including <span class="companylink">Nationstar Mortgage Holdings</span> and the <span class="companylink">Newcastle Investment Corporation</span>, which collect payments from borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman for <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, said, "The strategy is simple: to focus on our core retail customers, to be able to provide an entire array of products and services to them, in which mortgage is an integral product, but not the only product."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between in-laws and layovers, big meals and fat credit card statements, few people want to go shopping for a home during the holidays. So every year, right around New Year's, the New York City real estate market receives a little jolt as listings that stood primping on the sidelines through December burst onto the scene, shoving their best face forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listings Web site StreetEasy, for example, saw a daily average of 56 new listings in December, but 125 new listings on Thursday alone. With so many properties, some fresh and some resurfacing after a holiday hiatus, pouring onto the market at once, it provides the perfect opportunity to highlight a few standouts. Not the apartments, but the advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate brokers have just a few sentences and a couple of pictures to grab the attention of buyers scouring the Internet for their dream home, or at least a nice enough place in which they can fit all their furniture. Some agents use verbal flourishes to distinguish themselves; others are enthusiastic about the caps-lock button. But always, the goal is to do the best with what you have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A listing is like an invitation to a holiday party,'' said Jessica Buchman, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. "You're going to highlight what's going to be wonderful, and maybe skip some details.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Straightforward</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Note: This apartment needs everything and has no views,'' read the listing for a one-bedroom at 39 Gramercy Park North. ''Feel free to bring your architect and window treatment designer along.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brokers, Jesse Shafer and Greg McHale of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, felt that the best way to avoid a parade of buyers walking in and then scooting right back out was to start with the positive, include the negative and appeal to buyers through their pocketbooks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The appliances may have been updated, but they're almost as old as I am at this point,'' Mr. Shafer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the apartment does have its virtues, he added. It is a 700-square-foot one-bedroom in a doorman building that comes with a key to Gramercy Park -- a private, gated garden in the middle of Manhattan. And at $450,000, it is by far one of the least expensive of its profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Peculiar Detail</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing for a $3.95 million co-op pointed out that there was an LCD TV mounted on a bathroom wall; a Sutton Place listing said all the closets were equipped with new doors; and a studio on the Upper West Side celebrated the presence of an original clothes hamper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the winner in this category goes to what appears to be the bud of an emerging little trend: name-dropping the brand of the toilet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several new listings last week made special note of this feature -- a Kohler here, a Toto there -- and a search of real estate listings in The New York Times last week turned up several dozen mentions of that credential. The most expensive listing available last week to point out the brand of toilet was for a West Village town house, with an asking price of $12.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Actually, it has become the Sub-Zero of the toilet world," Leonard Steinberg, managing director of Douglas Elliman, said of the Toto brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Web site for Toto plumbing products, the Neorest 600 model comes with a built-in air-purifying system, a lid that opens and closes automatically, and an adjustable water temperature feature. There is also a manual override function.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Beloved Adjective</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A rare opportunity,'' cooed the listing for an Upper East Side two-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A rare find'' was a two-bedroom on Irving Place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And ''another rare jewel'' was a town house in Greenwich Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of last week, there were nearly 400 real estate listings on The Times's Web site that described some feature of the listing as ''rare.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second Most Beloved Adjective</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Unfortunate Staging</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A naked mattress in a bare bedroom does not exactly scream ''Buy me!'' Neither does the dirty <span class="companylink">Tupperware</span> in the kitchen sink, nor the mysterious tape on the floor. But they were all featured in the listing pictures for a one-bedroom condominium in Rego Park, Queens, which appeared to have been photographed on a cellphone camera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And is that a bottle of Head and Shoulders on the bathtub ledge?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking price: $229,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Tortured Uses of the Word 'Loft'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Exceeds Lofty Expectations,'' proclaimed the write-up of a one-bedroom at the Court Street Lofts in Brooklyn, wearing the pun proudly draped in bold capital letters. That apartment is listed for $525,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another listing employed creativity of a very different sort:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''LOFT-like 1BR!'' it said of an apartment at 106 Suffolk Street, a co-op building that others would describe as a former tenement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Caveat</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many listings come with some sort of condition. ''No pets,'' for example, ''no guarantors'' or ''no pied-à-terres'' are standard fare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last week, a studio on East Ninth Street, right in the heart of <span class="companylink">New York University</span> stamping grounds, barred what is apparently the neighborhood's biggest scourge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sorry,'' the listing said. ''No undergrads.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">11:45 a.m. | Updated</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON - At the start of 2013, European banks are cleaning out their closets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Continent's largest financial institutions, including <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> and <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, are expected to sell a combined 60 billion euros, or $78 billion, of so-called noncore loans this year, a 33 percent rise compared with 2012, according to estimates from the accounting firm <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> released on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renewed effort to offload unwanted assets comes as European banks are eager to reduce costs and shrink their balance sheets to comply with tougher capital requirements demanded by regulators. Europe's persistent financial problems also have altered the industry's economics, leaving many banks with bloated balance sheets and reduced profitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A string of recent scandals, including multibillion-dollar fines for the British bank <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> and its Swiss counterpart <span class="companylink">UBS</span> related to the manipulation of benchmark interest rates, have placed increased pressure of firms to pull back from underperforming and risky business units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of Europe's largest banks also have announced wholesale jobs cuts, particularly in their investment banking divisions, while the number of people working in financial services in London, Europe's financial capital, has fallen to its lowest level since the mid-1990s, according to the British research organization Center for Economics and Business Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fire sale has already included the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span>'s sale of property loans to the private equity firm <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> and its aviation leasing business to the <span class="companylink">Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group</span>, the Japanese bank, for $7.3 billion. <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> also is considering the sale of United States real estate and personal loans worth a combined $6 billion after it already offloaded a number of operations in emerging markets like Pakistan and Colombia to local competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Banks have been doing the right thing by selling off loan portfolios," said Richard Thompson, a partner at <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> in London. "Some of stronger firms also may now be looking to pick up assets on the cheap."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> said that it expected that European banks would focus on corporate and real estate loan disposals, particularly in countries like Spain where prices in the local housing market fell 15 percent annually in the third quarter of last year, according to the latest available government figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The creation in Spain of a so-called bad bank that will oversee the sale of up to 60 billion euros of unwanted assets like delinquent mortgages and unsold real estate on behalf of local banks is also expected to draw interest from potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European banks are keen to sell, but bankers and lawyers say financial institutions continue to demand high prices for assets despite the glut of loan portfolios up for sale. So far, analysts add that differences over price have kept potential buyers, including private equity firms that specialize in distressed assets, from picking up more underperforming loan assets because the firms believe they remain overvalued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the average discount on loans for a range of unwanted European bank assets was 20 percent to 50 percent, according to <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>. That percentage is expected to rise this year, though analysts say the banks' access to cheap short-term financing from the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> has given them some breathing room to demand higher prices for their unwanted assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In 2012, we saw a large number of different banks bringing their portfolios to market," Mr. Thompson said. "The issue of price will clearly remain a key challenge in future for sellers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European banks still have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> estimates that firms still have more than 2.5 trillion euros of noncore loans that they are looking to sell. As the 60 billion euro estimate for loan portfolio sales in 2013 represents just 2.4 percent of that total, Europe's banks are likely to remain eager sellers for many years to come.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CROSBY RAVENSWORTH, ENGLAND -- Surrounded by lush, upland pastures and centuries-old dry stone walls typical of the English county of Cumbria, the small village of Crosby Ravensworth, home to some 300 people, presents an idyllic scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, like much of Britain away from the prosperous districts of central London, the region has been struggling. So the villagers have taken matters into their own hands: saving their pub as a kind of community center and nurturing an affordable housing program that they began a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Butchers Arms, outwardly a typical English pub with a beer garden at the rear, had been at the heart of the village since the early 19th century. It closed in 2010 and then reopened a year later as one of Britain's first community-owned pubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Butchers, as locals usually call it, defied a trend. According to the Campaign for Real Ale, a nonprofit organization that supports pubs and beer drinkers' interests, an average of 18 British pubs close every week, victims of the country's recession and the rising prices of gasoline and public transportation. Since March 2008, it says, 5,500 pubs, or public houses, have shut their doors for the last time, leaving 51,000 in operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In rural communities that have an attractive, well-run public house, there is a tangible bonus for homeowners, said John Longden, chief executive of The Pub Is The Hub, a nonprofit group backed by the brewing and beverage industry, the Post Office and Prince Charles, the group's patron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depending on the region and other factors, Mr. Longden said, ''the difference in house prices between villages with a good pub and those without a pub can be as much as 10 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Jackson, a Birmingham resident who has been searching for a retirement residence in Cumbria, said that ''like many other people, we are looking for a pretty house in a village with a pub, a village store and the chance to walk into glorious countryside from our front door.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Still, it's difficult to know if a nice pub maintains its village or, ultimately, if a nice village maintains its pub,'' said Mr. Jackson, who recently spent a week in the area with his wife, Shirley, to inspect properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith Taylor is the tenant, or operator, of the Butchers, which now has 298 shareholders, each of whom put up £250 to £20,000, or about $400 to $32,500, for shares in the building. Not all are local residents, Mr. Taylor noted, adding, ''A couple from Alaska bought into the pub after taking a walking holiday in the area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expense, including renovations, totaled £300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, along with selling beer and food, the pub has a community room that is used for everything from computer courses for local farmers to meetings of a wrestling club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the property market in Cumbria is faring a little better than in many other parts of Britain. The <span class="companylink">Nationwide Building Society</span> found an average 1 percent drop in the value of homes in the county in the 12 months to October 2011, compared with an average drop of 1.6 percent for Britain as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the properties now listed for sale in Crosby Ravensworth is a three-bedroom stone cottage dating from the 18th century. It has original features like fireplaces and exposed beams -- but with a living room just slightly larger than 18 square meters, or 194 square feet -- and is available through the real estate agency Penrith Farmers' &amp; Kidd's for £335,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crosby Ravensworth is in Cumbria's Eden district, named for the local river. It is the least densely populated district in England and Wales, but its population has risen almost 6 percent during the last 10 years, according to the 2011 census.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To visitors, Eden's traditional stone houses and picturesque villages may make the area seem affluent, but the reality for some families is very different,'' said Mike Tonkin, acting leader of the district council. ''Many households have to run two cars to access employment and basic services. Traditional homes built from materials such as sandstone are difficult to heat and the area's dependence on farming and tourism means Eden also has a relatively low-wage economy, so more affordable housing remains a priority.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, some of the residents of Crosby Ravensworth started their own affordable housing program, starting with a £1,000 grant from the local parish council and public funds earmarked for such a purpose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, 12 new homes have been built, 10 of which house local people with rents set at about a third less than market rates, and two are shared-ownership properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The village's mix of community entrepreneurship and can-do attitude to solving local housing problems was also rewarded by a visit by Prime Minister David Cameron in August 2011. And in October that year, the official opening of the affordable housing project was celebrated with a time capsule buried in the village green. It contained drawings by local children, a mobile phone and a copy of the Butchers Arms' menu.</p>

</div><div class="author">By MICHELLE HIGGINS   </div><div>764 words</div><div>3 January 2013</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Manhattan real estate market went out with a bang in 2012, with the number of sales rising by as much as 40 percent in the last three months of the year — mainly because sellers were in a hurry to close deals before new tax laws kicked in with the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, inventory across the board has continued to fall, leading those in the industry to predict that the scarcity of apartments will bring higher prices in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The consensus is prices are going up,” said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, which reported available listings down 16 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 6,514 — a seven-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corcoran’s report also said sales volume was up 20 percent in the fourth quarter, to 3,200 closings, compared with the same period a year ago, and the median price rose 8 percent, to $827,000. While the rise in prices is good news for sellers, Ms. Liebman said, for buyers, “it’s a very frustrating market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there is little relief in sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Product has dried up, there’s not much available and I don’t see a sudden surge of properties coming onto the market,” said Dottie Herman, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman, which showed in its report that listing inventory fell to 4,749 apartments in the fourth quarter — the lowest level in 12 years. Depending on the location, she estimated prices could rise “anywhere from 5 to 10 percent” in 2013 because of the lack of inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the scarcity of apartments, however, fourth-quarter sales were robust. Rushing to close deals in anticipation of changes to tax laws, wealthy buyers helped push the total number of sales to 2,297 — 40 percent higher than in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to reports by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. The sharp increase in luxury sales bumped the median apartment price up 6 percent to $836,000 compared with the same period a year ago. The number of sales over $10 million rose 44 percent, to 23, from 16 a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All the managing agents in town were just inundated with pressure to close,” said Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens Residential Sales. “Without the tax law changes, a lot of that would have gone on into January or February.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the end-of-the-year frenzy caused sales to pick up, prices have yet to reach pre-recession highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If we’re looking at average or median prices, you’re still about 6 to 7 percent below where you were, over all,” said Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, brokers are optimistic. Corcoran said a wide majority of its Manhattan agents indicated in a recent survey that for the first time since 2009, they felt the market was “strong” as opposed to merely “stable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s now been three years since the recession and each year you see it building with all positive signs,” said Diane M. Ramirez, president of Halstead Property, citing historically low interest rates and pent-up demand. “Customer confidence is coming back. The buyers are motivated. The builders — their confidence is definitely back. I’m very optimistic.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite anticipated price increases in 2013, some analysts say the lift will not signal a real recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a summary of implications for 2013, Sofia Song, vice president of research at StreetEasy and author of the company’s market report said: “In a healthy market, inventory would be low because of high demand. Buyers from all segments, not just the entry-level and luxury, would be clamoring to take advantage of the record-low mortgage rates. But instead, sellers are slow to enter the market and midsegment buyers are feeling trapped.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> said fourth-quarter sales volume was the highest in at least 25 years, but its price indicators were mixed as luxury sales outpaced the overall market and the price of condominiums was relatively stable. Over all, the report showed a 2 percent drop in the median sales price to $837,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Basically the market is flat,” said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and the author of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>’s report. With credit expected to remain tight and inventory expected to remain low, he said, “the market we’re going into is going to be this artificially induced improving market.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of marketing tone, the commercial real estate industry has long played the quiet cousin to the brasher residential business. While apartments are routinely sold using splashy, multifaceted ad campaigns, commercial brokers and developers have favored lower-key, brochure-based approaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the two branches of the family may be growing closer. In recent months, the marketing teams for some New York office buildings have decided to get the word out by deploying the type of stylish Web sites once used only by luxury condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the Web sites of office buildings past, which tended to be bare-bones and buried deep within a landlord's corporate home page, this new crop stands alone and crackles with animation, exuberant language and videos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And by publicizing details like where telecom cables enter the building, these sites add transparency to a business that can seem clubby and secretive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Lunches with brokers is an old-school way of getting your message out,'' said Grant Greenspan, a broker and principal at the <span class="companylink">Kaufman Organization</span>, a landlord that has set up Web sites for two of its buildings, 100-104 Fifth Avenue and 550 Seventh Avenue. But, he added, ''it's only as good as the group of brokers who you perceive to have the clients.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By introducing buildings to the public online to generate demand, Mr. Greenspan said, ''you get clients going to their brokers and saying, 'Why aren't you showing me this building?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site for 100-104 Fifth Avenue, a pair of joined, early-20th-century buildings near Union Square that Kaufman co-owns with Invesco Real Estate, was also useful in chronicling the $15 million renovation that occurred after the development team bought the property out of bankruptcy in 2010 for $94 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renovation, which took two years, included adding a fire safety system and six elevators and redesigning a pair of lobbies. All of this is described in a colorful, animated timeline on the Web site, 100-104fifth.com, as are the specifics about those telecom cables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Kaufman Organization</span> credited the site with helping to fill the 270,000-square-foot building quickly. It is at 98 percent occupancy today, up from 60 percent when the landlord bought it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Greenspan, all six tenants signed there since 2010 said the site had played a major role in piquing their interest. Those tenants include Yelp, the online review business; Apple's iAd, an advertising network; and Net-a-Porter, a women's apparel retailer. They pay rents ranging from $45 to $60 per square foot, Kaufman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, at 550 Seventh Avenue, which Kaufman recently began managing for Adler Group, a new Web site is being used to rebrand the 12-story building in the garment district, where fashion tenants have historically held sway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Web site, 550seventhave.com, may surprise property owners who tend to be tight-lipped about their tenants. It shows the directory in the building's lobby, revealing that Lilly Pulitzer, <span class="companylink">Donna Karan International</span> and Oscar de la Renta have offices inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site, introduced in October, is already paying off. An 11,000-square-foot space on the 10th floor is expected to be leased this month to a software company, Mr. Greenspan said, adding that the $30,000 cost of making both sites, plus the hours logged by a full-time worker, had been worth every penny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Web sites ''facilitate renting the spaces 60 or 90 days sooner, they make all the sense in the world,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some major New York landlords, like the Chetrit Group, have no online presence. And even when Web sites do exist, they can be a bit stolid, offering little more than the year the building was completed, its architect and its total square footage, as with the General Motors Building, owned by <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span>. Brokers say that when a high-rise has existed for years and is one of Manhattan's prized addresses as well, it may not have to promote itself online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new office building must do more, especially when it hasn't even come out of the ground yet. In those cases, a Web site is essential to allow tenants to visualize their future home, said Christopher V. Albanese, president of the <span class="companylink">Albanese Organization</span>, a Long Island-based developer. These sites tend to be extremely eye-catching and could easily be mistaken for ones intended to sell multimillion-dollar condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the <span class="companylink">Albanese Organization</span> unveiled 510w22.com, for 510 West 22nd Street, a planned 170,000-square-foot office building in West Chelsea. The centerpiece of the artful Web site is a four-minute video narrated by the architect Rick Cook, which brims with dramatic music and soaring shots of the adjacent High Line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creating such a Hollywood-caliber product, which includes renderings that normally would not have been commissioned, doubled the building's marketing budget -- ''but without it, tenants might think that this was just some ordinary building, and it really isn't,'' Mr. Albanese said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, financing for the $150 million project cannot be secured until the building is 30 percent leased, he said, making a dynamic marketing tool all the more important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though online videos for commercial real estate are not widespread, they are gaining in popularity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Web site for 7 Bryant Park, a 28-story office building that Hines is developing on Avenue of the Americas, features a two-minute video. A piano tinkles; the camera swoops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site, 7bryantpark.com, introduced last winter, has not led to leases yet, but George C. Lancaster, Hines's senior vice president of communications, said to expect similar branding for future projects. Web sites are ''the first place anybody goes these days to shop for clothes or office space,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Lindvall, a partner at Dbox, which made Hines's video and the Web site for 510 West 22nd Street, agreed. Commercial assignments are coming in more frequently, he said, including one for the International Gem Tower, an Extell Development Company project at 50 West 47th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multimedia Web sites ''have kind of been a residential tactic for a while,'' said Mr. Lindvall, who has worked on apartment projects for Rudin Management and Forest City Ratner. ''I think that relaying square footage and location is not enough to convey what a building represents.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like sites for condos, commercial real estate sites can seem to hawk lifestyles rather than places to put sofas or desks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, businesses are urged to lease space at 837 Washington Street, under construction in the meatpacking district, because of its proximity to the new Whitney Museum and an Apple store -- and, 837washington.com says, ''because when fashion arrived, restaurateurs and hoteliers followed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six-story, 55,000-square-foot, $100 million project is expected to be completed in 2014. Asking rents for the offices are $100 per square foot, said Paul E. Pariser, co-chief executive of <span class="companylink">Taconic Investment Partners</span>, which is developing the building with Thor Equities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Pariser, who sold 111 Eighth Avenue to <span class="companylink">Google</span> in 2010, the tech companies that will most likely rent the space care about the hipness of their neighborhood. ''They don't want some stuffy image that says, 'I have a Madison Avenue address,' '' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Web sites help landlords leapfrog brokers to some degree by taking their message to the masses, the brokers don't seem overly concerned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce Mosler, co-chairman of the brokerage firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield, said he was glad technology had advanced enough to portray large offices compellingly online. He added that condos were ahead of the game only because apartments are simpler to depict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, brokers still need to be at the negotiating table when a lease is signed. ''It will allow the product to get to the market more quickly,'' Mr. Mosler said. ''This town recognizes the value of what brokerages and brokers can provide.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Anyone who knows the history of this town would be surprised to find a fashionable coffee shop on Third Street, with dozens of people walking by. The lattes and chai teas are being sold on a Kendall Square site that had been empty for most of the last 40 years -- since factories with names like American Rubber and the Badger Company were razed for a NASA facility that was never built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the land lay fallow for decades, even as spinoff companies from the adjacent <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> transformed the neighborhood into a major research hub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, this corner of Cambridge is at the center of a real estate boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You sit here and you'd never know there's a recession going on anywhere else in the country,'' Travis McCready, executive director of the Kendall Square Association, said over chai tea recently at Voltage Coffee &amp; Art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cranes are busy on eight separate construction sites in this area, and roughly two million square feet of space is being built or renovated or is under city review here. An additional 1.4 million new square feet is committed, and more is expected elsewhere in this city of 106,000, located directly across the Charles River from the city of Boston. If it all gets built, the new investment in Cambridge will come close to $2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's one of the hottest submarkets in the country,'' said Steven Purpura, managing partner of Richards Barry Joyce &amp; Partners, a commercial real estate firm based in Boston. ''Top two or three for sure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of that growth is connected to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including new buildings for <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> and <span class="companylink">Novartis</span>. Amazon just revealed plans to rent 100,000 square feet here; <span class="companylink">Google</span> is expanding its footprint by 40,000 square feet; and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, I.B.M. and <span class="companylink">Nokia</span> are nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pharmaceutical companies traditionally preferred suburban enclaves where they could protect their intellectual property in more secluded settings and meet their employees' needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in recent years, as the costs of drug development have soared and R.&amp; D. pipelines slowed, pharmaceutical companies have looked elsewhere for innovation. Much of that novelty is now coming from biotechnology firms and major research universities like M.I.T. and Harvard, just two subway stops away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are putting their pride away and working with who they need to work with,'' said George A. Scangos, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Biogen Idec</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scangos's company illustrates the trend. When he took the helm at <span class="companylink">Biogen</span> in 2010, his predecessor had just relocated the company's headquarters to the suburban town of Weston, leaving its scientists behind in Cambridge, a half-hour's drive away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scangos thought the separation was bad for the company, but rather than move the scientists, he decided to bring the company back to town. <span class="companylink">Biogen</span> is now the anchor tenant of a $500 million, 1.7-million-square-foot development being built by <span class="companylink">Alexandria Real Estate Equities</span>, on the former urban renewal site. The rest of its 3,500 local employees will occupy a second building nearby also expected to be completed by late 2013 by <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an amazing place to be,'' Mr. Scangos said. ''The intellectual firepower that is in Cambridge, between Harvard and M.I.T. and the number of companies, is quite remarkable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> also chose Cambridge when it was looking to consolidate some of its research operations. In 2011, the pharmaceutical giant announced it would move 400 research jobs to a new building on M.I.T.-owned land in Cambridge, even as it was closing facilities in Groton, Conn., and elsewhere. That $300 million, 180,000-square-foot building is expected to be completed later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Novartis</span>, one of the first giant pharmaceutical companies to set up major operations in Cambridge, is adding two buildings to its campus on Massachusetts Avenue. They will occupy a combined 550,000 square feet at a cost of $600 million when they open in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a fourth pharmaceutical company, <span class="companylink">Millennium: The Takeda Oncology Company</span>, hopes to double its Cambridge footprint, occupying a 250,000-square-foot building proposed in Central Square, just down Massachusetts Avenue from M.I.T.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trends in philanthropy are helping Cambridge, as well. Large donations from private philanthropies helped build the $200 million David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, completed last year on the M.I.T. campus, in addition to a second, 250,000-square-foot building for the <span class="companylink">Broad Institute</span>, a genetics research institute spun off from Harvard and M.I.T. The Ragon Institute, a collaborative venture of M.I.T., Harvard and <span class="companylink">Massachusetts General Hospital</span> to support AIDS vaccine research, will move into a nearby building now being renovated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another boost is coming from area hospitals. Five Harvard-affiliated hospitals and <span class="companylink">Harvard Medical School</span> are clustered in Boston's Longwood Medical Area. While that area is nearly built out, Kendall Square is one stop on the rail line from Mass General, the other Harvard-affiliated flagship hospital, providing easy collaboration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scangos said he liked to look out his office window and see all his competitors. When he goes downstairs to lunch, he has choices now, beyond the food trucks and cafeterias that were the only options a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the closest drugstore and market are still a 20-minute walk away, that may change soon, too. Over the last seven years, 1,000 housing units have opened up in Kendall Square, adding to demand for such stores, Mr. McCready said. And last month, M.I.T. formally filed a rezoning petition with the city to turn 26 acres near its red line subway stop into a ''gateway'' for the campus, along with nearly 1 million square feet of office space and 240,000 square feet for housing units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All in all, it's a pretty exciting time,'' said Robert Healy, Cambridge's city manager for more than three decades. ''This is not the best of economic times. Yet there's still the faith being shown in Cambridge by virtue of what's in the ground and going up now.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news: Building permits for new developments are back on the rise, which means much-needed apartments should soon follow. The bad news: It still won’t be enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the year through October, the city issued permits for 40 new residential buildings in Manhattan, for a total of 2,287 new units, according to the latest census numbers. That’s up 15 percent compared with the same period in 2011, but still far from normal. In Brooklyn the numbers are a bit higher. Permits were filed for 2,756 units through the first 10 months of the year, as opposed to 1,522 for all of last year. Even so, the numbers haven’t kept pace with demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have a dire need for new product and it’s not coming fast enough,” said Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens. Although the drop in permits started to reverse itself last year, and the increase this year is noteworthy, Mr. Heym said, “it’s not going to be a recovery until we get back to the long-term average, which is closer to 4,000 or 5,000 new units a year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan permits peaked in 2008 at 9,700 units before <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed and construction loans began drying up. The lack of financing brought construction to a halt, and so-called shadow inventory — projects that were started before the credit valve was turned off — was completed and sold or turned into rentals. Rising demand and a scarcity of new apartments have created something of a rush on new luxury condominiums in choice New York neighborhoods, with some buyers signing contracts for spaces even before they are built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the trend could become more pronounced. “With such a low level of inventory,” Mr. Heym said, “you’re going to see prices start to rise more rapidly at some point, because there just won’t be enough apartments to go around.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are beginning to find ways to finance future projects, but major challenges remain. Land costs are still high, and more upfront equity is required than before, Mr. Heym said. Permits don’t always immediately translate to new units, either. The lag time between the filing of a permit and the selling of an apartment is typically six months to two years. There is also the question of how many of the units will be designated as rentals and how many for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just 58 residential buildings are expected to open next year in Manhattan, not counting any in Harlem and Upper Manhattan, with a total of 2,474 new units, according to projections by the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which tracks new development. That’s the highest number since 2007. That year, 8,052 new units came on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It just goes to show you that all the naysayers were very, very wrong,” said Mr. Heym, pointing out that at the beginning of the downturn, some skeptics expected stalled projects to come back at some point and flood the market. “That hasn’t happened,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the scarcity of apartments now, he added, one might almost wish it would.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">To Givers of Down Payments</span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME buyers trying to scrape together enough money to cover the typical 20 percent down payment frequently look to relatives for help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> survey of people who bought homes from July 2011 to June 2012, about a quarter of first-time buyers relied in part on gifts from relatives. ''Typically, that's the Bank of Mom and Dad,'' said Walter Molony, a spokesman for the association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mortgage lenders closely scrutinize cash gifts. That critical check from the parents may not count toward your home purchase if you can't thoroughly document its source and intention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Basically, the banks want to make sure that you're not getting a second loan,'' said Ray Mignone of the New York financial planning firm Ray Mignone &amp; Associates. ''If all of a sudden $50,000 pops into your account, they want to make sure it's not a loan against the property that they're going to put a mortgage on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How to pass muster with the lender? First, it's best if the gift comes from a close relative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It can't be a friend or colleague, '' said Ace Watanasuparp, the president of DE Capital Mortgage, in New York. ''And it can't be your second cousin or something like that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next, make sure that the gift comes in the form of a check or wire transfer -- something traceable. Lenders are typically wary of gifts made in cash, Mr. Watanasuparp said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The donor will also have to provide the lender with what is known as a gift letter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melissa L. Cohn, the chief executive of Manhattan Mortgage, said the gift letter should affirm that the money involved is indeed a gift from the donor and, more important, that repayment is not required. The donor should also specify the precise amount of the gift, and state his or her relationship to the borrower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For good measure, Ms. Cohn added, donors should provide proof of their ability to give the gift -- for instance, evidence of a stock sale, or a statement showing the withdrawal. Once the money is in the borrower's account, the lender may also want to see proof of a deposit in the exact amount stated in the gift letter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how heavily a borrower may rely on family largess to cover a down payment depends on the type of mortgage involved and the size of the gift. With a conventional loan, lenders require that borrowers contribute at least 5 percent of their own money. But this minimum does not apply if the borrower is getting a gift that amounts to 20 percent or more of the home purchase price, Ms. Cohn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers using a loan from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> may use gifts to cover their entire down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mignone advises prospective buyers to deposit any monetary gifts into their account a few months before seeking a mortgage. That way, he said, the bank is less likely to question them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for would-be donors, before writing a check, they should consider their liability under federal gift tax regulations. Individual gifts of $13,000 or less are exempt from the tax. This may sound like a low ceiling, but the gift allowed for is larger than it appears. For example, if two parents want to give money to their newlywed daughter, each may give $13,000 to the daughter, and $13,000 to her partner, for a nontaxable total of $52,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donors can spread more cheer into the next year -- and double the amount to the same couple, to $104,000 -- by timing the gifts for December and January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Write each check separately,'' Mr. Mignone said. ''Don't lump them together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gifts that exceed the $13,000 threshold are supposed to be reported to the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span>. Your lifetime gift total is applied toward any exclusion allowed under the estate tax after your death. Lending institutions aren't responsible for reporting large gifts, but individual donors are. And while it might seem easy to skirt this requirement, Mr. Mignone doesn't advise it. ''It's like anything with the I.R.S.,'' he said. ''If you get audited, you'd better have done it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Contracts for home resales hit a two-and-a-half-year high in November and factory activity in the Midwest expanded this month, suggesting some economic strength despite the threat of tighter fiscal policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Friday that its pending home sales index, based on contracts signed last month, increased 1.7 percent[http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2012/10/november-pending-home-sales-rise-again] to 106.4, the highest level since April 2010, when the homebuyer tax credit expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November was the third consecutive month of gains for signed contracts, which become sales after a month or two. There was a 5 percent rise in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed that the Institute for Supply Management’s Chicago business barometer rose to 51.6[https://www.ism-chicago.org/chapters/ism-ismchicago/files/ChicagoPMI-12-12.pdf] in December, from 50.4 in November. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the regional economy. It was the second consecutive month of growth and was driven by a rebound in new orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data suggested that some of the growth momentum from the third quarter carried into the final three months of 2012, even as businesses and households braced for sharp cuts in government spending and higher taxes in the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data in the fourth quarter, including consumer spending, housing, employment and various manufacturing indicators, have been fairly upbeat so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don’t see much evidence that the economy was slowing as we headed into the end of the year, but everything could change on Jan. 1,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are fears that budget talks in Washington will fail to prevent $600 billion in government spending cuts and higher taxes, which could tip the economy back into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is nothing here to suggest that the economy has enough momentum to withstand the shock if we go over the fiscal cliff with no quick return,” Mr. Ryding said. “The good news right now is it looks like we could have the mid-2s kind” of G.D.P. growth in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the third quarter. The latest Reuters survey of economists put fourth-quarter G.D.P. growth at a 1.2 percent rate, with the decline a result mostly of Hurricane Sandy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/hurricanes_and_tropical_storms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], which struck the East Coast in late October, and of cutbacks in business spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the employment gauge in the I.S.M.-Chicago survey fell to a three-year low in December, economists expect a rebound given the strength in new orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The drop in employment reflects the weakness in new orders in November and, to a lesser degree, the fiscal cliff,” said Eric Green, an analyst at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York. “With the bounce-back in new orders, employment will also bounce back.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending home sales report indicated a strengthening in the housing market recovery. Contracts were up 9.8 percent in the 12 months through November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has turned a corner after the collapse that dragged the economy through its worst recession since the Great Depression[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/g/great_depression_1930s/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales and prices are rising, encouraging builders to pursue new construction projects. Home resale contracts were up in three of the country’s four regions, and steady in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The housing revival seems to be happening in a way that puts some positive feedback loop, a virtuous cycle, into the economy,” said Jerry Webman, chief economist at OppenheimerFunds.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks fell for a fifth day, the longest such streak since July, on concern that lawmakers in Washington would fail to reach a budget deal before a year-end deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average dropped 158.20 points to 12,938.11, with losses accelerating in the last 20 minutes of trading as reports circulated that President Obama would not be making a new budget proposal in a meeting with Congressional leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index fell 15.67 points to 1,402.43, its longest losing streak in three months, and the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite index fell 25.59 points to 2,960.31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The reality, late in the day, is that a deal is just not going to get done,” said Ryan Detrick, a senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “We could be greeted by a big sell-off at the start of January.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama returned from a Christmas break in Hawaii to meet with Congressional leaders at the White House in the hopes of preventing across-the-board tax increases and government spending cuts beginning Jan. 1. Economists have said that if those measures are put in place, it could push the economy back into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders have been focusing on Washington and the budget negotiations since the Nov. 6 elections returned a divided government to power. Stocks closed lower Thursday but erased most of an early loss after Republicans said they would reconvene the House of Representatives on Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I can’t wait till this is done, so we can start talking about markets again and not just about politics,” said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at <span class="companylink">ING Investment Management</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cote said that he expected that lawmakers would not reach a deal before the deadline and that when people assessed the extent of tax increases on the way, “the market is going to reel.” Mr. Cote also expected slowing earnings growth to drag down stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the fiscal gridlock in Washington, major stock indexes are holding on to gains for the year. The Dow is up 5.9 percent, the S. &amp; P. 500 is 11.5 percent higher, and the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> is up 13.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks rose in 2012 on optimism that a recovery in the housing market, coupled with an improving job market, would support economic growth. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> had also extended its bond-buying program, which is intended to lower borrowing costs and encourage spending and investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While stocks declined on Friday, reports suggested the outlook for the economy was improving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes increased last month to its highest level in two and a half years, the latest sign of improvement in the once-battered housing market. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Friday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index rose to its highest reading since April 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management’s Chicago-area purchasing managers index for December came in at 51.6, beating estimates for a gain to 51.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond prices rose as investors moved money into defensive investments. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 9/32 to 99 10/32 and the yield fell to 1.70 percent from 1.73 percent late Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock in <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span>, the computer and printer maker, fell 36 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $13.68 after the company said the Justice Department was investigating its software unit Autonomy. H.P. bought Autonomy for $10 billion in 2011 and has accused the company’s former management of falsifying its accounting before the acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">H.P. has lost almost half of its market value this year, making it the biggest decliner among the 30 stocks in the Dow average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Barnes &amp; Noble</span> shares rose 62 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $14.97 after the British publishing and education company Pearson said it was making an $89.5 million investment in the company’s Nook Media division.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Vento knew exactly how much his home was worth. The retired New York City police officer put his two-family house in the New Dorp Beach area of Staten Island on the market for $580,000 in February. Soon after, he refused an offer of $510,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was before Mr. Vento and his wife watched from the top floor as 10 feet of water ruined the home in which they had raised their three children. Last week, he sold it for $279,000, less than half his original asking price, unable to wait for a better offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was fortunate to get what I got,” he said. “I’m 72 years old. What am I going to do? Wait until I’m 82? By that time I’d be living in a nursing home.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market along the New York and New Jersey coastlines has been as upended by Hurricane Sandy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/hurricanes_and_tropical_storms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] as the houses tossed from their foundations. In places where waterfront views once commanded substantial premiums, housing prices have tumbled amid uncertainty about the costs of rebuilding and the dangers of seaside living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners have had to decide quickly whether to sell out or pour more money in to fix storm-damaged homes, as the real estate speculators who have descended on these areas make offers that would have been preposterous just two months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some owners have indignantly balked and even gone so far as to take houses that were already on the market off, waiting for values to rebound. But many others who lack the means or the desire to rebuild say they have no choice but to try to get out from under these properties for whatever they can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’ve had enough,” said Steve Kaplan, 49, an investment banker from Long Beach, on Long Island, who has been buying damaged properties there since the storm. “They are going to move on, they don’t want to deal, they don’t want to redo their house.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s an opportunity here,” Mr. Kaplan added, “that you can buy houses for cash because they want to move on very quickly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts are divided on whether the effects of the storm on property values reflect a new reality for waterside areas or whether prices will come back stronger, as they did in Lower Manhattan, where prices tumbled after the Sept. 11 attacks. Real estate agents are urging patience, worried that entire communities are hemorrhaging value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, a range of real estate prospectors have arrived. A truck advertising a company that buys distressed homes for cash started patrolling the waterlogged neighborhoods along the Rockaways, in Queens, almost immediately after the storm. Signs offering the services of similar companies have cropped up like crab grass in front of supermarkets on Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there were so many paltry offers for properties on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> that one person posted: “Real estate is high enough and many are trying to suck the life out of people who have lost homes, cars and all their possessions. Where are your hearts and consciences?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the cash-in-hand these companies offer may be too desperately needed for some homeowners to pass up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan Case, a partner at Seaside Funding, a national “flip company” that often offers 60 percent to 70 percent below market rate for properties, acknowledged that would-be sellers would be wise to ignore his agents’ offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are not your best option,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet those who find bargain-basement offers tough to swallow — compared with the value their houses had before the storm — sometimes find themselves with little alternative. Mr. Case recounted how one New Jersey woman reacted with outrage at his company’s offer. “She said, ‘I’ll burn the house before I sell it to you guys to make a profit,’&nbsp;” he said. But she called back a week later to see if the offer still stood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have also been amateur speculators, who see a chance to realize the dream of owning a second home or an investment property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kaplan and his friend Bob Gregor talked for years about buying houses in Long Beach, their hometown. But it was not until a few weeks after the hurricane that they finally went shopping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a drizzly afternoon in December, they were still on the hunt. The men stepped into one storm-shredded house after another. One was stripped to its struts and devoid of furnishing, save a forlorn chandelier hanging from a rafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“How’s the foundation?” Mr. Kaplan asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gregor peered through the chinks between the bare floorboards. “Solid,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had already bought a home in a good part of town, damaged but salvageable and $125,000 below market value. On this afternoon, they were scoping out their second. They said they did not see their purchases as exploitative, but as investments in the community when few people are buying homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because many banks have been unwilling to provide mortgages to people seeking to buy in an area at risk for another catastrophe, or even to refinance properties so homeowners can pay for their own repairs, a cut-price cash sale is sometimes the only option. In some cases that is being held up by the pending release of new flood maps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Rubin, an agent with Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Long Beach, advises clients not to offer or accept rock-bottom prices; he said he feared it could affect long-term property values in the area. Instead, Mr. Rubin subtracts the cost of the needed repairs from what the house’s market value was on Oct. 28, the day before Hurricane Sandy hit. Then he deducts an additional $25,000, what he calls an “inconvenience fee.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this formula does not reflect the realities of the market for every homeowner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the storm, Susan Chenitz’s waterfront five-bedroom home in Rumson, on a peninsula in New Jersey, with “all the bells and whistles,” was listed for $1.85 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After it took on 20 inches of water, she relisted it for $700,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s painful,” Ms. Chenitz, 62, said. “We put it on at an attractive price and hope there is someone willing to take a chance on it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some have decided it is no longer the time to sell. Seventy-one properties have been pulled off the market in the flood zones of Brooklyn and Queens since the hurricane, said Sofia Song, vice president for research at StreetEasy, a listings database. Other listings are being allowed to languish until the surrounding communities are rebuilt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The question is, How long will the experience of Hurricane Sandy be in the mind of homeowners and potential buyers?” said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some deals already in the works have been modified to account for flood damage — or the subsequent repairs. Many more have been scrapped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Howard Beach, Queens, Gerald R. Fink, who runs Jerry Fink Real Estate, recently closed a deal on one home only by lopping off $40,000 — the price of repairing damaged heating and cooling systems. But nearby, Steven Pacchiano, a broker at Connexion I Real Estate Services, raised the price of an older ranch house by $50,000, since the flooded bottom floor is being replaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The first floor is going to be brand new,” he said, explaining that the updated fixtures and a new kitchen that were installed added to the home’s value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Numerous deals have fallen through, as buyers spooked by the devastation have second thoughts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eva Zurek, a longtime real estate broker in Red Hook, Brooklyn, said an artist and his wife had long fixated on moving to the waterfront neighborhood. But they not only retracted their offer to buy a $1.23 million brick town house on Wolcott Street after storm waters tore through the lower floor, but also lost interest in the neighborhood entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They were no longer interested in Red Hook,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other deals have held.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two days after the storm, Joseph Zisa, the city attorney of Hackensack, N.J., called his real estate agent to meet him at the house on the bay in Manahawkin that he was closing on, to see whether it had survived. The porches were gone, and a 107-foot telephone pole lay across the yard, having missed the house by inches. He closed that week at the prestorm price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The view of the water,” he explained. “It’s so special.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some deals already in the works have been modified to account for flood damage -- or the subsequent repairs. Many more have been scrapped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Howard Beach, Queens, Gerald R. Fink, who runs Jerry Fink Real Estate, recently closed a deal on one home only by lopping off $40,000 -- the price of repairing damaged heating and cooling systems. But nearby, Steven Pacchiano, a broker at Connexion I Real Estate Services, raised the price of an older ranch house by $50,000, since the flooded bottom floor is being replaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first floor is going to be brand new,'' he said, explaining that the updated fixtures and a new kitchen that were installed added to the home's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Numerous deals have fallen through, as buyers spooked by the devastation have second thoughts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eva Zurek, a longtime real estate broker in Red Hook, Brooklyn, said an artist and his wife had long fixated on moving to the waterfront neighborhood. But they not only retracted their offer to buy a $1.23 million brick town house on Wolcott Street after storm waters tore through the lower floor, but also lost interest in the neighborhood entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They were no longer interested in Red Hook,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other deals have held.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two days after the storm, Joseph Zisa, the city attorney of Hackensack, N.J., called his real estate agent to meet him at the house on the bay in Manahawkin that he was closing on, to see whether it had survived. The porches were gone, and a 107-foot telephone pole lay across the yard, having missed the house by inches. He closed that week at the prestorm price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The view of the water,'' he explained. ''It's so special.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Homebuilding permits touched their highest level in nearly four and a half years in November, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency said building permits increased 3.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 899,000 units, the highest level since July 2008. That was well above economists' expectations for a rate of 875,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, construction starts fell 3 percent to a rate of 861,000 units. That came after three consecutive months of solid gains and a three-month moving average that showed a firming trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The trend is definitely up. Housing is going to make a small contribution to economic growth in 2012, and I would expect that homebuilding will continue to improve through 2013,'' said Gus Faucher, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services</span> in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While last month's decline in groundbreaking prompted some economists to trim already meager growth forecasts for the fourth quarter, homebuilding is expected to add to economic growth this year for the first time since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12 months through November, housing starts were up 21.6 percent, while permits gained 26.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> showed that demand for home loans fell last week as mortgage rates ticked higher. Applications for loans to buy a home rose in each of the previous five weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though residential construction accounts for only about 2.5 percent of gross domestic product, economists estimate that for every single-family home built at least three full-time jobs are created.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, permits to build single-family homes dipped 0.2 percent to a 565,000-unit pace. Permits for multifamily homes increased 10.6 percent to a 334,000-unit rate, reflecting buoyant demand for rental apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Longer term, we may have seen a shift in psychology, which is putting an extreme pressure on builders to provide multifamily homes. Young families are no longer clamoring to buy,'' said Lindsey M. Piegza, an economist at <span class="companylink">FTN Financial</span> in New York.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JULIE SATOW </div><div>1334 words</div><div>19 December 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ornate cast iron SoHo building known as the King of Greene Street traded hands last week for $41.5 million. The deal was a 47 percent increase in value from when the property at 72-76 Green Street, designed by Isaac F. Duckworth, last sold five years ago. It is also the latest in a torrent of building sales that have taken hold this year in SoHo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, two buildings across the street at 69 and 71-73 Greene Street sold for nearly $33 million, while other recent deals include the sale of a retail condominium at 40 Mercer Street for $57 million and a development site at 144 Spring Street for $26.5 million, according to the brokerage firm RKF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, 38 buildings have traded hands for more than $626 million so far this year in SoHo, which is bounded by Houston Street to the north, Canal Street to the south, Lafayette to the east and West Broadway to the west. This is compared to just eight transactions totaling $64 million in 2009, when the market was at a low, according to data from <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Urban retail in prime Manhattan submarkets like SoHo is trading at well past all-time highs,'' said Dan Fasulo, a managing director at Real Capital. ''There is a wave of capital that wants into this niche, and retailers are increasingly willing to pay rent that justifies some of these high prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 72-76 Greene Street, BSJ Soho, an affiliate of the apparel company Bear U.S.A., sold the property in an all-cash deal for $1,186 a square foot. It purchased the property in 2007 for roughly $28.15 million, or approximately $804 a square foot. The company acquired the building ''at what was perceived as the height of the market,'' said Thomas Hong, managing director of BSJ Soho. ''I think my banker friends thought I was crazy to buy a vacant building at such a high price.'' While at first he was an unmotivated seller, ''in the end, since our original acquisition, we added value to the property and we were satisfied with what we were able to achieve,'' Mr. Hong said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">L3 Capital, a firm based in Chicago, and the investment firm ASB Capital Management bought the building in part to capitalize on 13,000 square feet of vacant retail space there. <span class="companylink">Apple</span> had opened a temporary store at the building while it renovated its Prince Street location, but vacated the space in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacant space includes 3,500 square feet on the ground floor; 3,500 square feet in the basement and the entire 7,000-square-foot second floor, said Adelaide Polsinelli, a senior director at Eastern Consolidated, who represented both the buyer and the seller on the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have been approached by many folks who are interested in the former <span class="companylink">Apple</span> space, but we want to first hire a broker and go out in the market before we sign a lease,'' said Domenic Lanni, a managing principal at L3 Capital. ''We know how valuable the space is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building also includes smaller commercial spaces on the third and fourth floors, as well as the furniture company Dedon, which occupies a second retail space on the ground floor and basement level. The building also has three residential lofts that are approximately 3,000 square feet and are rent-stabilized under the artists' loft law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the street from 72-76 Greene Street, the Highcap Group brokered the sale of two mixed-use buildings at 69 and 71-73 Greene Street in November for $32.6 million. The buildings, which total 32,000 square feet, had been owned for generations by the family of Robert Zeisel. ''There were a lot of buyers interested, big names swirling around, but the seller wanted all cash, no mortgage, and wanted a quick closing,'' said Christen Portelli, a managing principal at the Highcap Group, who declined to name the buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the building sales are taking place along side streets like Greene, Mercer and Wooster Streets, where property values have shot up in recent months. This is because the luxury clothing brands that would normally flock to Prince and Spring Streets are facing little inventory and sky-high rents, and so are now searching out these smaller side streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It used to be that tenants wanted to be on Prince or Spring Street, but now secondary streets like Mercer, Greene and Wooster Streets are the first choice for some retailers,'' said Ariel Schuster, an executive vice president at RKF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The designer Lazaro Hernandez, for example, recently said that his clothing company, Proenza Schouler, wanted to open a second Manhattan outpost in SoHo -- it has a store on Madison Avenue -- and was considering a Greene Street address. Tiffany's recently opened at 97 Greene Street, while Balenciaga and Yves Saint Laurent are opening stores on Mercer Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents on Spring and Prince Streets are roughly $750 a square foot, said Joanne Podell, an executive vice president at the brokerage firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield, while rents on Broadway, which caters to more mainstream, national retailers, ''could reach $1,000 a foot by next summer. That wouldn't be surprising,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents on the side streets range from $200 to $300 a square foot, said brokers. Balenciaga paid just under $200 a square foot for its space at 148 Mercer Street while Yves Saint Laurent paid $200 a square foot for its lease at 149 Mercer Street, according to Joel Isaacs, president of the retail real estate firm Isaacs &amp; Company. Those rents, which were signed last year, would now be closer to $300 a square foot, Mr. Isaacs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market has really shot up in the second half of 2012 because there is a lot less supply and a lot more demand,'' Mr. Isaacs said. On Greene Street specifically, the block between Prince and Spring Street has no retail vacancies, ''so the block north and the block south is really picking up,'' said Mr. Isaacs, who has a lease out on a space he is marketing at 80 Greene Street, between Broome and Spring Streets -- the same block where the latest building sales occurred. He declined to name the tenant, but said rents there were ranging from $250 to $300 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most expensive retail deals this year was the renewal by John Varvatos of a space at 122 Spring Street, at the corner of Greene Street. ''The landlord was asking $800 and I think they got close,'' said Ms. Podell, adding that, ''the fact it is a renewal means he knows what kind of sales he can generate at the store and so he knows what he can afford to pay. Clearly this number made sense to him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But though rents are rising across the neighborhood, they don't necessarily justify the sale prices of the buildings, said Mr. Schuster at RKF. ''The market in SoHo is somewhat abnormal -- instead of looking at the market and recent comps, investors are betting more on future growth,'' he added. ''There are 10 or 15 guys who want to be on Greene Street, but there are only three spaces available; that is what they are looking at.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the sales prices may be high, the upswing will probably continue. ''SoHo is a very tight market -- the amount of square footage is less than the Roosevelt Field Mall,'' said Steven E. Baker, the president of the Winick Realty Group, referring to the popular Long Island mall. ''It is the first choice of tourists and New Yorkers alike and retailers want and need to be there.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By SAM ROBERTS </div><div>831 words</div><div>18 December 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>28</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this were a docudrama, it might be called "A Bridge Too Far." If it were a television game show, it would be "The $4 Billion Question." Instead, it's a timely real-life, stranger-than-fiction answer to a decades-old anomaly: Why did New York State build the Tappan Zee Bridge at one of the wider points on the Hudson River?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is more than a mere historical footnote. It is integral to why the planned replacement for the decrepit 56-year-old span that connects Westchester and Rockland Counties is expected to cost more than $4 billion and why visionary state officials are now stuck with what may seem like a short-sighted political decision made a half century ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At roughly $250,000 a linear foot, the difference between a three-mile-long-bridge at the gaping mouth of Tappan Bay and one farther south where the river narrows to just a mile or two in width is apparent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the bridge is already stretched beyond its projected 50-year lifespan and carries 40 percent more vehicles daily than the 100,000 originally anticipated, the Cuomo administration is accelerating its replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the state's Thruway Authority voted to accept a $3.1 billion bid from a consortium called Tappan Zee Constructors. Another $600 million or so will be spent on managing and financing the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The old Tappan Zee Bridge simply wasn't built to last or serve the growing region around it which is why Governor Cuomo is building a 21st century bridge that will ease congestion, include a path for pedestrians and bikers, be mass transit ready and be built to last over 100 years without major repair," Brian Conybeare, a special adviser to the governor, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new twin-span, to begin construction in 2013 and completed about six years later, will have eight traffic lanes (instead of seven), shoulders and an emergency lane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Pataki administration announced plans for a replacement in 1999, Mr. Cuomo's office said, the state has held 430 public meetings, explored 150 concepts and spent $88 million without agreeing on a final plan, much less beginning construction. Building a replacement bridge or tunnel further south where the river narrows was not considered a practical option for two reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, it would leave the existing two links of the New York State Thruway, in Tarrytown and South Nyack, dangling fecklessly at the shoreline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, second, it might prompt a jurisdictional dispute with the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span> - just the sort of conflict that resulted in the original decision by Gov. Thomas E. Dewey, to build the bridge at Tarrytown, the river's second widest spot after nearby Haverstraw Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, the debate can be traced to 1890 when Congress chartered a private company to build a toll bridge across the Hudson. It never happened. The company's proposal to span the river from West 57th Street was finally abandoned in the 1930s after objections from Manhattan property-owners and from the <span class="companylink">Port Authority</span>, which argued that it would obstruct navigation and compete with revenues from the new George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In mapping the proposed Thruway less than two decades later, transportation planners had several options and a more sparsely populated canvas than they do today. They could go due south from Albany and connect with the New Jersey Turnpike, or cross the river into Westchester to link with the New England Thruway. Dewey favored the New England connection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the <span class="companylink">Port Authority</span> was mulling another bridge of its own near Dobbs Ferry, just across from the New Jersey border and where the river is only about a mile wide. The Dobbs Ferry site was within the 25-mile radius from the Statue of Liberty, which defined the authority's domain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thruway engineers asked the authority to waive its jurisdiction, but were told that its bondholders had been promised that the authority would have exclusive rights to construct a Hudson River bridge or tunnel within its own territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dewey was not inclined to share toll revenue with New Jersey and wanted all the tolls from a new bridge reserved to help finance the Thruway. He vetoed the <span class="companylink">Port Authority</span> plans to build a span of its own, and decided to place the new bridge as far south as possible, but just outside (by less than a mile) the authority's turf on a site that 14 years before had been deemed too expensive and "beyond any self-liquidating possibility."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHETHER it's the best of times, or times are just O.K., could depend on whom you ask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts see the recent trend of buying homes from floor plans as a sign that the market is fully back. Case in point: the mad dash for units at One57, the new Midtown condominium that is still an active construction site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others see a different reality, in which buyers are still skittish, and they cite the mixed bag of statistics from third-quarter sales -- some activity up, some prices down -- to prove their point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some developers have a plan to get those reluctant buyers off the fence. They're dangling incentives, or discounts paid by the developer at closing, to seal the deal on apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They can get buyers across the finish line,'' said Eric Benaim, the chief executive of Modern Spaces, a brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be fair, Manhattan's trendiest new condos aren't bending over backward to get buyers in the door.But some condos that tailor to middle-income buyers or are in still-gentrifying neighborhoods have again embraced the idea that every little enticement helps, especially with hard-to-unload remaining units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Benaim is relying on incentives to help wrap up a pair of projects in Long Island City, Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At L Haus, at 11-02 49th Avenue, buyers receive a credit equal to 6 percent of the unit's cost when completing a purchase, though it can be applied only to closing expenses. Under different circumstances the credit might have been just 5 percent, Mr. Benaim said, but the Stahl Organization, the developer, raised the amount to cover the state's so-called mansion tax, which is a 1 percent charge on any sale for $1 million and up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modern Spaces, which took over sales in January after replacing <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, started the incentive program in August. At the time, 20 of 123 units remained; since then 19 have sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers temporarily suspended the program in September and October, which are normally strong sales months, but Mr. Benaim said buyers of six units told him that the incentives were the reason they took the plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incentive program at the Murano, at 519 Borden Avenue, takes a looser approach. At closing, buyers receive a 5 percent check from the development team, Hudson Equities and Jim Plotkin, and it has no strings attached. In other words, the money doesn't have to be spent on closing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can use it to buy a car if you want to,'' said Mr. Benaim, who added that the credit applied only to two-bedrooms, since they are harder to sell in that market than one-bedrooms. The two-bedrooms cost $670,00 to $970,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incentive program, which began in October, hasn't found any takers, but Hurricane Sandy deterred buyers last month, he added. The Murano, which opened in 2010, has 11 of its 76 units left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, incentives help sell units that are on top floors, which are usually the most expensive, or on the bottom floors, which can lack light and views, said Richard Steinberg, a broker with Warburg Realty who handled sales at Twenty9th Park Madison. At 39 East 29th Street, the condomimium, developed by the Spanish company Espais Promociones Immobiliárias, started sales in 2007 but struggled to move its 144 units during the recession and its aftermath, Mr. Steinberg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Espais began offering to pay for transfer taxes and lawyer fees. The result was a speedy eight sales in six months, to wrap up the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Meier, a <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> broker, has a bigger hill to climb with MeadowWood at Gateway in East New York, Brooklyn, but incentives are helping. For years, Fillmore Real Estate was in charge of sales at the 19-tower, 1,152-unit condo near the Belt Parkway, which <span class="companylink">Taconic Investment Partners</span> converted from a 1960s rental complex. Over that period, Fillmore sold an average of seven units a month, for a total of about 500 units, Mr. Meier said. Apartments at MeadowWood, which have granite counters and bamboo floors, start at around $120,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since September, when <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> came aboard, the sales rate has shot up to 16 a month, an increase that Mr. Meier attributed to incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Fillmore had offered seller's concessions of up to 6 percent of the sale price to be spent on closing costs, <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> came up with new ways of allocating the money. Among them are programs that cover common charges in advance as well as a ''1-1-1 buydown,'' which pays the equivalent of one point of a buyer's mortgage interest rate for the first three years. On a typical three-bedroom at MeadowWood, that can translate into more than $10,000 in savings, Mr. Meier said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incentives may take money out of developers' pockets, he said, but ''you would spend the money on advertising anyway.''</p>
<p>INCENTIVES OFFERED: At L Haus in Long Island City, buyers receive a credit equal to 6 percent of a unit's cost, though it can be applied only to closing expenses. Nineteen units have sold since the incentive program began in August. (PHOTOGRAPH BY JULIE GLASSBERG FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the real estate investment manager Jamestown Properties began renovating a massive old Sears warehouse in Atlanta last year, it had a good idea of what it wanted to create: a bustling urban hub with 440,000 square feet of offices, 330,000 square feet of shops and 259 residential units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The composition of the residential piece, however, remained a question. Would it be all rentals or a mix of condominiums and rentals? If a mix, what blend would perform best in a sluggish housing market characterized by scarce mortgage financing for condo buyers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, thanks to a recent <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> rule change aimed at supporting mixed-use properties, condos are getting more serious consideration in the $200 million development, known as Ponce City Market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We continue to assess the right mix of what those units should be,'' said Katharine Kelley, director of Jamestown's development and construction division. ''But the new F.H.A. ruling strengthens the attractiveness of condos as an option, because it increases the field of potential condo buyers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enacted in September, the rule change opens the door to government-insured mortgages for condos in mixed-use buildings with commercial footprints of up to 35 percent, up from the previous 25 percent limit. Exceptions may be granted for projects in which as much as half of the space is commercial. Developers hope this, along with other F.H.A. changes, will help revive condo sales just as the overall housing market is improving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.H.A., created in 1934, insures mortgages and offers programs that focus largely on first-time home buyers. Its support allows lenders to offer favorable mortgage terms, with down payments as low as 3.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the agency and the government-sponsored entities <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> now back 95 percent of residential mortgages -- roughly double their share before the financial crisis -- certification from one of them is considered critical to the success of residential developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the case even though <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> are in conservatorship and an independent audit of the F.H.A. has projected a $16.3 billion loss for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, leading to speculation that the agency will need a taxpayer bailout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have to think three steps ahead as to how the condo buyer is going to get their financing,'' Ms. Kelley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.H.A.'s mixed-use change is part of a broader shift in condo policy. In September, the agency increased the number of units that investors can own in a development to 50 percent from 10 percent, provided that the other half are owner-occupied, and it relaxed personal liability rules related to condo association boards and officers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers and others say that in addition to strengthening home sales, the changes represent a vote of confidence in the creation of sustainable, pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods, which are more likely to have projects that incorporate mixed-use buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend toward such development has grown in recent years, as younger and older people alike have migrated to urban centers to be close to jobs, cultural amenities and entertainment, said Peter D. Cummings, chairman of Ram, a Florida-based mixed-use developer focused on the Southeast and Michigan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That ''back to the city'' movement is now spilling into the suburbs, said John K. McIlwain, senior resident fellow at the Urban Land Institute, a nonprofit research organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've learned that this mixing of development makes for a better urban design, so towns and cities are designing codes to encourage it, and the market is showing interest,'' he said. ''We're going to see a lot more mixed use, whether it's in the urban central city or suburban town centers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.H.A.'s mixed-use rules date to its inception and the growth of federal housing initiatives, according to the Chicago-based Congress for the New Urbanism, which promotes pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use neighborhoods. The rules stemmed from fears that one component of a mixed-use development could fail and place strain on others to maintain the property, a concern revived by the housing crash in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We understand that risk has to be assessed somehow, but associating it with commercial is just not the right way to do it,'' said Ben Schulman, a spokesman for the Congress for the New Urbanism, which led the push for the rule changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the rules have existed for decades, the F.H.A. started enforcing them only after the housing market crashed, developers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, the developer David Mayfield began building Afton Village, a $160 million, pedestrian-friendly neighborhood in Concord, N.C., about 20 miles northeast of Charlotte. After building single-family homes, town houses and commercial spaces, Mr. Mayfield began developing properties with condos atop retail on the main streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He first put up a mixed-use building with 20 condos, and then shifted to a smaller design that featured three condos. But shortly after he completed his second three-unit version in 2007, the F.H.A. essentially stopped insuring condo mortgages in mixed-use buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As soon as they started enforcing the rule, it made it virtually impossible for our condo buyers to obtain conventional financing,'' Mr. Mayfield said. ''It really put the kibosh on that property type.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, Mr. Mayfield had planned to build eight more of the compact mixed-use structures, but he has reduced that number to two. Even with the relaxed rules, he said, the climate for condo sales and construction lending needs to improve before he will pursue further development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kelley, the Jamestown director, ran into the same problem as chief executive of Green Street Properties, a firm focused on sustainable development that Jamestown bought in 2008. In 2002, Green Street began developing Glenwood Park, a $150 million neighborhood on a former concrete recycling site two miles east of downtown Atlanta. Today it includes homes, stores, offices, parks and other amenities on 28 acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, Green Street began selling the first of 83 condos, most of which would be in five low-rise buildings with ground-floor shops, Ms. Kelley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when conventional credit dried up a couple of years later and left government loan programs as one of the few options available to buyers, the F.H.A. notified the developer that the commercial space exceeded the 25 percent limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It became extremely difficult for buyers to obtain low-down-payment mortgages,'' Ms. Kelley said. ''Most purchasers were first-time home buyers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.H.A.'s enforcement of the rules not only gutted financing for new buyers, but also stifled resales because banks were reluctant to make loans in developments without agency certification, Mr. Mayfield and Ms. Kelley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the rule changes, regulatory obstacles to mixed-use development remain, Mr. Schulman said. For example, neither <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> nor <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> will certify mixed-use projects that contain more than 20 percent commercial space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, mixed-use developers have placed commercial and residential components in separate condo associations to get around the restrictions. <span class="companylink">East West Partners</span> did just that in its East 54 project, a pedestrian-oriented neighborhood in its hometown, Chapel Hill, N.C. The 11-acre luxury development includes a hotel, offices and mixed-use retail and condo buildings with a commercial footprint approaching 50 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> certification, East West has sold 90 percent of its 130 condos in the last few years. But it plans to build rental units instead in its Obey Creek project, a proposed 124-acre, mixed-use neighborhood in Chapel Hill, said Roger Perry, the firm's president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sluggish condo market is one reason, he said. The fact that <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> will not certify a condo project until 70 percent of the units are sold is another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In today's environment, there won't be any condos at Obey Creek,'' Mr. Perry said. ''Until regulations change and the condo market comes back, we'll be building rental.''</p>
<p>In developing Ponce City Market in Atlanta, Jamestown Properties has considered condos more seriously since rules for mixed-use projects were relaxed. (PHOTOGRAPH BY RAYMOND McCREA JONES FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- For more than a decade, civic leaders and developers here have envisioned a large-scale redevelopment of downtown Los Angeles's main civic and cultural thoroughfare, Grand Avenue. This past summer, the first -- and smallest -- component of this vision finally opened to the public. But instead of a massive mixed-use edifice that would completely change the streetscape, it was a modest 12-acre space named Grand Park, which replaced an existing but unwelcoming civic center plaza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The park was paid for by $50 million from Related Companies, the developer planning the nearby building projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community leaders, real estate magnates and urban planners hope the Grand Avenue Development Project, which would add several million square feet of commercial and cultural space, will provide a center of gravity and excitement to an area of the city that has lacked both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Related's plans for a mixed-use building modeled loosely on its Time Warner Center in New York, which houses a hotel, retail stores, offices, condominiums and a major jazz stage, have been delayed. But a $130 million modern art museum, housing the collection of and paid for by the philanthropist Eli Broad and designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, was under construction and planned for completion by early 2014. Related also recently broke ground on a 24-story, 271-unit luxury rental building adjacent to the Broad museum, with 20 percent of the units designated as affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The park was supposed to be part of a later phase of development, said Bill Witte, president and chief executive of Related California. But that changed when the recession struck, undermining the condo sales market that was a bedrock of Related's vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the fate of the mixed-use linchpin of the broad scheme is uncertain. Related has until February 2013 to come up with financing, which will almost certainly be prohibitively costly in the current market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related won the right to build the project in 2004. In theory, though, it could lose that right, and a new selection process could be started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gloria Molina, a Los Angeles County supervisor who is widely credited with pushing for redevelopment of the old civic center mall and for getting Related to pay for it, was doubtful that Related can move forward as planned. ''I don't see the economy shaping up that quickly,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Molina was, perhaps, looking for Related to alter its proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm hoping they will have something more realistic and attainable,'' she said. ''I'm not sure the original vision will be sustainable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Witte said that Related had applied for an extension on its February deadline from the city and county's joint powers authority, but declined to comment other than to say ''we are very committed to getting this done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite clusters of skyscrapers and civic buildings that house some half-million workers in downtown Los Angeles, the area contained fewer than 20,000 residents in the late 1990s, according to the Downtown Los Angeles Center Business Improvement District. New or renovated apartment buildings began to open early in the new decade, and today's population is just under 50,000. Downtown also has the Staples Center, which anchors the LA Live entertainment district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed Related project is meant to dovetail with the Frank Gehry-designed <span class="companylink">Disney</span> Concert Hall, which opened in 2003 at the summit of Grand Avenue. Farther down the avenue, the Music Center also welcomed the idea of an expanded consumer base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At present, the park stands alone. It was designed by the Los Angeles-based landscape architects Rios Clementi Hale Studios, a firm that had already directed an expansion and renovation of the sidewalks and walkways that are part of the Music Center complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Music Center has a pivotal role in the future of the park: event programming. Thor Steingraber, vice president for programming at the center, said he loved the flexibility afforded by the park for things like impromptu concerts. ''You can have a family event at 11 a.m. and a serious concert at 7 p.m.,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To underscore the park's special characteristics, the inaugural event featured Bandaloop, a professed vertical dance company of aerialists, performing against the backdrop of Los Angeles City Hall. The event drew 5,000 spectators, said Mr. Steingraber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As most audiences are expected to do, this one gathered on the ''Event Lawn,'' one of several programmable spaces in the park, which drops about 90 feet in grade from its highest point along Grand Avenue to its lowest, three blocks away at Spring Street. Other spaces include a Performance Lawn, a Community Terrace and a Flag Garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tony Paradowski, a designer on the project at Rios Clementi Hale Studios, said that the landscape had been divided into ''24 floristic gardens'' containing plants from around the globe, ''based loosely on where Los Angeles' population has come from,'' he said. That intermingling was meant to embody the park's role as a mixing point for downtown's residents, workers and tourists. Much of the park's design was generated through a series of community meetings, said Mr. Paradowski.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They were some pretty simple things -- a place to read a book, some shade, open space, get some food,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there is a small dog run -- requested by community members -- there is no playground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Molina said: ''No, we don't have monkey bars. It's not that kind of a facility. The whole place is a playground.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she saw significant possibilities for expansion, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The multiple entities behind the park -- city, county, Music Center -- have applied for an additional $11 million in grant financing. In addition, the county was negotiating to buy a state-owned land parcel adjacent to the park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the future, Ms. Molina has her eye on two hulking civic buildings also adjacent to the park that she says are ''old and antiquated and need to be torn down. They are compromised in many ways and not useful in any way.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the deal that helped sink <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>. Now, it will play an important role in paying off the failed investment bank's creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lehman estate agreed on Monday to sell Archstone, a sprawling apartment complex company, to its two biggest real estate rivals - <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, a company run by the investor Samuel Zell, and <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span> - for about $6.5 billion in cash and stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale will dispose of the Lehman estate's single biggest asset as it continues efforts to wind itself down and pay off the firm's legions of creditors. And it will end the estate's plans to take Archstone public, which had been expected to raise $3.45 billion in an offering on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the acquisition of Archstone by Lehman came just as the housing market was slipping from its lofty peak, its sale follows a recovery from the market's lows. Residential apartment values have surpassed their 2007 peak, and occupancy rates are strong. Still, the market for rental apartments has taken a breather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the collapse of its Wall Street parent, Archstone has been held in high regard among investors and analysts for the high quality of its properties and the abilities of its management team. The company, based in Englewood, Colo., owns or has a stake in 181 developments with 57,948 apartment units, as of Sept. 30. Its apartments are largely in metropolitan areas in the Northeast, California and southeast Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Archstone is a highly sophisticated and very well thought-of manager of apartment assets," said Craig Leupold, the president of Green Street Advisors, a research firm. "If it's not the highest-quality portfolio around, it's certainly up there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than four years ago, it was a millstone around the neck of a foundering Lehman. In 2007, the Wall Street firm teamed up with Tishman Speyer to buy Archstone for more than $23 billion, having triumphed in a contest for one of the nation's premier apartment landlords. The deal was led by Mark Walsh, then Lehman's head of real estate and considered one of the smartest investors on Wall Street, fond of complex transactions that yielded big profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it meant taking on huge amounts of debt as the housing boom was showing signs of deflating, leaving Lehman significantly weakened as the market turmoil was escalating in 2008. Lehman filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15 of that year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the bankruptcy and as Lehman emerged with a liquidation plan earlier this year, Archstone was identified as an asset that could yield a significant payday for creditors. Even as the Lehman estate sold off other high-quality holdings, including the asset manager <span class="companylink">Neuberger Berman</span>, it held onto Archstone. It also sold off about $3.6 billion worth of lower-quality assets from the Archstone business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock component of the transaction announced on Monday will give make the Lehman estate the single biggest investor in <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, with a 9.8 percent stake, and in AvalonBay, with a 13.2 percent stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business attracted suitors, and one of the most persistent was <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, which had long followed the path set by Mr. Zell: serial deal-making that made it one of the biggest apartment investors in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another was AvalonBay, an apartment company known for developing properties rather than buying them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both companies began talking to the Lehman estate as far back as the summer of 2011, though the talks were in fits and starts, according to people with direct knowledge of the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the primary concerns within the Lehman real estate team was fetching the highest possible value for Archstone. And that meant buying out the other partners in Archstone: <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman spent about $2.88 billion to acquire their stakes earlier this year to simplify matters for any new owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet at the same time, the estate also began an initial offering process for Archstone in case the sales talks broke down. An I.P.O. would have been one of the biggest staged this year, trailing only the likes of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, talks between Lehman and the real estate investors picked up steam, these people said. The partnering of <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> and AvalonBay proved especially reassuring, as it reduced the risks that either company would have taken on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So while Lehman periodically updated Archstone's offering documents - the most recent update was filed with regulators just last week - teams worked around the clock to secure a transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lehman team finally breathed a sigh of relief when most of the major legal paperwork was signed around 1:30 a.m. on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the terms of the deal, <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> and AvalonBay will pay $2.685 billion in cash and about $3.8 billion in stock. That represents a roughly 17 percent premium to what Lehman had valued the company earlier this year. The two companies will also assume Archstone's roughly $9.5 billion in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, which is run by Mr. Zell, will own about 60 percent of Archstone's assets and liabilities. AvalonBay will own the remainder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In return, the Lehman estate will become the single biggest shareholder in each company, holding a 9.8 percent stake in <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> and a 13.2 percent stake in AvalonBay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The sale of Archstone to <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> and Avalon Bay is a very positive outcome for our creditors," Owen Thomas, the chairman of Lehman's board of directors, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Lehman real estate team's work is not finished: the estate still owns several major properties in New York City and on the West Coast that must be sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street halted its two-day rally on Tuesday, after Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said that the central bank lacked the tools to cushion the United States economy from the impact of spending cuts and tax increases to take effect next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke, in comments before the Economic Club of New York, said that the Fed did not have the ability to offset the damage that would result if politicians failed to reach a deal to prevent a series of mandatory tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to go into effect early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His statement caused a downdraft in the market, though the equity market cut most of its losses before the end of the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a more realistic and pragmatic picture of where we are, compared to what we’ve been hearing for the past couple of days from politicians,” said James Dailey, portfolio manager at TEAM Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks rallied for the last two sessions after Washington politicians sounded an encouraging note that a deal on fiscal issues could be reached. Those two days of gains came after two weeks of sharp losses that pushed the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index down through the 200-day moving average, a crucial benchmark of the market’s long-term trend. The S.&amp; P. ended Tuesday near that level, which was 1,382.68.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average slipped 7.45 points, or 0.06 percent, to close at 12,788.51. But the S.&amp; P. 500 and <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> each rose, albeit barely. The S.&amp; P. gained 0.07 percent, to 1,387.81. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite index rose 0.02 percent, to 2,916.68.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day’s biggest disappointment was Hewlett-Packard[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/hewlett_packard_corporation/index.html?inline=nyt-org], whose stock sank to a 10-year low after the company swung to a fourth-quarter loss and announced a $5 billion charge related to “accounting improprieties.” H.P. stock slid 12 percent to close at $11.71.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">H.P., whose stock is one of 30 on the <span class="companylink">Dow</span>, said it took an $8.8 billion charge in the quarter, with $5 billion related to its acquisition of the software maker Autonomy, citing “serious accounting improprieties.” H.P.’s market value is now $23 billion, compared with $100 billion just two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> fell 13 percent after the company reported a net loss of $13 million for the third quarter on weaker-than-expected sales at its established stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor weighing on stocks was the reduction of France’s sovereign rating by <span class="companylink">Moody’s Investors Service</span>, a move announced after the market’s close on Monday. <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> cited an uncertain fiscal outlook as a result of the weakening economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This brings forward a whole new set of problems to the euro zone issue,” Mr. Dailey said. “When the lifeguards — in this case, Germany and France — are in trouble, when they need to save people like Greece and Spain, that could be a big concern.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Tuesday, data showed that United States housing starts rose to their highest rate in more than four years in October, suggesting that the housing market’s recovery was gaining momentum, even though permits for future construction fell. An index of housing-related shares shot up 2.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advancers outnumbered decliners on the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span> by a ratio of about 4 to 3. On <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span>, the opposite trend took hold, with about 13 stocks falling for every 12 that rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 16/32, to 99 20/32, and the yield rose to 1.67 percent, from 1.61 percent late Monday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders in the United States started construction last month on the most homes and apartments since July 2008, more evidence that the housing recovery was gaining momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Tuesday that builders broke ground on homes in October at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 894,000. That’s a 3.6 percent gain from September[http://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home construction dipped 0.2 percent to an annual rate of 594,000, down from a four-year high in the previous month. Apartment construction, which is more volatile from month to month, rose 10 percent to an annual rate of 285,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for building permits, a sign of future construction, fell 2.7 percent to 866,000, after jumping 12 percent in September to a four-year high. Still, permit applications to build single-family homes rose to their highest level since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The overwhelming trend here is a housing market that has clearly shifted into recovery mode,” Robert Kavcic, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts were 87 percent above the annual rate of 478,000 in April 2009, the recession low. But it was still short of the 1.5 million annual rate considered healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hurricane that struck the Northeast had minimal impact on the October figures, the government said, although it could delay some construction in November. Still, residential construction activity in the region could move higher soon after, when builders begin replacing homes destroyed by the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been making consistent gains this year, helping prop up an economy that is being squeezed by a global slowdown and looming spending cuts and tax increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builder confidence rose to its highest level in six and a half years, according to a survey by the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo. Their index of builder sentiment rose to 46 points this month, up from 41 in October. It was the highest reading since May 2006, just before the housing bubble burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readings below 50 signal negative sentiment about the housing market. The index has been rising since October 2011, when it was 17. It has surged 27 points in the past 12 months, the sharpest annual increase on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though new homes represent less than 20 percent of the housing sales market, they have an outsize impact on the economy. Each home built creates an average of three jobs for a year and generates about $90,000 in tax revenue, according to data from the home builders group.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN his 1995 memoir ''Dreams From My Father,'' Barack Obama described the Yorkville walk-up on 94th Street near First Avenue where he had lived in the 1980s as ''part of the shifting border between East Harlem and the rest of Manhattan.'' Over the last several years, as the latest wave of gentrification has washed north of East 96th Street, breaching a traditional dividing line sometimes called the Wall by East Harlem residents, that boundary has blurred even further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, Lexington Avenue between 96th and 104th Streets has been transformed by the arrival of luxury housing and spiffy lounges. At the East Harlem Cafe, laptop-pecking patrons can dine on a goat cheese and tomato salad called El Barrio, the name by which parts of the neighborhood have been known for decades by its many Hispanic residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Armstead of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, who grew up on East 110th Street, said that one of his condominium sales on 104th and First fell apart last year when the buyer, an investor from New Jersey, learned that the apartment she had chosen was in East Harlem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some Web sites call that area the Upper East Side,'' he said, ''and then she heard somewhere else it was called East Harlem, so she backed out because it confused her.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gentrification has by no means been wholesale; much of the area is still dominated by rows of crumbling tenements and mountain ranges of public housing. In many cases, residents say, multiple immigrant families crowd together in a single one-bedroom unit. But for students of Manhattan's tendency to remake itself block by block, the signs of evolution are evident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Garcia, a manager at a nonprofit group, needs only to gaze from his condo's south-facing terrace to see the change. In 2005, Mr. Garcia and his partner moved from Battery Park City, paying $595,000 for a two-bedroom condo with two baths and two terraces on 112th Street near Thomas Jefferson Park. Next door was an auto body shop, and beyond that a tire repair place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Looking out from our back terrace, there was nothing but public housing back then,'' Mr. Garcia recalled, ''and now I see eight new residential buildings. And the empty lot next to mine is going to be converted into an eight-story condo.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development has been spurred in part by East River Plaza, a long-awaited mall at 116th Street and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive that offers the likes of Target and Old Navy. The increased foot traffic has brought restaurants to the avenues nearby as well as to 116th, which has come to be called Little Mexico. On 119th and Third, Hunter College's graduate school of social work now resides in a shiny new eight-story brick-and-glass building. Along with condos and a graduate center apartment house, the school has drawn a diverse crowd and helped rejuvenate a down-at-heel area of dollar stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a young professional population of every ethnic group,'' Mr. Garcia said, ''and a noticeable, huge increase in the gay population.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But perhaps the greatest leading indicator of cultural transformation can be found at the dog run. ''You can always tell a neighborhood is changing by its dogs,'' Mr. Garcia said. ''When we moved here, they were mostly pit bulls, but now there's every breed, every terrier you can imagine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broadly speaking, East Harlem is made up of the one and a half square miles of Manhattan Island covered by Community Board 11: The area between 96th and 142nd Streets, from Fifth Avenue to the East and Harlem Rivers. These borders can be a subject of disagreement. Some place the northern boundary at 125th Street, the southern edge north of 96th.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly half the area's 101,448 residents are Hispanic or Latino, but from 2000 to 2010 their proportion shrank to 47 percent from 52, according to census data provided by Andrew A. Beveridge, the chairman of the Queens College sociology department. The black population dipped slightly, to 38 percent, while the percentage of non-Hispanic whites rose to 13 from 7 and the share of Asians doubled, to 6 percent. Median household income was $30,833, less than half that of Manhattan households overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">English and Spanish are both widely spoken, but the background of those speaking the Spanish has changed. The proportion of Puerto Ricans, the area's dominant group by the 1950s, was just a quarter of the 2010 population, while an influx of Mexicans and Dominicans brought the reported share of each of those groups to 8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most East Harlemites live in some form of rent-regulated housing, and the neighborhood has one of the largest concentrations of public housing in New York. But development pressure is mounting. In 2010 and '11, more new certificates of occupancy were issued in East Harlem than in any other city neighborhood, according to a report by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Sarkissian, the district manager of Community Board 11, said that rising rents had priced some longtime residents out of their own neighborhood. ''We have private equity firms that have bought up large portfolios of low- and middle-income housing at the tail end of their rent-regulatory period,'' he said, and in some cases the buildings have opted out of government rent-regulation programs, bringing some apartments to market rate. ''So there's a bit of tension between people who have been in East Harlem for generations and those who are moving here, although there's no outright conflict.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The community board has made a priority of preserving affordable housing, Mr. Sarkissian added, and it has held discussions with new building owners to try to persuade them to remain for 25 years in the federal Section 8 program, which provides rental payment assistance to low-income New Yorkers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Below-market-rate and mixed-income housing has also been built by private developers making use of government incentives. One of the newest mixed-income co-ops is the eight-story Lancaster Madison, the fourth in a corridor of pleasant brick-and-masonry buildings between 117th and 120th Streets on Madison Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All the brand-new buildings make you feel that people are already investing up here,'' said Enrique Vela, an architect, while taking a break from painting a room for the baby whom he and his wife, Gimar Diaz, are expecting. Last month the couple paid $395,000 for a two-bedroom unit in the Lancaster Madison. ''The neighborhood's not there yet,'' he said, ''but it's getting there, and when it does I think we'll be sitting pretty.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifth Avenue from 96th to 110th Street has several new developments and renovated prewar buildings that sell or rent at heights unheard of elsewhere in East Harlem. Three-bedrooms in 1214 Fifth, a new 53-story glass tower on 102nd, rent for $9,000 a month and up, said Daria Salusbury, a senior vice president of the Related Companies, the building's leasing agent. Condos at One Museum Mile, the tower atop the as-yet-unopened <span class="companylink">Museum for African Art</span> on 110th, command more than $1,000 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of this rarefied corridor, two-bedrooms in luxury condos typically bring around $615,000, said Mr. Armstead of Corcoran, and the pace of sales has picked up markedly since September. A search on Streeteasy.com found 71 residential properties for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-bedrooms in tenements rent for around $2,300, said Dianne Howard, also of Corcoran. Luxury rentals can be had for $2,500 to $3,000 a month, Mr. Armstead said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area boasts some of the best Mexican food in town, at restaurants like El Paso Taqueria. Diverse local favorites include Ricardo Ocean Grill; Harley's Smokeshack; Creole; and Piatto D'Oro, one of whose owners is a former Roman paparazzo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the public elementary schools is the Bilingual Bicultural School on 109th, for kindergarten through fifth grade, which earned an A on its most recent city progress report. Middle schools include the Isaac Newton Middle School for Math and Science on Pleasant Avenue, which scored a C. At the Central Park East High School on Madison, SAT averages last year were 405 in reading, 421 in math and 395 in writing, versus 434, 461, and 430 citywide. The private St. Bernard's School on 98th runs through Grade 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2, 3, 4 and 5 express trains stop at 125th Street. The 6 makes five stops on Lexington from 96th to 125th. The trip from 116th to Grand Central Terminal takes about 20 minutes. From 125th on the 4 or 5, the ride to Wall Street is about 25 minutes. There is a <span class="companylink">Metro-North Railroad</span> station at 125th and Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1930, 80,000 Italians lived in East Harlem; by 2010 that population had dwindled below 1,900. ''My father grew up here in the 1930s,'' said Robert Martinez, the maintenance superintendent at the local Boys' Club of New York, who is of Puerto Rican descent, ''and if you weren't Italian or Irish you couldn't pass Second Avenue toward the East River between 106th and 116th. My dad was very light-skinned, so he was able to filter in with the Italians; our name is Martinez so he called himself Martini.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WITH the election behind us, Wall Street is turning its attention to another suspense thriller: the Washington battle to head off automatic spending cuts and tax increases that could kick the economy into recession next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conventional wisdom is that the fight over this so-called fiscal cliff “may cause investors to sell, and contribute to more volatility in the coming month or two,” said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial[http://www.joinlpl.com/independent-unbiased-research-for-financial-advisors/lpl-independent-research-team.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History shows only that the markets tend to be volatile and unpredictable in the aftermath of close national elections. In election years since 1976, between Election Day and Dec. 31, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index has lost as much as 9.6 percent and gained as much as 7.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, despite the real possibility of economic peril — the Congressional Budget Office predicts that gross domestic product will shrink next year if Congress and the White House can’t reach an agreement — a recession and bear market aren’t the only possible outcomes that investors should brace for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, many economists think that while certain items may be allowed to lapse, like the payroll tax holiday and extended emergency unemployment benefits, they doubt that Congress and the White House would allow the economy to go completely a full fall. In fact, the consensus among forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators is that the economy will avoid recession and grow modestly in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the budget office predicted that the full possible effects of the situation — including the expiration of the so-called Bush tax cuts and automatic spending reductions put in place in last year’s contentious debt-ceiling debate — could shave as much as $800 billion off gross domestic product in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mike Dueker, chief economist for Russell Investments,[https://www.russell.com/us/news/press-release.aspx?link=press-releases/2011/PR20110217.htm] says he thinks policy makers may ultimately reach a fiscal-tightening agreement that will result in a much smaller drag on G.D.P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marie M. Schofield, chief economist at Columbia Management Investment Advisers,[https://www.columbiamanagement.com/market-insights/our-team] agrees that a moderate tightening is likely. “The question in my mind is if this is going to be a fiscal cliff or a fiscal bunny hill,” she said. Rather than let everything expire and kick in, she said, Congress could find a way to postpone certain important decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Congress were to stretch out the crisis over several months, it could mute these problems enough to make them manageable in investors’ minds, said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management[https://www.wellscap.com/people/james_paulsen.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paulsen notes that, like the European debt crisis this year, the situation might turn out to be a series of chronic problems that are dealt with sequentially, not as a single financial disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is some evidence, he says, that the market views the problem in these terms. Despite growing concerns this year, he notes that the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, a closely watched gauge of investor fear, remains below 20, after having approached 50 last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To me, this is evidence that the financial markets are desensitized to this doomsday thinking,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He notes that many elements of the economy are healing in the meantime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The labor markets, for instance, are slowly but surely improving. Consumer confidence is at a five-year high. And the housing market shows clear signs of a rebound. The latest reading of the Case-Shiller Home Price Index, for instance, found that home values in the 20 largest metropolitan markets gained 0.9 percent in August over July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">G. Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist of Brown Brothers Harriman[http://www.bbh.com/wps/portal/ourfirm/contactus/ourpeople/clemonsscott], says the nascent housing recovery is significant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The real engine of economic activity is still personal consumption,” he said. “So the housing and labor markets are the canaries in the coal mine for the economy. As long as those parts of the economy are still chirping, we’re fine.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henry B. Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust[http://www.haverfordquality.com/officers/henry-smith], sees another script to consider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it’s not the most likely outcome, there is a possibility that the debate in Washington will eventually lead to major tax and spending reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under this bullish alternative, he said, the lame-duck Congress finds a way to postpone spending cuts for at least a couple of quarters. Then, beginning next year, the president and Congress tackle spending, taxes and entitlements not in piecemeal fashion, but through a comprehensive tax reform and deficit reduction plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If that were to happen, in our view, you’d see everyone’s 2013 G.D.P. estimates come up,” he said, adding that it would unleash pent-up demand both in the economy and the markets.</p>

</div><div class="author">By PETER EAVIS   </div><div>1207 words</div><div>9 November 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second-term president may be just the person to tackle America's housing problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When President Obama first came into office, home prices were crashing, foreclosures were soaring and the previous Bush administration had just initiated the bailout of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-backed entities that agree to repay mortgages if the original borrower defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the market in shambles in 2009, the Obama administration pursued a tentative housing policy, for the most part avoiding big moves that might have further weakened the housing market or banks. Eventually, there were some bolder initiatives, like the national mortgage settlement with big banks as well as the Treasury Department's aid programs for homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as President Obama's first administration comes to an end, the government is still deeply embedded in the mortgage market. In the third quarter, various government entities backstopped 92 percent of all new residential mortgages, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a publication that focuses on the home loan industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's economic team has consistently said it wants the housing market to work without significant government support. But it has taken few actual steps to advance that idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think Obama is absolutely committed to reducing the government's role," said Thomas Lawler, a former chief economist at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and founder of Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting, an industry analysis firm. "But no one's yet found a format to do that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing policy is hard to tackle because so many people have benefited from the status quo. The entire real estate system - the banks, the agents, the home buyers - all depend on a market that provides fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages that can be easily refinanced when interest rates drop. That sort of loan is rare outside of the United States. And any effort to overhaul housing and the mortgage market could eventually reduce the amount of such mortgages in the country, angering many and creating a political firestorm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, the best person to fundamentally change how housing works may be a president who won't be running for office again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most immediately, the housing market has to be strong enough to deal with a government pullback. Some analysts think it's ready. "I think the housing recovery is far enough along that they can start winding down Fannie and Freddie," said Phillip L. Swagel at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy, who served as assistant secretary for economic policy under Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration can take smaller steps first. Mr. Lawler, the housing economist, thinks the government could start to reduce the maximum amount that it will guarantee for Fannie and Freddie loans. In some areas, like parts of the Northeast and California, it is as high as $625,000. Before the financial crisis, it was essentially capped at $417,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big question is whether the private sector - banks and investors that buy bonds backed with mortgages - will pick up the slack when the government eases out of the market. If they don't, the supply of mortgages could fall and house prices could weaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks say their appetite depends on how new rules for mortgages turn out. In setting such regulations, some tough choices have to be made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rules will effectively map the riskiness of various types of mortgages. In determining that, regulators will look at the features of the loans and the borrowers' income. Banks say they are unlikely to hold loans deemed risky, and their lobbyists are pressing for legal protection on the safer ones, called qualified mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The temptation will be to make the definition of what constitutes a qualified mortgage as broad as possible, to ensure that the banks lend to a wide range of borrowers. But regulators concerned with the health of the banks won't want a system that incentivizes institutions to make potentially risky loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One set of qualified mortgage regulations, being written by the <span class="companylink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span>, could be completed as early as January. Other regulators, like the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, are expected to take longer in finishing their mortgage rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resolving the conflict between mortgage availability and bank strength may depend on the person who replaces Timothy F. Geithner as Treasury secretary. Mr. Geithner is stepping down at the end of Mr. Obama's first term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration faces other daunting decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One is how to deal with the considerable number of troubled mortgages still in the financial system. Banks might be reluctant to make new loans until they have a better idea of the losses on the old loans. "If you don't ever deal with these problems, you may never get to where you want to go," said Mr. Lawler, the housing economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help tackle that issue, the new administration might decide to make its mortgage relief programs more aggressive. It might even aim for more loan modifications, writing down the value of the mortgages to make them easier to pay. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, the regulator that oversees <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, has effectively blocked such write-downs on the vast amount of loans those entities have guaranteed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new Obama administration may move to change the agency's stance on write-downs, perhaps by replacing its acting director, Edward DeMarco. If that happened, it would be a sign that the White House had a taste for more radical housing actions. The agency declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's what to do with the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, another government entity that has backstopped a huge amount of mortgages since the financial crisis. The housing administration was set up to focus on lower-income borrowers, and it backs loans that have very low down payments. Its share of the market has grown since the crisis. The F.H.A. accounted for 13 percent of the market in the third quarter, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new administration has to decide whether it wants the F.H.A. to continue doing as much business. The risk is that a big pullback by the F.H.A. could reduce the availability of mortgages to lower-income borrowers. Banks almost certainly won't want to write loans with minuscule down payments since they are considered riskier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, housing policy comes down to one question: Which borrowers should get the most subsidies?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, the government largess encompasses a wide swath of borrowers. But most analysts believe government support should be focused on lower-income borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We will know that the Obama administration is serious about housing finance reform when it comes up with a proposal for affordable housing," said Mr. Swagel, the University of Maryland professor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF tropical storm Irene last year was an eye-opener, Hurricane Sandy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/hurricanes_and_tropical_storms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] was a reality check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waterfront property in the New York area is some of the most coveted in the nation, but after back-to-back years of supposedly once-in-a-generation storms, public officials, developers, brokers and homeowners are being forced to re-evaluate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although real estate experts say property values are unlikely to suffer in the long term, it is possible that new zoning and planning regulations — and buyers’ expectations — could reshape how residential housing along the water is built, marketed and sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a news briefing on Wednesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said elected officials had a responsibility to consider new ways to prevent similar damage to the region’s infrastructure in the face of future storms. “For us to sit here today and say this is a once-in-a-generation and it’s not going to happen again, I think, would be shortsighted,” he said. “I think we need to anticipate more of these extreme-weather-type situations in the future, and we have to take that into consideration in reforming, modifying, our infrastructure.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, property management companies were just beginning to assess the damage across the region. At least 40 of the 500 buildings that <span class="companylink">Cooper Square Realty</span> manages throughout the five boroughs had “major disasters,” where common areas or equipment sustained significant damage, some with extensive flooding, said David Kuperberg, the firm’s chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Some of our buildings out in Brighton Beach, Coney Island and the Rockaways have part of the boardwalks in their lobbies,” Mr. Kuperberg said. “There is one building that had 24 feet of water in the lobby at one point.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the destruction, those in the industry agree that the urban waterfront will continue to retain its allure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you love living on the water, and you’re willing to take the risk,” said Dottie Herman, the president and chief executive of <span class="companylink">Prudential Douglas Elliman</span>, “waterfront properties always go for a higher premium. Those who buy on the water know the risks ahead of time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said he was confident that the storm would not have a negative impact on overall property values. “It may affect specific homes within buildings or locations which were severely damaged by the storm, but not on the long-term market as a whole.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depending on the pace of the cleanup in hard-hit neighborhoods, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the Miller Samuel appraisal firm, “there may be a lag or delay in that market, but I am extremely skeptical that once this crisis is past there is going to be some sort of structural impact to values.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “I’m always struck by how quickly we forget — the collective memory, whether it’s politics or real estate or anything else. When people are looking at property on the water with beautiful views, all that gets rationalized away.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after the devastating effects of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Mr. Miller noted, “Lower Manhattan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo] is one of the best-performing markets a decade later.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, for now at least, some brokers reported that their buyers were expressing jitters about the waterfront. Dolly Lenz, a high-end broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> in Manhattan, said that even though she was scrambling to get some clients appointments lined up in the wake of the storm, others in flooded areas like Battery Park City were “reassessing whether they want to be there on a long-term basis as they had originally thought.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her advice: “Take a pause, wait a few weeks and see what happens. Those kinds of decisions should not be made in a panic. They’re in a panic. They’re not accustomed to having their life upended that way.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said at least one deal, a $1 million year-round Hamptons rental, had fallen through. Before the storm, her client had “only wanted the primest of prime oceanfront.” Now the priorities have shifted to a home in the estate section farther inland. “They don’t want to put their family and pets in the way of any potential danger,” she said, “and do not wish to pursue the waterfront opportunity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers and developers are anticipating new questions and concerns from buyers regarding waterfront property. “I think people will start looking into the zones a building is in, learning if there is backup power or not in the building, is there a history of flooding etc.,” said David J. Maundrell III, the founder of aptsandlofts.com[http://aptsandlofts.com], a New York brokerage that specializes in new-development marketing. Although he doesn’t expect those concerns to hurt prices, he said, “people will be more cautious and ask more and different questions.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, as Frederick W. Peters, the president of the Manhattan firm <span class="companylink">Warburg Realty Partnership</span>, pointed out, “There’s this funny way in which events of this nature make people more passionately devoted to their communities, and we’ve seen that in New York before.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers should be installing generators in each new building, said Andrew Gerringer, the managing director for new business development of the Marketing Directors, a New York development, leasing and marketing company. “And if you are in a zone that’s prone to flooding,” he added, “the new codes should require that serious drainage should be built in to mitigate the damage that we just witnessed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate veterans looked to more hurricane-prone regions for guidance. “The last two storms have shown we’re not immune to what we think only happens down South,” said Gary L. Malin, the president of Citi Habitats. In Florida[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/florida/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], he noted, “People have lived and learned through so many storms and had the opportunity to make changes where necessary. We have to start following those guides.” Despite the risks, he added, “people will still want to build on the water, but hopefully they will build in different ways.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers have already begun to implement designs that they say could help mitigate damage in similar storms. At the Edge[http://www.williamsburgedge.com/], a more-than-500-unit glass-and-steel residential building on the waterfront in Williamsburg, Brooklyn[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/brooklyn/?inline=nyt-geo], generators are on the eighth floor instead of the basement; hefty precast concrete panels were used on the exteriors to minimize building motion in high winds; and the entrance was built to the highest level of grade possible. The Edge narrowly averted severe damage this time as water breached the bulkheads and came up over the waterfront esplanades, but never reached the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey E. Levine, the chairman of Douglaston Development, said the Edge’s special features could set it apart in the event of a similar storm. Other than a broken window, he said, “there were absolutely no problems whatsoever.” He added, “I think we should probably put signs up in the building: We survived Sandy without a blemish.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with long-term plans to build another tower even closer to the water, Mr. Levine added, further measures are in the pipeline. “Future plans will include well-designed gas turbines which will produce uninterrupted emergency electric power for the building.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) — Home prices rose in August in nearly all American cities, and many of the markets hit hardest during the crisis are starting to show sustained gains. The increases were the latest evidence of a steady housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Standard &amp; Poor’s/Case-Shiller[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/standard_poors_caseshiller_home_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]index that was released on Tuesday showed[http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&amp;blobcol=urldocumentfile&amp;blobtable=SPComSecureDocument&amp;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3Ddownload.pdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobheadername1=content-type&amp;blobwhere=1245342717782&amp;blobheadervalue3=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&amp;blobnocache=true] that national home prices increased 2 percent in August compared with a year earlier. This was the third straight increase and a faster pace than in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also said that prices rose in August from July in 19 of the 20 cities tracked by the index. Prices had risen in all 20 cities in the previous three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities that had experienced some of the worst price declines during the housing crisis are starting to come back. Prices in Las Vegas rose 0.9 percent, the first year-over-year gain since January 2007. Prices in Phoenix are 18.8 percent higher in August than a year earlier. Home values in Tampa and Miami have also posted solid increases over the period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle was the only city to report a monthly decline. Still, prices there fell just 0.1 percent in August from July and are 3.4 percent higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Atlanta have fallen 6.1 percent over the 12 months that ended in August, the largest year-over-year decline. But Atlanta has posted the largest price gain among the 20 cities over the last three months, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a housing analysis firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The sustained good news in home prices over the past five months makes us optimistic for continued recovery in the housing market,” said David Blitzer, chairman of the Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The steady increase in prices has helped many home markets slowly rebound nearly six years after the housing bubble burst, lifted further by the lowest mortgage rates in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller index covers roughly half of American homes. It measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The figures are not seasonally adjusted, so some August gains reflect the benefit of the summer buying season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stan Humphries, chief economist at the housing Web site <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, expects the monthly price figures will decline in the fall and winter. “This doesn’t mean the housing recovery has been derailed,” he said. “This is exactly what bouncing along the bottom looks like.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent reports, on construction and sales, have also shown an improving market, albeit from depressed levels.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span> is adding a new sort of property to its real estate Web site: homes that are bank-owned or are in the foreclosure process but aren't officially listed for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having access to an inventory of "presale" properties -- those that are pending foreclosure or that have already been foreclosed on -- may make it easier to get a jump on properties potential buyers are interested in, said Amy Bohutinsky, Zillow's chief marketing officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the housing market has rebounded, many buyers remain reluctant to put their homes on the market, creating inventory shortages in some housing markets. But millions of homes are about to come on the market for various reasons, Ms. Bohutinsky said, either because the owner has fallen behind on mortgage payments and has been served with a foreclosure notice or the bank has foreclosed but hasn't put the property on the market yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow has gleaned such information on about 1.8 million properties from public records, and is making it available free -- unlike sites for investors, which have traditionally charged a fee. The inventory includes more than 1.5 million properties where the lender has started foreclosure proceedings or an auction has been scheduled, and 250,000 foreclosed properties that aren't yet listed for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The opportunity this represents for buyers is, they could make an offer to the owners or to the bank to buy the home," she said. "Or they could set up alerts to see when it does come on the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if you're not interested in making an offer on a foreclosed property, Ms. Bohutinsky said, it can help to decide on an offer for a home that is listed for sale. If you know that several homes nearby are in foreclosure, you can adjust your offer price accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying homes in foreclosure has traditionally been the realm of investors who are prepared to handle a potentially daunting, complex process. Banks don't necessarily want to sell to buyers who need a mortgage, but prefer investors who can pay cash. Ron Lieber, the paper's Your Money columnist, has written in detail about the challenges of buying a bank-owned home. Proceedings can sometimes be adversarial, since the previous owner usually didn't want to part with the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To address that problem, Zillow can also put consumers in touch with local agents who specialize in foreclosures. (The agents pay Zillow a fee to be listed on the site.) The site has also added a foreclosure primer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's important for the buyer to work with an agent who knows what they're doing,"she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would you consider making an offer on a foreclosed property? Why or why not?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EAGLE GROVE, Iowa -- After initially trickling in slower than the auctioneer's babble, the bids began picking up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Get your hands up,'' belted Marv Huntrods, the auctioneer, his baritone echoing from a raspy speaker in a plaid-carpeted Masonic lodge here last week. He chopped the air with one hand and drew out his vowels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Grains up overnight.'' ''It's only money.'' ''Just tell me, yes or yes.'' ''Last chance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After about 15 minutes and a starting bid of $6,000 per acre, Mr. Huntrods, an agent with Hertz Farm Management, ended up with more than he had expected. A former John Deere dealer bought the 80-acre farm plot at a stunning price of $10,600 per acre. Mr. Huntrods had thought it would fetch less than $9,500 per acre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the nation's Corn Belt, even as the worst drought in more than 50 years has destroyed what was expected to be a record corn crop and reduced yields to their lowest level in 17 years, farmland prices have continued to rise. From Nebraska to Illinois, farmers seeking more land to plant and outside investors looking for a better long-term investment than stocks and bonds continue to buy farmland, taking advantage of low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And despite a few warnings from bankers, the farmland boom shows no signs of slowing. Almost every year since 2005, except during the start of the recession in 2008, agriculture land prices have posted double-digit gains. In the same period, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index has had double-digit gains in only three of those years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An August survey by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago</span> showed a 15 percent increase in farmland prices since last year across a region that covers Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan. Another survey released at the same time from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City</span> showed even higher growth in the Great Plains states, where farmland prices have increased 26 percent since last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two Fed surveys and sales data have raised concerns from bank regulators about a potential farmland bubble, similar to the housing frenzy that helped set off the financial crisis. A year ago, rising farmland prices prompted regulators to warn banks not to relax lending standards. In July, the Kansas City Fed held a symposium to discuss concerns about a bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any time you have an asset that doubles in value over a decade, there is cause for concern about how sustainable that growth is,'' said Richard A. Brown, chief economist at the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For farmers in the land hunt, a potential bubble was barely a concern. Many said they needed to buy more land to expand their businesses so they can generate more income. And in this wobbly economy, they found safety in stashing their money in farmland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's a C.D. at the bank? Half a percent,'' said Clark Wadle, who attended the auction. ''What's the stock market? Unstable. Whether land prices go up or they go down again, you still have the property.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The winning bidder, Gaylord Jones of Eagle Grove, said that buying farmland was a way to invest on his own terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't buy stocks,'' he said. ''This way, I make my own damn mistakes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst drought in decades this summer seemed a distant memory here as about two dozen farmers escaped the cold and rain for the coffee-and-cookie-infused air inside the lodge where the auction was held.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, the drought has benefited farmers seeking land. Brent Kuehnast, who bought 190 acres this summer to add to the roughly 1,200 his family owns, said the drought helped him negotiate a below-market price on the property near his home in Humboldt, Iowa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the drought also caused some anxiety over his purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent afternoon, as his pickup truck bobbed like a vessel in choppy water over the dirt of his new plot, Mr. Kuehnast, 44, smiled when asked how often he inspected his new land, which he will start farming next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All the time,'' he said. ''I like to find out where it needs to be improved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No state has benefited more from the farmland boom than Iowa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to an agriculture land survey by Iowa State University, prices have risen 32 percent since 2010. Statewide, farmland prices averaged $6,700 an acre, the highest ever, even after adjusting for inflation. Four years ago, prices averaged $3,900 an acre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the strong demand for farmland, banking regulators fear that farmers could take on more debt to make purchases, a repeat of the 1970s and early 1980s, when overleveraged farmers used their farms as collateral to buy up more land. The resulting debt led to a slew of bankruptcies and plummeting land values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those days are fresh in the mind of John Kintzle, 68, who lives near Cedar Rapids and attended the auction here in north-central Iowa just to observe. Back then, he said, prices dropped from $3,000 an acre to $1,000 an acre in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm a little gun-shy,'' he said, though he added that he was open to purchasing. ''My wife thinks I'm nuts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say that so far there are few signs of a repeat of those days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agriculture Department data show that net farm income is expected to increase to $122 billion this year from $117 billion in 2011, a 4 percent increase even with the effects of the drought. That's the highest income level since 1973 on an inflation-adjusted basis. Economists say farmland values are getting a boost from corn and soybean prices, which had reached records highs because of the drought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farmers are carrying less debt than they were 30 years ago, and low interest rates are also a factor because they make it less costly for farmers to borrow. The federal crop insurance program also plays a role in keeping farmland prices high, by covering a majority of losses in revenue or crop yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators, however, say that despite the continued growth in farmland prices there are reasons to be cautious. Some lenders have reported that a number of farmers are taking out loans based on the current value of their land to take advantage of the farmland boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials and some real estate brokers said these buyers could be in trouble if interest rates rose and crop prices fell. This could cause farmland values to drop by a third to a half, putting farmers at risk of default. Another risk is that if the drought stretches into multiple years, it could interrupt the boom in farmland prices, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was not something to worry about, said Brian Wagner, who stopped his bidding at the auction because he thought values would eventually drop, allowing him to buy a better piece of land at a lower price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That would be like me asking you, 'When you get in your car or on the bus, do you think about getting into an accident?' '' he said. ''Accidents happen randomly. Droughts come and droughts go. They don't come very often.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a drop in prices since the housing market crash and historically low mortgage rates, many families still can't afford to buy a home in many major cities, a new analysis finds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite lower prices, a median-income household can afford a median-priced home in just 14 of the country's 25 largest metropolitan areas due to rising expenses and stagnant wages, research from Interest.com finds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home affordability[http://www.interest.com/mortgage/news/homes-are-truly-affordable-in-only-about-half-of-major-cities.] study finds that Detroit, Atlanta and Minneapolis are the most affordable markets, and San Diego, New York and San Francisco are the least affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even after years of declining home prices and record-low mortgage rates, median-income households are unable to afford a median-priced home in nearly half of the metropolitan areas that we looked at," explained Mike Sante, the site's managing editor, in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To determine their rankings, Interest.com gathered the median home prices in the 25 largest metropolitan areas in the United States and calculated how much financing would be required for a buyer with a 20 percent down payment. The site crunched data from the National Association of Realtors, the Census Bureau and other sources, including data on insurance costs and taxes, to arrive at its findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest.com gave each market a letter-grade for overall affordability, as well as a "paycheck power" rating, which indicates the percentage by which the median income exceeds, or falls short of, the income necessary to buy a median-priced home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta scored an "A" on affordability and a paycheck power rating of 40 percent, which means that the median income in the city exceeds that needed to buy a median-priced home there by 40 percent. The city has relatively low home prices -- the median sale price of $103,200 is well below the average of nearly $230,000 for the 25 largest cities - and slightly higher income. (Detroit's rating was even higher, but the city represents a special situation, Interest.com notes, because the low home prices reflect a large number of abandoned properties).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The least affordable city was San Francisco, where the median income falls 33 percent short of the income needed to buy a median-priced home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most-affordable and least-affordable markets and their paycheck power ratings are:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Detroit (+45.32 percent)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Atlanta (+40 percent)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Minneapolis (+32.2 percent)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Phoenix (+23.67 percent)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. St. Louis (+23.49 percent)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Least Affordable Metropolitan Areas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">21. Los Angeles (-12.52 percent)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">22. Miami (-12.59 percent)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">23. San Diego (-25.9 percent)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">24. New York (-29.71 percent)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">25. San Francisco (-32.76 percent)</p>

</div><div class="author">By LISA PREVOST </div><div>713 words</div><div>21 October 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JUST as beleaguered borrowers are beginning to feel some relief from a $25 billion deal requiring the nation's biggest banks to forgive more mortgage debt, another financial threat looms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it stands now, any mortgage debt forgiven by a lender in a short sale, loan modification or foreclosure is exempt from federal taxation. Come Jan. 1, that exemption expires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers will have to count mortgage relief from lenders as income on their federal tax returns. That means, for example, a borrower would have to pay taxes on a $100,000 reduction in principal owed on a loan, or a $20,000 write-off in the amount owed after a short sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An extension of the tax exemption -- established under the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 -- is a strong possibility. But given that Congress will have to grapple with serious fiscal issues after the November elections, there is no guarantee the exemption will emerge from those negotiations intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm optimistic in the sense that everyone agrees on the merits of the issue and that it's good for the market,'' said Jamie Gregory, the deputy chief lobbyist for the National Association of Realtors, which is pushing for the exemption's renewal. ''My only caution is the process.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goldie Sommer, a real estate lawyer in Fairfield, N.J., who specializes in short sales, says she, too, is hopeful that an extension will come through, but she is taking no chances. Her office staff is doing all it can to make it easier for lenders to sign off on short sales. That means submitting packages only when they include a signed contract and a good-faith deposit from the buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that short sales handled by her office take, on average, two to three months to complete, deals being negotiated now are already bumping up against the Dec. 31 exemption cutoff. ''We're trying to push the short sales now as fast as we can,'' Ms. Sommer said, ''or our clients will get stuck with a big fat tax bill.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Debt Relief Act exemption applies only to canceled mortgage debt used to buy, build or improve a primary residence, not a second home. The maximum exemption is $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, the estimated tax savings to borrowers from the exemption was at least $1 billion, according to calculations by the Realtors association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reinstating the tax would undercut the effect of the settlement reached earlier this year in the federal government's investigation into banks' epic mishandling of foreclosure documents. Under the terms of the settlement, five of the biggest mortgage lenders must put some $17 billion toward debt relief that enables borrowers to stay in their homes. Smaller portions are reserved for short sales and refinancing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers in New York and New Jersey would feel considerable pain if the tax exemption expired, because both states have a backlog of foreclosures, said Michael Litzner, the owner/broker of Century 21 American Homes, which has offices on Long Island. The foreclosure process in these states is longer than in any other, according to RealtyTrac. New York has the longest timeline -- 1,072 days as of the third quarter, compared with the national average of 382 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a tremendous shadow inventory that's still looming out there that needs to be mitigated,'' Mr. Litzner said. Still, borrowers ought not rush into a short sale decision solely because of the tax issue, said Jason Milligan, the owner of Milligan Realty, in Norwalk, Conn. They should look into whether it applies to their situation, and consider their options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For example,'' he said, ''if you can get another year living in the house for free, then it's not going to matter so much. And if you're going bankrupt, you might as well keep shelter over your head as long as you can until they throw you out on the street.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Litzner says ending the exemption would be a ''huge blow'' to the economy. Without it, he predicted, ''people will walk away from properties; you take it off the table and people lose the incentive to settle.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has been a relative bright spot in the nation’s economy this year, and Friday’s data did not point to a reversal in that trend. The reading for August was revised slightly higher to show resales at a rate of 4.83 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a home resale rose 11.3 percent from a year earlier, to $183,900. The rise in prices appears to be a result of tight inventories and a downward trend in sales made under distressed conditions like foreclosures[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To support the economy, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> began a program last month to buy housing-related debt, an action that has driven mortgage rates to record lows. Fed policy makers meet next week, but are unlikely to take new steps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy has shown signs of faster growth recently, with the jobless rate falling and retail sales picking up. Threats to that momentum remain, however. The United States government is on track to tighten fiscal policy in January, while Europe’s debt crisis[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/european_sovereign_debt_crisis/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] also looms heavily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight inventories have helped support home prices in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation’s stock of existing homes for sale fell 3.3 percent last month, to 2.32 million units. At the current rate of sales, inventories would be exhausted in 5.9 months, the lowest rate since March 2006, the Realtor’s association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> estimated growth in the housing sector would most likely add about a quarter of a percentage point to economic growth this year and half a point in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the economic lift comes from the building of new homes, although existing-home sales also help growth as people go out to buy furniture and real estate agents reap more in commissions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) — Builders started construction on homes in September at the fastest rate since July 2008 and made plans to build even more homes in the coming months. The gains show the housing recovery is strengthening and could help the economy grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Wednesday that home construction rose 15 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 872,000. Single-family construction rose 11 percent to the fastest rate in four years. Apartment building increased 25.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for building permits, a sign of future construction, jumped nearly 12 percent to an annual rate of 894,000, also the highest since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If there was any doubt that the housing market was undergoing a recovery, even a modest one in the face of the terrible 2008 decline, those doubts should be erased by now,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction rate has increased by more than 38 percent over the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts are now 82.5 percent above the recession low rate of 478,000 hit in April 2009. That is still well short of the 1.5 million that economists consider healthy and far below the more than two million built in 2007 — the peak of the housing boom. But the steady upward trend suggests builders believe the housing rebound is durable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a good report,” said Patrick Newport, United States economist at HIS Global Insight. “It is telling us that the housing market is improving and there is no reason to think that this will not continue going forward.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Record-low mortgage rates, stable price increases and a limited supply of previously occupied homes have made newly built homes more attractive to buyers. Builder confidence is at a six-year high, according to a survey released Tuesday by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>. And the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>’s aggressive policies should keep long-term interest rates low, making home-buying affordable for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction activity rose in three of the nation’s four regions. The biggest increases came in the West and South. Housing starts increased by nearly 20 percent in both regions. Construction of new homes and apartments rose 6.7 percent in the Midwest. Housing starts fell 5.1 percent in the Northeast.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shimmering limestone tower at 15 Central Park West, where apartments routinely trade for upward of $20 million, has become symbolic of the most luxurious upper reaches of New York's real estate market. Its architect, Robert A. M. Stern, is the dean of the Yale School of Architecture. The views stretch out over the expanse of Central Park. And earlier this year, a single penthouse sold for $88 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet despite its sublime finishes, refined pedigree and nosebleed prices, the residential portion of that Manhattan building is officially valued by the city, for tax purposes, at only $332 per square foot. In reality, the average price per square foot for apartments sold there over the past 18 months has been $7,813, according to the Miller Samuel appraisal firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of disparity is true for many of the stratospherically expensive apartments in the city. As a result, their owners pay far less in property taxes, relative to the value of the apartments, than most New York apartment owners pay. So despite a boom in the upper echelons of the real estate market -- 125 apartments have sold for at least $20 million in the last five years, and developers are churning out more every year -- the city is unable to truly cash in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effect ripples down from there. ''If a certain kind of property is systematically undervalued, another kind of property has to pick up the slack,'' said Andrew Hayashi, a property tax expert at the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a study of 2010 nationwide property tax rates, the average homeowner paid a median of 1.14 percent of home value that year, according to the Tax Foundation, a research group. In Manhattan, that figure was 0.78 percent. For the $88 million apartment at 15 Central Park West, 0.78 percent would be $686,000. But this year, the property taxes due on that penthouse were $59,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relatively low tax bill was mainly due to its valuation, but the owners of that penthouse -- the financier Sanford I. Weill sold it to a trust controlled by Ekaterina Rybolovleva, the daughter of a Russian billionaire -- were also helped by a program called 421a, which gives developers big tax breaks for a certain number of years that they can pass along to condo buyers, in exchange for which the developers build or help finance affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even without the 421a abatement, the bill for the penthouse would have been only $145,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These comparatively meager official values are the result of a state law dating from decades ago that requires the city to calculate the value of condominiums and co-ops by using rental buildings as comparable properties, instead of apartment sales. At the top of the market, populated by $20 million, $30 million, $40 million, even $88 million apartments, real estate experts say that truly comparable rental buildings essentially do not exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The highest-value ones are going to tend to be the hardest to line up,'' said George Sweeting, deputy director of the city's Independent Budget Office. Their resulting effective tax rates, he continued, ''will be extremely low, even by the standards of the city.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Independent Budget Office, the overall city valuation for condos and co-ops is only about 20 percent of what it would be were the city allowed to use comparable sales. That is a striking discount, but one that shrivels in comparison with the market's upper echelons, which means the percentage of the sales value that those apartments pay in taxes shrivels right along with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An apartment at the Plaza Hotel that sold for $48 million last year is valued by the city at $1.7 million, or 3.5 percent of its sale price. A condo at 80 Columbus Circle that sold for $30.55 million last summer is valued at $2 million, or 6.5 percent. And the $88 million apartment is valued at $2.97 million, just 3.4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state law mandating the use of rental data has been on the books since the 1980s, when the market in the city was a very different place. Manhattan had more rent regulation, many fewer condos and lots of co-op conversions. A 2006 city report said tying the value of co-ops and condos to rentals was expected to keep an apartment's official value -- and, thus, its property taxes -- from rising too quickly, because rent regulation kept rental values relatively stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, to find a condo's or co-op's comparable rental cousin, the Finance Department looks at factors like age, location and size. Older buildings, even the grandest, often have a greater value discrepancy than new condos because older rentals are more likely to have at least some rent-stabilized units; this means that the taxes on those properties are generally lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for any truly lavish building, finding a comparable rental is a challenge. One of the rental buildings used to find the value of 15 Central Park West, for example, is 145 West 67th Street -- a very tall, but otherwise unremarkable, building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We understand that the requirement by state law to ignore sales prices makes an already complex property tax system even more confusing for property owners, which raises questions of equity within the system,'' Owen Stone, a spokesman for the Finance Department, said in an e-mail. ''We are always looking for ways to make things more transparent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property tax experts say that from time to time, some effort is made to rethink the way apartments are valued. But changes can be made only by the State Legislature, and the technical and political pressures tend to overwhelm the cause, which then is quietly put on a shelf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not so easy to go and change one screw,'' said Ana Champeny, a supervising analyst at the Independent Budget Office. ''Potentially, you have to redo the whole system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These property taxes, of course, are not paid in a vacuum. The city does receive a transfer tax every time a property is sold, as well as a mortgage recording tax, though many high-priced homes are bought with cash. And while the property taxes on mansions in the sky may be a relatively low percentage of sales value, they are still substantial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for Extell -- which is developing the luxury market's hottest ticket of the moment, One57, where two apartments are under contract for at least $90 million -- said the project would contribute over 1,000 construction jobs and hundreds of permanent jobs to the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it happens, Extell has also applied for 421a tax abatements for One57.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the property taxes on these luxury apartments were to rise, would it even make a difference in sales to the superrich?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think you'd choke off that market,'' said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said that in some instances, exceptionally high carrying costs had tugged down prices and slowed the pace of sales, even in apartments that cost tens of millions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The logic was that the high end of the market doesn't really care if the monthly charges are high; it's more readily absorbed than on the lower end, and that turned out not to be true,'' Mr. Miller said. ''The conventional wisdom was, 'Ah, the wealthy don't care!' But of course they do.''</p>
<p>The city valued apartments at 15 Central Park West at $332 per  square foot; on average they have sold for $7,813 a square foot.; New York has been unable to cash in on the high end of the real estate market, like a $48 million apartment at the Plaza Hotel.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">American Civil Liberties Union</span> is accusing <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> of fueling the production of risky, expensive loans that targeted African-American borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the lawsuit, expected to be filed on Monday, the A.C.L.U. claims that <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> is culpable for predatory loans made through the <span class="companylink">New Century Financial Corporation</span> because the investment bank lent billions of dollars to New Century, a now-defunct subprime lender, and pressured it to make troublesome loans to African-American borrowers who could not afford them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> packaged the loans made by New Century and sold them to pension funds and other large investors. But, the lawsuit claims, the bank went beyond the traditional role of an investment bank by requiring that the mortgage company churn out the wildly profitable loans that came with ''dangerous'' characteristics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the lawsuit says, many of the loans ultimately sold to investors were ''stated income'' loans, in which borrowers could estimate their incomes without having to provide supporting documentation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The action against <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> follows a series of lawsuits brought by investors and federal and state officials against some of the nation's largest banks. The A.C.L.U. suit, which is to be filed in federal court in New York and will seek class-action certification, claims that <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> violated the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rubbie McCoy, one of the five named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, took out a loan from New Century in 2006 with an adjustable rate starting at 12.14 percent, which could not fall below 10.75 percent. It came with ''excessive fees and costs,'' the suit said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McCoy, a single mother, said she could not afford the payments, but the broker told her to ''fudge'' her income, the suit says. Now, she is fighting to save the Detroit home that she shares with her four children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Having a house was a way to keep my kids grounded,'' Ms. McCoy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> declined to comment on Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, in an action against another bank, federal prosecutors in New York sued <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, the country's largest mortgage lender, saying it made ''reckless'' loans for more than a decade that soured, and subsequently left them to the government's insurance program to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its first salvo earlier this month, the federal mortgage task force formed by the Justice Department sued <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns &amp; Company</span>, currently a unit of <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, accusing the company of widespread misconduct during the heady days of the housing boom in the packaging and sale of mortgage securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> came under fire from the Massachusetts attorney general in 2010 for its packaging of New Century mortgage loans. In June 2010, the bank agreed to pay $102 million to close an investigation by the attorney general, Martha Coakley, into questionable lending practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Coakley said the bank ignored warning signs about the quality of New Century's loans and tried to court the lender's business by lowering its loan standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The A.C.L.U.'s complaint says, ''<span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> actively encouraged lending tactics that increased the levels of risk associated with individual loans.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subprime loans cited in the suit were made from 2004 to 2007. New Century, one of the country's most prolific subprime lenders, went bankrupt in March 2007. Based on lending data from 2005 through 2007, the suit says, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determined that New Century was responsible for the greatest share of loans in foreclosure in the 10 metropolitan areas blighted by the highest foreclosure rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former employee who testified in a separate civil suit against <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> said that bank officials knowingly bought loans in which borrowers' debt levels were more than 50 percent of their total income, according to the A.C.L.U. lawsuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank, according to one former employee, typically did not require New Century to conduct a second appraisal of homes, fearing that the second look would result in a lower assessment and prevent the loans from being securitized, the suit says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While other investment banks purchased New Century's loans, the lawsuit claims that <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> ''purchased a greater proportion of New Century's loans than any other institution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loans generated by New Century disproportionately targeted African-American borrowers, the lawsuit claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">African-Americans living in the Detroit area were 70 percent more likely to wind up with a subprime loan than were white borrowers with similar financial characteristics, according to an analysis, contained in the lawsuit, of New Century loans made between 2004 and 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department has accused two major banks of discriminating against black and Hispanic customers. A settlement in one case was announced in July, when <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> agreed to pay $175 million to settle claims that the bank steered roughly 34,000 minority customers into subprime mortgages, even though they could have qualified for mortgage with lower fees and less risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest settlement of a residential fair-lending violation came last December, when <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> agreed to pay the Justice Department $335 million to put to rest claims that its Countrywide unit discriminated against minority borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Ms. McCoy, the $79,200 loan that allowed her to buy a home in 2006 quickly turned into an albatross, she said. She struggled to pay the monthly amount, which at the time consumed more than half of her monthly income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help her qualify for the loan, Ms. McCoy said, the broker inflated her income, in part, by ratcheting up the money she received for child support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last May, Ms. McCoy was unable to afford her monthly mortgage payments. She said she had little hope of saving her home. ''I am just waiting for them to kick me out,'' she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A DOZEN years ago, I lived through the hype machine of the energy trading industry in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enron and other firms were transforming themselves into investment banks for traders of natural gas and electricity. They sometimes booked profits today on revenues not expected for another decade. Companies showed off their state-of-the-art trading floors. One hired Ray Charles to sing at a dinner for analysts. We all know how that story ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been other bubbles, of course — particularly in the technology sector — but these days, I’m having flashbacks to my Houston days when I visit Miami[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/south-florida/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and learn more about its high-end real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for expensive waterfront properties, much of it coming from South Americans and other foreigners looking to park their cash, has the industry punch-drunk with enthusiasm. Miami agents are putting off vacations (lest they miss a big sale), and some are regularly flying to South America on sales missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s a roller coaster that has a lot of people shaking their heads in disbelief. After all, as recently as two years ago, Miami was the poster child for distressed real estate. “Now it is redefining itself through luxury real estate,” said Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel, an appraiser that produces a quarterly report on Miami for Douglas Elliman Florida[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/florida/index.html?inline=nyt-geo].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is like it got rebranded,” he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But is it a bubble? Or, to frame the question more specifically, just how sustainable — and healthy — is this recent boomlet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that Miami, more than any big city in the country, has two very different real estate realities somehow coexisting, at least for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the one hand, there are the nondistressed properties along the water, where sales activity is climbing, prices are on the rise, and some record sales this year have captured the industry’s imagination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A penthouse on South Beach sold to an Italian for $25 million. A single-family home in Indian Creek sold to a Russian for $47 million. And the telecom mogul Peter Loftin listed the former Gianni Versace mansion on Ocean Drive (where Mr. Versace was murdered) for $125 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign purchases — which analysts estimate make up a third of all sales in Miami and very likely more than half of sales over $1 million — are driving much of the sales activity. New Yorkers have also played a big role, brokers say. And cash is king: nearly 73 percent of nondistressed condo sales, and 76 percent of distressed condo sales, were all-cash in the third quarter of this year, Miller Samuel said in its most recent Miami report, released in the last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in New York, real estate agents gripe about the scarcity of luxury properties to sink their clients’ millions into. “There are not a lot of amazing $10 million or $20 million homes out there that don’t need a whole lot of renovations or have land on the waterfront,” said Vanessa Grout, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman Florida. “Brokers are going nuts because their clients are seeking something really special.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture is starkly different in the distressed market, where sales dipped by 21.5 percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 27.3 percent for nondistressed real estate. Properties going through foreclosure[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and short sales still make up 41 percent of the overall market in the 18 Miami coastal communities that Miller Samuel tracks. The average third-quarter sales price of nondistressed properties ($528,705) was more than three times that of distressed properties ($161,777).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices of distressed real estate in Miami have been rising, perhaps in part because of the enthusiasm generated by the big sales near the beach. But analysts caution against putting too much faith in the higher prices. The market is still suffering the effects of the robo-signing scandal of late 2010 — in which lenders were processing foreclosure documents without verifying their accuracy — and the courts are clogged with cases that could further depress prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 56,911 foreclosure cases pending in the Miami-Dade County Court at the end of August, the court said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That number was down 11 percent from the previous August, but filings are on the rise again. They nearly doubled from January to August compared to the same eight months of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are waiting for the other shoe to drop as these new foreclosures come online and potentially create another drag on the market going forward,” said Daren Blomquist, vice president of RealtyTrac, which monitors foreclosures nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a while the foreclosure picture was improving. Then about 10 months ago the outlook darkened. Miami-Dade ranked 10th in the country in foreclosure activity in August among the 212 metropolitan areas studied by RealtyTrac, up from 26th in August 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blomquist estimates that distressed properties will weigh down the Miami market for at least the next year and a half. It takes an average of 858 days to complete a foreclosure in Florida, more than twice the national average. Only New Jersey[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newjersey/?inline=nyt-geo] and New York — at 1,072 days — take longer, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high concentration of distressed cases, coupled with so many all-cash transactions, has dissuaded most lenders from getting back into the Miami market, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Homestead, a working-class Miami suburb hit hard by the housing downturn, Larry Roth, a real estate agent, says all-cash buyers are scooping up properties almost the same day they hit the market. Most are out-of-town investors, many from out of the country, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It has been challenging for end users to purchase properties as they have to compete with investors,” said Mr. Roth, who works for Keyes Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has no doubt that a flood of new foreclosures, after they exit the courts, will eventually push prices down again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am sure it will,” he said. “And some people out there hope it does, the investors that are just waiting to pick these properties up.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit remains tough — but not impossible — to come by for first-time buyers, Mr. Roth said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet across Miami, Mr. Miller doesn’t see credit easing much, something that needs to happen for the market to return to a more normal, sustainable state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What I get concerned about — not now but a few years down the road — is, does Miami have all its eggs in one basket?” Mr. Miller said. “Is it at the mercy of the foreign buyer, the all-cash buyer?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the dollar changes direction and foreign buyers slow their participation, “what carries the torch are more traditional transactions, with people getting a mortgage,” he said. “Right now that isn’t happening.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the hype goes on.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Justin Olson put his Southwestern-style ranch house outside Phoenix on the market, he got what he was expecting: an immediate batch of offers, virtually all above his asking price, which was set intentionally low, at $197,500, to attract interest. He chose an offer of $210,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then came an unpleasant surprise. An appraiser for the buyer’s bank said the house was worth only $195,000. That limited the amount that the bank would lend, forcing the buyer to come up with more cash or negotiate a lower price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There was just no way I was selling that house for less than $200,000,” Mr. Olson said. His broker, Brett Barry of Homesmart, advised him that there was little chance of changing the appraiser’s mind. Mr. Olson said, “The part that blows me away — the appraisal can be such an arbitrary, personal decision and there is no appeals process.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to his indignation, a similar house two doors away was appraised at and sold for $225,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisals are generally ordered by banks so they can verify the value of collateral before granting a mortgage. Before the housing crash, when home values seemed only to rise, appraisals were almost an afterthought. But now, with banks far more cautious about lending, a low appraisal can torpedo a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is so widespread that this week the National Association of Realtors[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_association_of_realtors/index.html?inline=nyt-org] blamed faulty appraisals for holding back the housing recovery, saying its members had reported that more than a third of all deals were canceled, delayed or renegotiated to a lower price because of a low appraisal. Several real estate agents said they were starting to include appraisal contingencies in their contracts, spelling out how much a buyer would be willing to pay in cash if the appraisal fell short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisers use previous sales of comparable houses to help value a home. If prices are just starting to climb, and sales take two or three months to close, there can be a lag before the change in prices is observed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors report said appraisers were improperly using foreclosures[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and neglected properties as comparable homes, failing to account for market conditions like scarce inventory and bidding wars, and working in areas where they lack local expertise. The report faulted banks for using inexperienced appraisers, and for creating unrealistic requirements, like six comparable sales instead of three, at a time of few sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s holding sellers off the market,” said Jed Smith, the managing director of quantitative research for the Realtors group. “Sales volume could probably be an additional 10 to 15 percent higher if we had normal lending practices and if we had normal appraisal practices.” That in turn, he said, would create more jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisers and real estate brokers agreed that a ban, imposed since the housing crash, on loan originators’ handpicking appraisers had led to the use of appraisal management companies that take a healthy cut of the consumer’s fee and hire inexperienced, low-cost appraisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But appraisers took issue with the complaints and pointed out that unlike real estate agents, they have no bias or incentive to help complete a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Appraisers don’t set the market, they reflect what’s happening in the market,” said Ken Chitester, a spokesman for the Appraisal Institute, a professional association. “So don’t shoot the messenger. Blaming the appraiser for a bad housing market is like blaming the weatherman because you don’t like the weather.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Olson and his buyer compromised on a price of $205,000, less than initially offered and therefore, some might say, less than the house was worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But any transaction involving a mortgage is limited by the appraisal — an assessment that is part science and part art and is based on a variety of factors like location and square footage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Mr. Olson’s house was in good condition, the house nearby that sold for more had at least $30,000 worth of upgrades, said Craig Young, the broker who represented the seller. But Mr. Young said appraisals could still be unpredictable, pointing out that a home across the street sold for even more, $239,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some appraisers said agents misunderstand the way homes were valued. For example, although bank-owned homes generally sell at a discount, that is not true in every neighborhood, said Dan McKinnon, who runs an appraisal company with his wife in Phoenix. Appraisers, therefore, do not automatically make adjustments if they are using such sales for comparison. Some bank-owned homes are in good condition, and in some neighborhoods bank-owned sales dominate the market, and thus determine prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If that property is in similar condition to your subject, it is direct competition,” Mr. McKinnon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">R. James Girardot, an appraiser in Seattle, said appraisers could protect buyers — particularly those from out of town who might think a home sounds like a great deal because prices are much higher where they live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he recently did an appraisal in a desirable subdivision where the contract price was head and shoulders above other recent sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was told by all the agents I talked to that there’s a real shortage out here, and this house is the sharpest house that has ever come on the market,” Mr. Girardot said. Then he found six other houses in the area for sale, and not one was close in price to the house in question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in some areas the light sales activity can cause legitimate worries. This week Shannon Moore, a real estate agent on Florida’s west coast, said she had written a contract for more than $1 million for a house on a barrier island. There had been no recent sales on the island, but one was set to close soon, meaning that a single price could affect her deal. “Everybody holds their breath until the appraisal comes in,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, agents use appraisals to convince sellers that their expectations are too high and that they should accept a lower offer. But in other cases, sellers know that traditional buyers are competing with cash investors who will pay more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afra Mendes Newell, a Florida agent, said one of her clients recently bid $150,000 on a home that was appraised for $135,000. The deal fell through, but another buyer stepped in with $150,000 cash. The good news, she said, was that the next appraisal in the neighborhood would take that price into account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents can try to head off low valuations by arming the appraiser with relevant comparable sales and information about renovations or upgrades that are not readily visible, like insulation. Buyers who disagree with an appraisal can ask the bank to review it, ask for a second appraisal, pay for their own appraisal, or file a complaint with the state, though agents said the chances of salvaging a sale were slim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisers see some irony in the accusation that, so soon after a housing bubble, they are being accused of holding prices down. They said buyers should not be too eager to make a purchase that is far above recent sales in a neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We can account for small to reasonable increases in values,” Mr. McKinnon said. “We cannot account for $20,000 jumps in a month.”</p>

</div><div class="author">By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF </div><div>1221 words</div><div>10 October 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Realogy</span>, the operator of Century 21 and other real estate businesses, is the Rocky Balboa of corporate America. Left for dead in the financial crisis, <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> has not only survived but is now in a Rocky-like comeback, planning an initial public offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's recent history is also an illustration of how private equity firms - in this case, Leon Black's <span class="companylink">Apollo Global Management</span> - can save, not destroy, companies, making money for themselves in good times and bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apollo bought <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> for some $7 billion in the spring of 2007, contributing about $2 billion of its own money and borrowing more than $6 billion to pay for the deal and to refinance debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private equity may be considered smart money, but this acquisition took place at an extraordinarily bad time. Not only was the deal struck as the housing market was crashing, but Apollo saddled <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> with too much debt. The company was left nearly bankrupt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net revenue plummeted to $4 billion in 2010 from about $6.5 billion in 2006. As revenue declined, the company hemorrhaged cash to pay roughly $600 million a year in interest. By 2009, the company was cash flow negative, kept alive only by additional borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors viewed the company as virtually insolvent - its debt traded at less than 10 cents on the dollar. At the time, Apollo's $2 billion stake seemed to be worthless. I remember having a conversation in 2009 with a hedge fund manager who couldn't believe the company was still in existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Apollo tried some financial wizardry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the private equity firm publicly asserted that it would provide further funds as necessary to keep <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s business alive. Apollo also doubled down on <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> by buying up its debt on the cheap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apollo then engaged in multiple efforts to restructure the company's debt aggressively. It took on hedge funds holding <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s debt, leading a battle against Carl C. Icahn and other hedge fund operators who were opposed to <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s restructuring plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apollo's first restructuring attempt was successfully blocked by Mr. Icahn. Forced to rejigger its refinancing, the private equity firm still succeeded in reducing <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s debt and, more important, in extending the maturity of most of the company's debt out to 2016 and beyond. This bought <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> more time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Apollo also kept its word, buying more than a $1 billion in new <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> debt, providing the company needed support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result was that <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> was kept alive on the operating table, allowing it to further restructure its business. Management savagely cut costs through the downturn. Total expenses are now $4.5 billion a year, compared with almost $6 billion in 2006. The number of employees was reduced by a third and over 350 brokerage offices were closed or consolidated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Realogy</span> is now stable and its bonds are trading at par - a 900 percent return on the debt alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, all is not well with <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>. As the housing market struggles to recover, the company has had to borrow to survive. Last year, <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> lost $190 million in cash from operations and needed to draw the difference in debt financing put in place by Apollo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever willing to use the capital markets to help make a return on <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>, Apollo is now planning the next stage in the company's restructuring, an I.P.O. The current plan is for the company to issue as many as 46 million new shares, raising $1.08 billion. The money will be used to pay down $2.8 billion in <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s debt. Convertible note holders led by John Paulson's hedge fund will also convert $1.9 billion in notes into shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the I.P.O. is successful, the company's debt load will go to $330 million from $672 million, making it cash flow positive and also profitable. And as a plus, <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> has $2.1 billion in tax credits from prior losses that it can use to offset any future profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no guarantee that Apollo can pull this I.P.O. off. For investors, <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> is really a bet on an upturn in housing. In its prospectus, the company says that its earnings will increase as housing sales go up. But if there is no housing recovery, a post-I.P.O. <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> will still have significant debt and historically flat revenues - not the makings of a great investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even if the I.P.O. does not happen, Apollo has accomplished the extraordinary. If not for its efforts, <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> would be bankrupt. The private equity firm had the knowledge and wherewithal to keep working the capital markets and continuously restructure <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s debt to ensure its survival. Apollo also stepped up and was willing to risk even more money to support the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being private also probably provided room for <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> to act quickly and make necessary cuts, something which would have been harder for a public company to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, Apollo had no one to blame but itself for <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s precarious situation, having loaded it up with debt in the first place. Nevertheless, the story of <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> shows how private equity firms can use financial wizardry to save a company, not pillage it. Private equity firms can also lend their excess cash and expertise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s survival jibes with at least one study that found that companies owned by private equity firms default on their debt less often than public companies. The authors attribute the reason to the presence of a sophisticated owner with the wherewithal to help, certainly the case here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This leads to the second remarkable thing about the <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> deal. Apollo is probably in the black on its investment. If the I.P.O. succeeds, Apollo will still own about 48 percent of the company with a stake valued at about $1.6 billion. There are also the big gains on the bonds Apollo bought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the management fee of $15 million a year that <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> has been paying to Apollo and the $40 million that <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> is paying Apollo to terminate that agreement in connection with the public offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combined, this means that Apollo is not making a huge return but has very likely profited on its $2 billion investment. That the equity alone here is worth so much only a few years after <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> almost went bankrupt - and on an investment made at the height of the real estate bubble - is miraculous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Realogy</span>'s Hollywood-like comeback shows how private equity firms can succeed even when they make the wrong call. The firms can use financial engineering to create Rube Goldbergesque financing structures that frankly appear to create their own money. <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> has more than 15 different types of debt instruments alone. The case of <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> shows private equity can be a company's savior during even the worst of times.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HENDERSON, Nev. — Las Vegas might seem the last place a presidential candidate would choose to spend three days of sober, nose-to-the-grindstone debate preparation. But since Sunday, President Obama[http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/candidates/barack-obama?inline=nyt-per] has been encamped 17 miles from the neon excess of the Strip, in a palm-fringed, financially battered lakeside resort that serves as a vivid reminder of the economic distress that still threatens his hopes for re-election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as Lake Las Vegas, the 3,600-acre gated complex — which includes three golf courses, a man-made lake, a casino and two hotels, plus a replica of the Ponte Vecchio in Florence — has the disused air of a paradise lost. Few people here seem to notice Mr. Obama’s presence, but that is partly because there are so few people around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complex has been in and out of bankruptcy multiple times, many of the Spanish-style houses in the residential cul-de-sacs are empty or in foreclosure[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], and two of the three golf courses are abandoned, their putting greens scorched to a dingy brown. A <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> hotel closed in May 2010 because of the gasping economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its dizzying boom and bust, Lake Las Vegas epitomizes the damage done to Nevada, a state hit harder than almost any other by the housing collapse and one that Mitt Romney[http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/primaries/candidates/mitt-romney?inline=nyt-per] is fiercely contesting. Mr. Romney, who was already in Denver ahead of the debate, is sure to fault Mr. Obama, both for his housing policies and the lackluster recovery, when they face off on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics here say that Mr. Obama’s policies, which emphasized limited steps to modify loans rather than a broad bailout of homeowners, did little to cushion people from a crash that saddled tens of thousands with houses worth far less than their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They did some things to help, but my understanding is that only about 3 to 4 percent of the homeowners who were underwater here in Las Vegas were able to take advantage of any programs,” said Stephen P. A. Brown, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, local real estate agents say there are glimmers of hope that the worst is over for Lake Las Vegas. A billionaire hedge fund investor, John Paulson, recently bought 530 acres of land on the north shore of the lake, which he plans to develop for housing. Investors, many of them from overseas, are beginning to buy houses, which can be picked up for a fraction of what they cost at the peak of the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For a while there, people were calling it a ghost town,” said Marcy Farris, a real estate broker in Henderson. “But we’re snapping back a bit.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those seeds of hope amid a landscape of ruin may help explain why Mr. Obama has a decent chance to win Nevada, despite its 12.1 percent unemployment rate, the worst in the United States. The jobless rate has fallen slightly since last year, housing prices have started to rise, and residential construction has slowly picked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the offices of <span class="companylink">Windermere Real Estate</span> on the brick-lined shopping street of Lake Las Vegas, “half the agents want to give Obama another term, and half are for Romney — just like our entire country,” said Robyn Yates, the broker and owner. She added, “I’m a Republican, and I really hope Mitt Romney gets it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Polls show Mr. Obama with a lead of about 5 percentage points in Nevada. He has made eight trips here this year, and his choice of Las Vegas for debate preparation was hardly accidental. His aides say he is keenly aware of the human cost of the foreclosed homes that line the routes of his motorcade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is one of the states that every time he comes back here, he’s reminded he wants to continue to find ways to help the housing market improve,” said the campaign’s press secretary, Jen Psaki. “It is something he is impacted by deeply wherever he goes, whether it is conversations, reports, or reading the Nevada newspapers in the morning.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Psaki said she had not talked to the president about the peculiar woes of Lake Las Vegas. In any event, Mr. Obama has had little chance to check out the desiccated golf courses. He spends most of his time in drills with his aides, consultants, and Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat and former presidential contender who is standing in for Mr. Romney in mock debate sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a brief outing Monday to deliver pizzas to a campaign field office in Henderson, Mr. Obama sounded like a man who had just been released from house arrest. “Basically, they’re keeping me indoors all the time,” the president joked to the 20 volunteers. “It’s a drag. They’re making me do my homework.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House officials declined to say why they chose the resort, beyond Ms. Psaki’s observation that “it’s a place where there’s ample space and nice peace and quiet.” Security concerns likely played a part: Mr. Obama is staying at the Westin Lake Las Vegas, a secluded hotel reached by a single road. He stayed here on his last visit, though in previous trips to Las Vegas, he has stayed at Caesars Palace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama has had a chilly relationship with the gambling industry since 2009 when he warned executives at companies that were receiving federal bailout funds, “You can’t go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/super_bowl/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] on the taxpayer’s dime.” Two of the biggest casino owners, Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn, back Mr. Romney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at Lake Las Vegas, where the singer Celine Dion owns a house, the talk is of a renaissance. Ms. Farris, the broker, has listed a 2,000-square-foot stucco house, which had been in foreclosure for years and was stripped clean by vandals. “It was literally missing everything,”she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, she said, an investor bought the house for $129,900 in cash and fixed it up. It is now on the market for $250,000.</p>

</div><div class="author">By C.J. HUGHES </div><div>1207 words</div><div>3 October 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a residential standpoint, 2012 might be considered the year of the penthouse. Rooftop apartments with stunning views and sky-high price tags have seemed to change hands every few months in New York, smashing sales records in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top floors of Manhattan's office buildings can be just as dazzling, but lately their leasing prospects seem to have come back down to earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In premier Midtown buildings, more than a half-dozen penthouses are now available, which is more than in recent memory, according to brokers, landlords and industry analysts. Many of them have been empty for more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those vacancies can in part be explained by a sluggish Midtown leasing market, whose vacancy rate has been stuck around 11 percent, they say. But penthouses, which often have cavernous rooms and quirky layouts, can present their own hurdles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because they are usually the priciest of a building's units, cost can be a deterrent. Current average asking rents are $158 a square foot, according to CBRE, the commercial brokerage, versus $113 for lower floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while lower floors may have comparable views, penthouses can boast singular perks, like the duplex that crowns 623 Fifth Avenue, at East 50th Street, which is flanked by wide planter-lined terraces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can provide a place where tenants can sit outside and enjoy views of New York that are second to none,'' said David Nevins, senior vice president of leasing for Cohen Brothers Realty Corporation, the building's owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent tour of the space, Mr. Nevins pointed out the Chrysler Building, Bank of America Tower and 30 Rockefeller Plaza, as well as Rockefeller Center's skating rink. He said the 21,000-square-foot space previously was occupied by the investment bank <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> and used mostly for meetings and parties. The space takes up the entire 35th and 36th floors, has wood paneling and wall-to-wall carpeting, and a large kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a stronger market, the penthouse, which has been available since March, could probably fetch annual rents of $150 a foot, but will likely end up leasing for between $100 and $125 a foot, he said. ''It's pretty, we know that, but we also understand the realities of the market,'' Mr. Nevins added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large floor plates for these kinds of spaces aren't that unusual. The penthouse duplex on the market at 499 Park Avenue, at East 59th Street, owned by Hines, totals 18,200 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more common among the current batch is the penthouse at 535 Madison Avenue, at East 54th Street, a 1984 building owned by the Park Tower Group. The space, which is perched on the 37th floor, measures 9,500 square feet space, has been available since early 2012 and is asking $125 a foot, according to Brian Gell, the CBRE broker who is marketing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the triangular space lacks outdoor space like a traditional penthouse, it does offer ceiling heights of 26 feet, which easily beats most of its competitors, Mr. Gell said. Reached by a private elevator from the 36th floor, the office is also secure, which the financial tenant that probably ends up there will like, he added. ''All penthouses are not created equally,'' Mr. Gell said. ''Some are truly very special spaces, and some are just the top floor of a building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But having to transfer elevators to get to work can be a nuisance, says Andrew Levin, a senior vice president of leasing for <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span>, the developer, whose two available Midtown penthouses trumpet their direct elevator access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, six passenger elevators travel from the lobby to the 47th floor at 599 Lexington Avenue, at East 53rd Street, an 8,600-square-foot space offering views of a glittering East River. <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span> is asking $110 a foot in rent for the office, which has been on the market for a year. Its size may be a factor. Most office deals are for 5,000 square feet or less, said Mr. Levin, who may ultimately divide the space in half to make it easier to lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, several offices could be carved out of 30th-floor space atop 510 Madison Avenue, an 11,500-square-foot spread with Central Park views, Mr. Levin said. Columnless, with 14-foot ceilings, it's in a new building whose basement fitness center features a skylight-topped two-lane pool. <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span>, which bought the building in 2010 before completing its construction, is asking $145 a foot, though there have been no takers in a year and a half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That delay may not be surprising. ''Penthouses aren't one size fits all,'' Mr. Levin said. ''They're one size fits one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that the kinds of tenants most likely to fill these lofty perches would be in finance, especially managers of family trusts or hedge funds looking to make a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower-elevation spaces are vacant, too, like the duplex penthouse at 681 Fifth Avenue, which is owned by Metropole Realty Advisors and encompasses the 17th and 18th floors of a recently renovated 1912 building by McKim, Mead &amp; White.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its 7,600 square feet, which include internal stairs, 30-foot ceilings and two terraces, have been available since early 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps in a nod to how difficult it can be to price penthouses accurately, brokers for this space won't pinpoint an asking rent, saying only that they expect it to go for at least $100 a foot. ''We want people to come and see it,'' said Mark Mandell of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, who is marketing it. ''I know that sounds a little out of the ordinary, but it's a strategy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all commercial penthouses are dark. Those atop the city's most prestigious office buildings are leased, especially in and around Midtown's Plaza District. Examples include the GM Building, at 767 Fifth Avenue; and Carnegie Hall Tower, at 152 West 57th Street, which are leased, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while some commercial penthouses have struggled, their residential counterparts have soared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 6,700-square-foot penthouse at 15 Central Park West, was listed last November and sold three months later for $88 million, a record. The duplex penthouse at One57, a new condo at 151 West 57th Street, went into contract soon after for more than $90 million, said Extell Development Company, its developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the competition for tenants for Midtown penthouses is now stiff, it could soon get fiercer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planned arrivals include 250 West 55th Street, a new high-rise at Eighth Avenue from <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span>, whose 38th floor will have 14-foot ceilings. And the International Gem Tower, which Extell is building at 50 West 47th Street, will offer a 34th-floor perch when it opens next summer. Also expected to vie for the handful of tenants that could take a penthouse is a downtown building, the 72-story Four World Trade Center, which is set to be completed in 2013.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HENDERSON, Nev. -- Las Vegas might seem the last place a presidential candidate would choose to spend three days of sober, nose-to-the-grindstone debate preparation. But since Sunday, President Obama has been encamped 17 miles from the neon excess of the Strip, in a palm-fringed, financially battered lakeside resort that serves as a vivid reminder of the economic distress that still threatens his hopes for re-election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as Lake Las Vegas, the 3,600-acre gated complex -- which includes three golf courses, a man-made lake, a casino and two hotels, plus a replica of the Ponte Vecchio in Florence -- has the disused air of a paradise lost. Few people here seem to notice Mr. Obama's presence, but that is partly because there are so few people around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complex has been in and out of bankruptcy multiple times, many of the Spanish-style houses in the residential cul-de-sacs are empty or in foreclosure, and two of the three golf courses are abandoned, their putting greens scorched to a dingy brown. A <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> hotel closed in May 2010 because of the gasping economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its dizzying boom and bust, Lake Las Vegas epitomizes the damage done to Nevada, a state hit harder than almost any other by the housing collapse and one that Mitt Romney is fiercely contesting. Mr. Romney, who was already in Denver ahead of the debate, is sure to fault Mr. Obama, both for his housing policies and the lackluster recovery, when they face off on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics here say that Mr. Obama's policies, which emphasized limited steps to modify loans rather than a broad bailout of homeowners, did little to cushion people from a crash that saddled tens of thousands with houses worth far less than their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They did some things to help, but my understanding is that only about 3 to 4 percent of the homeowners who were underwater here in Las Vegas were able to take advantage of any programs,'' said Stephen P. A. Brown, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, local real estate agents say there are glimmers of hope that the worst is over for Lake Las Vegas. A billionaire hedge fund investor, John Paulson, recently bought 530 acres of land on the north shore of the lake, which he plans to develop for housing. Investors, many of them from overseas, are beginning to buy houses, which can be picked up for a fraction of what they cost at the peak of the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For a while there, people were calling it a ghost town,'' said Marcy Farris, a real estate broker in Henderson. ''But we're snapping back a bit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those seeds of hope amid a landscape of ruin may help explain why Mr. Obama has a decent chance to win Nevada, despite its 12.1 percent unemployment rate, the worst in the United States. The jobless rate has fallen slightly since last year, housing prices have started to rise, and residential construction has slowly picked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the offices of <span class="companylink">Windermere Real Estate</span> on the brick-lined shopping street of Lake Las Vegas, ''half the agents want to give Obama another term, and half are for Romney -- just like our entire country,'' said Robyn Yates, the broker and owner. She added, ''I'm a Republican, and I really hope Mitt Romney gets it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Polls show Mr. Obama with a lead of about 5 percentage points in Nevada. He has made eight trips here this year, and his choice of Las Vegas for debate preparation was hardly accidental. His aides say he is keenly aware of the human cost of the foreclosed homes that line the routes of his motorcade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is one of the states that every time he comes back here, he's reminded he wants to continue find ways to help the housing market improve,'' said the campaign's press secretary, Jen Psaki. ''It is something he is impacted by deeply wherever he goes, whether it is conversations, reports, or reading the Nevada newspapers in the morning.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Psaki said she had not talked to the president about the peculiar woes of Lake Las Vegas. In any event, Mr. Obama has had little chance to check out the desiccated golf courses. He spends most of his time in drills with his aides, consultants, and Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat and former presidential contender who is standing in for Mr. Romney in mock debate sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a brief outing Monday to deliver pizzas to a campaign field office in Henderson, Mr. Obama sounded like a man who had just been released from house arrest. ''Basically, they're keeping me indoors all the time,'' the president joked to the 20 volunteers. ''It's a drag. They're making me do my homework.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House officials declined to say why they chose the resort, beyond Ms. Psaki's observation that ''it's a place where there's ample space and nice peace and quiet.'' Security concerns likely played a part: Mr. Obama is staying at the Westin Lake Las Vegas, a secluded hotel reached by a single road. He stayed here on his last visit, though in previous trips to Las Vegas, he has stayed at Caesars Palace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama has had a chilly relationship with the gambling industry since 2009 when he warned executives at companies that were receiving federal bailout funds, ''You can't go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayer's dime.'' Two of the biggest casino owners, Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn, back Mr. Romney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at Lake Las Vegas, where the singer Celine Dion owns a house, the talk is of a renaissance. Ms. Farris, the broker, has listed a 2,000-square-foot stucco house, which had been in foreclosure for years and was stripped clean by vandals. ''It was literally missing everything,''she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, she said, an investor bought the house for $129,900 in cash and fixed it up. It is now on the market for $250,000.</p>

</div><div class="author">By MICHELLE HIGGINS   </div><div>736 words</div><div>2 October 2012</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo] apartment sales rose in the third quarter of 2012 to the highest level since the financial crisis began, despite low inventory, as demand and consumer confidence strengthened, according to reports that will be released by New York City[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo]’s major brokerage firms on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were essentially flat, with some reports showing slight increases and others showing no change or a slight decrease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the number of Manhattan apartment sales in the third quarter rose to 2,790, up 12 percent from a year ago and the highest quarterly total since the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> in 2008, according to reports by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. <span class="companylink">The Corcoran Group</span> reported a 17 percent jump in sales to 3,821 for the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s all about consumer confidence coming back,” said Diane M. Ramirez, president of Halstead Property. “New York has so shown its true grit,” as a place that can sustain “almost whatever comes at it,” she added, “so where else to put your money?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One agency’s report, however, showed sales were down. Prudential Douglas Elliman reported sales volume dropped 5 percent from a year ago. Still, the report showed that the summer months had more momentum, with the number of homes going into contract up 4.9 percent compared with last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the volume of sales picked up, inventory hit a seven and a half year low with 5,847 available listings in the third quarter, down 24.3 percent from the same period a year ago, according to the Elliman report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low equity is keeping sellers from listing, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and the author of Prudential Douglas Elliman’s report. “Those sellers can’t become buyers because of tight credit,” Mr. Miller said. The approaching election and “concern about the direction of the national economy” is also contributing to sellers’ hesitation to list apartments, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re hitting a point where it’s getting critical,” Mr. Miller said, adding that if inventory continues to be tight, “you’re going to see the prices edge higher.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, brokers say, apartments that are well priced are selling quickly and in some cases prompting bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s lots of competition for too few apartments,” said Pamela Liebman, chief executive officer of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. While it is not the kind of bidding wars that were common in the heady days of 2007, she noted, many buyers are frustrated by the lack of inventory and realize that “if they don’t move quickly on new listings, they won’t be there very long.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall inventory is not expected to loosen up, at least in the immediate future. “We’ll see a few exciting new developments hit the market in the next few months,” Ms. Liebman said, “but not enough really to move the needle.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory pipeline should start to pick up more significantly over the next 12 to 18 months, she noted. For now, as she put it, “It’s a good market, it’s just the inventory is terrible.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the market’s recovery in previous quarters was driven by luxury sales, the latest activity was weighted toward smaller apartments and first-time buyers taking advantage of low mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The lower end is coming into fruition now,” said Dottie Herman, the chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman, which showed in its report that one-bedroom apartments accounted for the bulk of the third-quarter sales at 37.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in one-bedroom sales pulled the market’s median price down 2.3 percent in the third quarter, to $890,000, according to Elliman. <span class="companylink">The Corcoran Group</span> said the median price was even from both last quarter and last year at $850,000, while reports by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property showed an increase of 2 percent from last year to $865,525.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the high end of the market, the average price dropped 4 percent to $1,377,630, as the sales pace slowed, according to Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. The number of apartments selling for $5 million or more were down 12 percent from the third quarter of 2011, and sales of apartments for $20 million or more fell to three from seven in the same period.</p>

</div><div class="author">By SHAILA DEWAN and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ   </div><div>942 words</div><div>26 September 2012</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market continues to gather strength, and the biggest gains in price now appear to be among the least expensive homes, whose values fell the most in the downturn and have weighed against any would-be recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the Standard &amp; Poor’s Case-Shiller[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/standard_poors_caseshiller_home_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] index showed an annual gain of 1.2 percent[http://bit.ly/UPXuK5] in the price of single-family homes across 20 cities in July, according to data released Tuesday. In addition, all 20 cities showed price increases from the previous month, the third monthly gain in a row, supporting the idea that the nation’s housing market has bottomed out and, some analysts said, contributing to an unexpected bump in consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury homes lost less value in the housing crisis and began to rebound more quickly, but lower-price homes are catching up, rising slightly faster in value than homes in the middle and upper tiers, according to an analysis of the Case-Shiller data by Patrick Newport and Michelle Valverde of IHS Global Insight, a private research firm in Lexington, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The typical lower-price home rose at an annualized rate of 1 percent from June to July on a seasonally adjusted basis. The middle tier posted a one-month gain of 0.4 percent, and the highest tier inched up by 0.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last three months, Mr. Newport said, the lowest tier has been rising in value more than twice as fast as the other two categories. For the least expensive homes, “prices just shot up too fast on the way up and then went down more sharply,” he said. “We’re seeing the correction from that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price cutoffs for each tier vary widely depending on the city. The cutoff for the lowest tier ranges from $86,000 in Atlanta to $349,000 in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data supports the trend. According to a report from Zillow,[http://www.zillow.com/corp/About.htm] a real estate Web site that divides homes into three price groups, the gap in price changes between the top and the bottom of the market is narrowing. “It’s less that the top tier is cooling than that the bottom tier is strengthening,” said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow. “The bulk of the recovery is due to the changes in the bottom and middle tiers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in Las Vegas, where housing prices are still slightly down over the last year, lower-end homes have ticked up in value, which may be good news for sellers but can be a hurdle for buyers. Mark Graham, a youth pastor who has been looking for a house for his family there for months, said buying a home for less than $150,000 could be a challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Houses are going on the market and within a day have multiple offers already on them,” Mr. Graham said, adding that most of the offers were from investors who did not need financing. “It’s more or less a heartbreaking market, because you get your heart set on a house, and then someone walks in with cash.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not every market is showing improvement on the low end, according to Case-Shiller. Atlanta and Chicago are still lagging, but in places like Boston and San Diego, the bottom third of houses are doing better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The majority of the cities have been more like Boston and San Diego,” said Maureen Maitland, a vice president at S.&amp; P. <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indexes, which produces the Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, which has shown the strongest recovery in housing prices of the 20 cities surveyed, the lowest third — homes under $127,000 — gained 33.5 percent from July 2011 to July 2012, while the top tier — homes above $211,000 — posted an 11.5 percent increase in that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have been bolstered by a decline in the number of foreclosure sales and strong interest from investors, who are buying low-price properties and converting them to rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Sarasota, Fla., area, investor demand has driven up prices for lower-end homes, said Roxanne Moore, a real estate agent with Green Lion Realty there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Investors are finding properties that they used to be able to buy for $80,000 or $90,000 are now going for $100,000,” she said. In addition, after a long absence, first-time home buyers are beginning to trickle back in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, home values in the first seven months of the year rose 5.9 percent, the best year-to-date performance in seven years. Nevertheless, the broad housing market is still nearly 30 percent below its high in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In four cities — Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas and New York — prices are lower than they were a year ago. In New York, including the surrounding suburbs, prices increased 1.2 percent from June to July, but remain 2.6 percent lower than they were in July 2011. Prices at the low end of the market — houses below $271,000 — have dropped 3.9 percent in the last year, while high-end homes — $437,000 or more — have dropped 2.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in an optimistic sign, consumer confidence rose in September[http://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm] to its highest level since February, according to a report released Tuesday by the Conference Board, a private group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer confidence index reached 70.3 points, well above economists’ expectations of 63 and a significant improvement from the upwardly revised level of 61.3 in August. Some analysts attributed the bump to gains in the stock market, while others credited the improved outlook for housing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Sales of existing homes rose in August to their highest rate in more than two years and new housing construction also climbed last month, providing signs that a budding housing market recovery is gaining traction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors[http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2012/09/august-existing-home-sales-and-prices-rise] said Wednesday that existing home sales increased 7.8 percent last month to an annual rate of 4.82 million units. That was well above economists’ expectations and the fastest rate since May 2010 when activity was being supported by a homebuyer tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American economy has grown at a lackluster pace this year and has struggled to create jobs, but the housing sector is a relative bright spot for the first time since the 2007-9 recession. “Housing is clearly in recovery mode,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for previously owned homes also rose when compared with a year earlier, a factor that could spur consumer spending by helping homeowners feel more confident about their finances. The median price nationwide for existing home resales rose 9.5 percent, to $187,400, the association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> is trying to help housing build more momentum, and last week it started a program to buy tens of billions of dollars in mortgage-backed securities, a move that could push interest rates lower for both new and refinanced mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect construction of new homes will contribute to economic growth this year for the first time since 2005, and a separate report from the Commerce Department buttressed that view. Builders broke ground on new homes at an annual rate of 750,000 units[http://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] last month, an increase of 2.3 percent, the department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Today’s data are another indication of improvement in the U.S. housing market,” said Andrew Grantham, an economist at CIBC World Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, housing starts fell short of expectations as groundbreaking on multifamily home projects fell and July’s pace was revised downward. At the same time, building permits slipped 1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have been creeping up and the steep decline in prices since 2006 appears to have bottomed. That has helped homebuilder sentiment, which this month touched a six-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said the share of so-called distressed sales — which include foreclosures[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and sales in which the owner owes more on a home than it is worth — fell last month, a factor that probably contributed to the rise in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed sales tend to go with a heavy discount, and the share of existing home resales in those conditions dropped to 22 percent last month, down from 24 percent in July. In August 2011 the distressed sales rate was 31 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation’s inventory of existing homes — those for sale on the market — rose 2.9 percent during the month to 2.47 million. But at August’s sales pace, that would supply the market for only 6.1 months, down from 6.4 months in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> is moving to keep mortgage rates low, it may have limited success in bolstering the housing market. Part of the reason is that lending standards for mortgages have tightened significantly since before the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">”While rates are at historical lows, borrowers still have a very difficult time accessing the mortgage markets,” said John Tashjian, principal at <span class="companylink">Centurion Real Estate Partners</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the average interest rate for a fixed 30-year mortgage fell 3 basis points, or three-hundredths of a percentage point, to 3.72 percent, the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN early August, Jorge Sanchez, a broker with Douglas Elliman, flew to Buenos Aires to sell some Miami real estate. He returned to Florida a few days later with four signed contracts from Argentines for apartments in a 60-story tower in downtown Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that the buyers signed the contracts without ever flying to Miami to see the building -- Opera Tower -- speaks volumes about how eager, and desperate, Argentines have been to direct their money out of their country and into real estate in Miami and New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past few months, Argentines have quietly passed Brazilians to become the most active group from Latin America buying Miami real estate, according to Millie Sanchez, executive vice president of development marketing for Douglas Elliman Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brazil's demotion from the top spot likely has something to do with the weakening of its currency, the real, versus the dollar in recent months. But in Argentina, a weakening peso and 25 percent inflation, economists say, have spurred many affluent Argentines to move their money into American real estate by expensive and sometimes illegal means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic and political uncertainty around the globe are benefitting real estate in the United States, especially in Miami and New York, the two ''safe haven'' American cities foreign investors usually look to first. South Florida's real estate market is certainly no stranger to capital flight from Latin America. But the velocity at which some Argentines are investing in Miami real estate has shocked some brokers here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The desperation of the Argentine people has taken over and they are actually market leaders here now,'' Ms. Sanchez said. ''Any project today in Miami is probably being sold 50 percent to the Argentines.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, Argentina's president, has been trying to stop the capital outflow, which nearly doubled to $21.5 billion last year from $11.4 billion in 2010, with increasingly severe methods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Argentines now have to submit requests to tax authorities to convert pesos into dollars for overseas trips, and are rarely approved for much. Overseas credit card purchases are heavily taxed at home. And specially trained dogs working for tax authorities are sniffing for dollars at ports, airports and border crossings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government began restricting access to dollars last November, days after Ms. Kirchner won a second four-year term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's driving all this? Argentina has struggled to preserve its hard-currency reserves in the Central Bank and sustain a trade surplus. The country has had limited access to international credit markets, owing to its inability to win back the confidence of global investors after its $100 billion default in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has refused to take on more debt, to rapidly devalue the peso, or to reduce spending, which it needs to sustain programs for the poor and working class that make up its voter base. Instead, Ms. Kirchner's government has chosen to clamp down on capital flight by whatever means possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks in Argentina are lending at rates some 10 percent under the inflation rate, economists say. There are few profitable investments left in the country, said Eduardo Blasco, a financial consultant in Buenos Aires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Argentines are buying foreign properties not only to park their savings but also to make extra income through rentals. ''Argentines don't want any more Argentine risk,'' Mr. Blasco said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they are willing to risk their savings on Miami real estate instead. At Opera Tower, at 1750 North Bayshore Drive, half of the 30 apartments sold in the past month were bought by Argentines, Ms. Sanchez said. Most were all-cash purchases, even though the developer, <span class="companylink">Florida East Coast Realty</span>, has offered to finance up to 65 percent of the purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After selling about a third of the building's 635 apartments before 2008, the developer turned the building into rentals after the housing crisis. Six months ago, Opera Tower began selling condos again. Since then some 90 apartments of the remaining 394 have gone into contract, said Luis Espinosa, the director of marketing for Florida East Coast Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building has become almost a pure investment play. Owners are occupying less than 5 percent of the apartments, which are selling for $250,000 to $650,000 for studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms, said Ana Tajes, Opera Tower's sales director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opera Tower is popular with Argentines because the developer is offering to lease back the apartments from the buyers, pay their monthly maintenance charges and give them an annual net rent equal to 6 percent of the purchase price for three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Argentines have also been scooping up apartments in Manhattan. Maria Velazquez, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman, met a group of Argentines in Miami earlier this month and accompanied them to New York. She said she has sold six apartments totaling $8 million to Argentines since last November, including four apartments at One Museum Mile, located at 1280 Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, Ms. Velazquez represented a group of Argentines that bid $10.35 million for eight apartments at 400 Fifth Avenue. They were later outbid, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They wanted to act fast and get their money out'' of Argentina, Ms. Velazquez said. ''Whoever buys in New York already has four or five apartments in Miami.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While her Argentine sales have been strong, Ms. Velazquez lately has been selling even more in New York to another skittish group from Latin America: Venezuelans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns about the Oct. 7 election in Venezuela, in which the 13-year incumbent, President Hugo Chavez, faces perhaps his stiffest challenge from Henrique Capriles, have led to a new exodus of cash from the country that is finding its way into New York real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year Ms. Velazquez said she has sold $35 million worth of Manhattan real estate to Venezuelans, including nine apartments at the Aldyn (60 Riverside Boulevard), three of which were $7 million penthouses of about 3,096 square feet each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast to about four years ago, when many Venezuelans struggled to wire large sums of money out of the country because of government restrictions, this time around they are using funds from accounts in Switzerland and the Virgin Islands, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Argentines are using money that was already waiting in American bank accounts. Others have been willing to pay a black-market premium of up to 40 percent to convert their money into dollars at home, and a commission of up to 7 percent to transfer funds abroad through a currency exchange house, an illegal transaction, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar restrictions have caused Argentina's own real estate market, which has traditionally been transacted in dollars, to flatten, as Argentines sit on their properties, said Marina Dal Poggetto, an economist in Buenos Aires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those that have properties don't want to sell in pesos, only in dollars,'' she said. ''But buyers don't have dollars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government controls are having a profound effect. Capital flight from Argentina plunged 69 percent to $3.57 billion in the first half of 2012, from $11.7 billion in the second half of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deserving part of the credit is Argentina's national tax agency, which has used a team of 50 specially trained dogs -- most of which are golden retrievers and Labradors -- to sniff out the dye in dollars and other foreign currencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kirchner government has boasted about the dogs' exploits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, the government said, Tiza found $110,000 in a car crossing into Uruguay. In July, Isidoro and Bruno, two other dogs, found $20,000 in a car trying to cross the border with Paraguay. Then last month, Catalina, which appeared to be a black Labrador, found 187,000 reals ($92,493) in the airbag of a Toyota Hilux at a border crossing with Brazil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The busts pass for black humor in Argentina these days. But a good chunk of the money that is managing to slip out by determined Argentines is finding its way into Florida and New York real estate, and for brokers here that is no laughing matter.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ANNIE LOWREY </div><div>864 words</div><div>15 September 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s ambitious effort to spur the recovery by aiding the housing market is likely to have a modest effect on home sales, given the pervasive weakness in the real estate market and the economy, analysts said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The incremental benefit of slightly lower mortgage rates will be small,'' wrote Paul Diggle, a property economist at Capital Economics, an international research firm, in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After all, most borrowers in a position to refinance have probably already done so. And it's not obvious why a would-be buyer who wasn't tempted by a 3.7 percent mortgage rate would be by, let's say, a 3.25 percent rate,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others echoed that view, saying that the Fed program would support a recovery at the margins of the housing market, but that lower mortgage rates themselves would not be enough to spur a stronger turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> announced a third major round of asset purchases intended to bring down interest rates and increase employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While the economy appears to be at a path of moderate recovery, it isn't growing fast enough to make significant progress reducing the unemployment rate,'' Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said at a news conference on Thursday. ''The weak job market should concern every American.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed pledged to buy mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $40 billion a month for an indefinite period of time. The effort is expected to increase prices and demand for those securities and push down mortgage rates, already near record lows. That might encourage more families to refinance their mortgages and others to purchase a home, with ripple effects through the real estate industry and the rest of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said it might help strengthen and quicken a tentative housing recovery. In recent months, housing sales and, in some cases, sale prices have ticked up. Builders have broken ground on new projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than six years since the real estate bubble started to deflate, many housing analysts said, if cautiously, that they believed the worst was over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement seems a signal that the Fed is confident that housing is turning around -- and that by itself could make home builders, mortgage financiers, real estate agents and buyers feel more confident as well, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's definitely a sense at the Fed that this channel could be one of the more promising channels,'' said Joseph E. Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''Sometimes people are looking for a reason to be optimistic,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday and Friday, financial markets cheered the Fed's announcement. Stocks climbed, as did the price of many of mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing analysts cautioned that the Fed effort was no panacea. Millions of homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, leaving them in no position to sell. Millions more are unemployed or underemployed, and unable to afford a home. The foreclosure crisis is continuing and credit is tight, leaving many people who would like to buy a house unable to get a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jed Kolko, the chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a real estate analytics firm, anticipated a muted effect on sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The big obstacles for people who want to buy are saving enough for a down payment and qualifying for a mortgage, because credit is still tight,'' Mr. Kolko said, saying that the Fed program would not directly address those problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kolko and other analysts also noted that hundreds of thousands of Americans had already refinanced their mortgages to take advantage of rates near record lows. (Mr. Bernanke, for instance, refinanced his Washington home last year, taking out a 30-year mortgage with a 4.25 percent interest rate.) That leaves the pool of homeowners potentially looking to refinance smaller than it otherwise would be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some analysts said that the Fed's promise to push mortgage rates lower and to keep them there would encourage servicers to expand their capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it will have a meaningful impact on the housing market,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. ''The refinancing boom is being tempered by the lack of capacity to refinance loans, because mortgage servicers are at full capacity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts also said that any effort by the Fed to make borrowing cheaper and to aid the economy would help the housing recovery -- increasing construction employment, household wealth and many other facets of the economy in turn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This makes housing a little bit more affordable,'' said Gus Faucher, senior macroeconomist at <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span>. ''But more important, it is designed to give some confidence to households and financial markets that the recovery is going to continue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi said: ''The main constraint on the recovery has been the housing market. Anything you can do to lift housing will have significant benefits for the economy.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NINE-BEDROOM GEORGIAN MANOR HOUSE ON 30 ACRES IN COUNTY LAOIS, IRELAND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$1.7 MILLION (1.35 MILLION EUROS)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This nine-bedroom Georgian home was built about 200 years ago on the outskirts of the village of Durrow in County Laois. The entrance is flanked by Doric columns, and the black-painted window shutters are original to the house. The front hall serves as a reception room with peach-colored walls, timber floors, and a white marble fireplace. To the right, a small sitting room at the front of the house has a wide doorway leading to the living room, which has butter-yellow walls and windows overlooking the garden. To the left of the front hall, there is a study and a dining room with a black marble fireplace and dark green wallpaper. The house’s spacious main kitchen is in the walk-out basement, a common feature of that period; it has a flagstone floor, a pantry, and a cream-colored Aga stove set into the old cooking hearth. There is a smaller kitchen on the first floor behind the dining room, which is used for serving larger meals for guests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landing between the first and second floors has a distinctive Georgian window, tall and narrow with an arched top bordered with elaborate molding. Upstairs, there are four bedrooms with en suite bathrooms. They include a master suite consisting of two connected bedrooms, each with a fireplace and decorative molding around the ceilings, and an en suite bath. The master bathroom has a free-standing bathtub with a hand-held shower attachment, a separate shower stall and a pedestal sink. A bedroom on the first floor functions as a sewing room, and there are four more bedrooms and a family room in the basement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This manor, known as Clonageera House, is set on 30 acres that include landscaped gardens and sheep pastures. A gardener’s cottage sitting beside an oval walled garden is among several outbuildings. There are also stables and a chicken coop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The village of Durrow is a 15-minute walk from the house. Its most famous landmark is the 18th-century Castle Durrow[http://www.castledurrow.com/], which is now a hotel. Ample shopping is found in the medieval city of Kilkenny, a 20-minute drive from the house. Dublin is about an hour away by car, along with Dublin Airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKET OVERVIEW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The housing market in Ireland remains weak at the moment,” said David Duffy, an economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute[http://www.esri.ie/] in Dublin. Unemployment is high, and it’s difficult to obtain a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for residential property in Ireland are down 50 percent, on average, from their 2007 peak. Prices have fallen even more steeply in Dublin — 57 percent for houses and 63 percent for apartments, Mr. Duffy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In County Laois, the picturesque farming area where this home is located, prices are down as much as 60 to 70 percent, according to Neala Keating, a director of the real estate firm Sherry Fitzgerald Hyland in Portlaoise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are signs of stabilization. Prices have ticked up slightly in Dublin over the last few months, Mr. Duffy said, and real estate agents are reporting an increase in bids on desirable properties. The most attractive properties are single-family homes in well-established areas. “There’s quite a bit of interest at the luxury-home level as well,” Mr. Duffy added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A country house in good condition costs 500,000 euros (or around $643,000) and upward in County Laois, according to Ms. Keating. Homes with land, such as the manor house profiled here, can fetch considerably more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO BUYS IN IRELAND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers in Ireland generally come from Britain and other Western European countries, said Kerstin Fenelon, a real estate agent for Savills Ireland in Dublin. Recently, Ireland has seen an increase in American buyers, who are drawn by the country’s bargain prices and an improved euros-to-dollars exchange rate, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In County Laois, British buyers are the most common, although Ms. Keating said she has also sold houses to Brazilian and Spanish buyers within the last year. She, too, has seen a spike of interest from buyers from the United States as well as Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYING BASICS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers face no restrictions in Ireland, according to Pat O’Hagan, a real estate agent with Savills Ireland and the listing agent for this property. “Everybody’s welcome,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest transaction cost is a stamp duty, paid to the Irish government. It was 9 percent of the purchase price until December 2011, Mr. O’Hagan said, when it was lowered to help stimulate sales. The current stamp duty is 1 percent of purchase price up to the first million euros, and 2 percent of the amount above the first million. Houses like Clonageera, with more than an acre of land, have a slightly different tax structure, Mr. O’Hagan said. The stamp duty on this house would be around 16,000 euros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the buyer and the seller typically hire a lawyer to check the documentation, the property lines, and other details. Legal fees vary depending on the size and complexity of the transaction, but are usually around 1 percent of the purchase price, Mr. O’Hagan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most cases, buyers don’t pay a commission to a real estate agent, but Mr. O’Hagan said buyers unfamiliar with the area are more likely to retain their own real estate agent to help them identify properties for sale. The fee for this service is usually 1 to 1.5 percent of the purchase price.</p>

</div><div class="author">By REUTERS   </div><div>1244 words</div><div>13 September 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>The International Herald Tribune</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DUBAI -- Not long ago, Mohammed Daoud was making good money hiring out halls for wedding parties thrown by a new class of Afghan war entrepreneurs. Now he is using some of the profits to buy a $160,000 apartment nestled amid the skyscrapers and shopping malls of Dubai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Daoud sees his 27th floor apartment as both a good investment and an insurance policy against the darkest scenarios he can envision for his homeland when the bulk of foreign forces leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nobody knows what's going to happen after 2014,'' he said in an interview in Kabul. ''If something happens with the security situation here, I can take my family. We feel safe in Dubai.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy Afghans have sharply increased the pace of investment in property in the Gulf emirate, motivated by a mix of commercial calculations and security fears brought on by the withdrawal of international troops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afghan buyers spent 220 million dirhams, or $60 million, on property in Dubai in the first six months of this year, a 27 percent increase compared with the same period in 2011, according to Dubai government data. Some Afghans are spending up to 20 million dirhams on shopping sprees for multiple villas while many are buying million-dollar homes with cash, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of the Afghan blitz outpaced a 21 percent increase in total purchases of Dubai property by both local and foreign investors in the same period. A steep decline in prices in the emirate's once white-hot property market has increased their interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend presents a fresh challenge to Western allies struggling to convince an uneasy Afghan population that the transition will not be a prelude to international abandonment or an escalation of fighting with the Taliban.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Haji Obaidullah Sader Khail, chairman of the Afghan Business Council-Dubai, said the true scale of Afghan investment could be four times higher than the data suggest because many transactions may not have been registered. ''I know people who have bought 15 to 20 villas,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the official figures, the number of properties Afghans bought in Dubai jumped to 114 in the first half compared with 76 in the same period in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports from real estate agents that Afghans routinely buy luxury homes with cash will do little to ease concerns that some of the billions of dollars the United States and its allies spend to bankroll the government and security forces is seeping abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Purchases by Afghans have gone up for sure. With the U.S. pulling out of Afghanistan a feeling of insecurity is setting in,'' said Parvees A. Gafur, chief executive of Propsquare Real Estate in Dubai. ''They want to invest before it's too late.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flood of cash exports from Kabul has stoked fears that entrenched graft and persistent capital flight from Afghanistan will make it harder to put a booming but fragile war economy on a more sustainable path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afghanistan's power elite has long cherished second, third or fourth homes in Dubai as footholds in a land of designer boutiques and safe districts only a three-hour flight from Kabul. Since the United States ousted the Taliban in 2001, lucrative and often badly supervised contracting opportunities offered by <span class="companylink">NATO</span> forces or civilian agencies have nurtured a new breed of oligarchs who boast ever more ostentatious addresses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With international forces scaling back, the rapid growth of the past decade is likely to slow. ''Spending from the U.S. and international community is going to decrease,'' said Ajmal Saifi, managing director of Prestige Real Estate in Dubai. Prestige is part of an Afghan family-run conglomerate that includes construction and retail interests in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty about who will replace President Hamid Karzai, who is expected to step down in 2014, has compounded investor anxieties in a patronage-driven economy where fortunes are won or lost as the political landscape shifts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under pressure from aid donors, Mr. Karzai has ordered ministries to take steps to fight corruption and told the Supreme Court to accelerate investigations into longstanding graft cases. Although few believe his call will have much impact, the announcements have caused jitters among Afghan plutocrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The traders are like birds, always looking for greener and more suitable places. But now they are flying from Afghanistan,'' said Khan Jan Alokozai, one of Afghanistan's most prominent traders and deputy chairman of the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce and Industries. ''They all fear that if the government starts to crack down on corruption, they will lose all they have earned. So it's a good time to take out as much as they can.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more uncertainty at home, the greater the incentive for Afghans to park their money abroad. Buyers jetting in from Kabul are mainly purchasing residential apartments worth between 3 million and 4 million dirhams, according to Mr. Gafur, the property dealer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some have found their dream home in the Palm Jumeirah, a frond-shaped development of luxury seafront villas whose vista of passing yachts is in stark contrast with the panorama of tawny hills that encircles Kabul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others have sought refuges in up-market developments with names like Emirates Living and Business Bay and in the needle-shaped Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank says it recorded $4.6 billion in declared dollar exports from Kabul airport last year, double the figure from the previous year. The authorities have taken steps to limit the amount of cash people take onto Dubai-bound aircraft, but it is difficult to measure their success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While much of the money may represent the proceeds of currency trading or licit commerce in a cash-based economy, Afghan and Western officials believe a share is derived from government corruption, the theft of aid or heroin trafficking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Security concerns have motivated many Afghan house-hunters to buy in Dubai, but some are primarily looking for bargains. Dubai real estate prices slumped by more than 60 percent from their peak in 2008 after the global economic crisis triggered a collapse in the emirate's property market. Prices have started to recover. The total value of real estate transactions in Dubai topped 63 billion dirhams in the first half of 2012. That was a 21 percent increase over the same period in the previous year. Of that, foreign investors paid 22 billion dirhams for 12,875 properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in Afghanistan, a sharp slowdown in the property market driven in part by doubts over the near term has encouraged investment in Dubai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Haji Shir Shah Ahmadzai, managing director of a real estate company in Kabul, said property prices in Afghanistan fell 35 percent to 50 percent in the past year. ''The only people who are selling properties are people who need money fast,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The propensity of rich Afghans to acquire assets in Dubai fell under the spotlight after a run at <span class="companylink">Kabul Bank</span>, the country's biggest private lender, in 2010. Dubai villas account for about $160 million of $900 million in assets auditors are trying to recover from the collapsed bank, which extended unsecured loans to a roster of well-connected individuals, according to a former senior Afghan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In June, the Afghan government told the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> that it had managed to retrieve properties in Dubai worth an estimated $44 million.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly four years after <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> touched off a worldwide financial crisis when it filed for bankruptcy protection on Sept. 15, 2008, the estate of the failed investment bank continues to control more than $10 billion of real estate assets in its $40.5 billion portfolio. And all of it eventually must be converted to cash to repay creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan alone, Lehman, which is now a trust company, owns several prominent properties including a 1.2-million-square-foot-office building at 237 Park Avenue, and On The Ave, a boutique hotel at 2178 Broadway on the Upper West Side. Its other assets -- more than 250 positions in all, down from more than 700 immediately after the bankruptcy filing -- range from small vacant lots to the scenic Moonlight Basin ski resort in Big Sky, Mont., the 2,000-acre Boot Ranch golf community in the Texas Hill Country, and hotels and condominium projects in Miami, New York and Maui, Hawaii.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its largest asset is Archstone, the Colorado-based apartment giant whose $22 billion takeover in 2007 helped create Lehman's fatal mountain of debt. One of the largest apartment owners in the nation, Archstone had 59,419 rental apartments in 181 properties as of March 31. Last month, Lehman registered Archstone for a public offering, hoping to use those proceeds to help pay its creditors. ''It's not universally known that we still have a very active portfolio that we're managing,'' said Jeff Fitts, head of real estate for <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>. Since filing for bankruptcy, Lehman has also reinvested $7 billion into the real estate portfolio, aiming to increase its creditors' ultimate return, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For casual observers, some confusion is understandable. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> acquired Lehman's 10,000-employee investment banking arm shortly after Lehman entered into the largest and possibly the most complicated bankruptcy filing in history. Lehman, which had huge mortgage security losses, retained illiquid assets on its balance sheet, including real estate assets or positions in major metropolitan and smaller markets in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan, then and now, has been to wait for better days in the real estate markets and eventually sell everything at prices unattainable in the financial crisis. And while Lehman was waiting for property values to recover from recessionary lows, the real estate team initiated plans to restructure troubled financing, correct other problems and fill its rentable buildings with tenants before offering them for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the early days, the opportunity funds would have gladly bought anything and everything that we were willing to sell for the right price. It just wouldn't have been advantageous to us,'' Mr. Fitts said. ''It's hard to explain to people the amount of restructuring and cleanup work that had to be done early on to get the properties to a state that they could be sold to nonopportunistic buyers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Lehman is on a mission to extract every dollar from the trust's holdings. Claims allowed against the estate amount to an estimated $361 billion as of March 31, according to a balance sheet review Lehman filed in July. Under its Chapter 11 plan, the trust began a wind-down period in January 2011 that is expected to recover $67.5 billion by the end of 2015, or soon thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman has already distributed $22 billion to creditors, who will receive about 18 cents on the dollar depending on their class and priority in the bankruptcy. A quarter of the roughly $40.5 billion in assets remaining to be disposed of is in real estate, including debt and equity positions, and Lehman has been gradually listing those properties for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the total Lehman has invested in its real estate holdings, some $3 billion went to buy the 53 percent of Archstone that Lehman did not already own, blocking an attempt by <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> to acquire part of the apartment giant. The real estate magnate Sam Zell is chairman of Equity Residential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other $4 billion of reinvestments was used to settle disputes, buy out partners, pay off debt or perform needed repairs and improvements to attract tenants and increase resale values. That includes property additions, such as the landscaped rooftop terrace that Lehman is building for tenant use at 816 Congress, an office building the company owns in Austin, Tex. Excluding Archstone, for every dollar Lehman has invested back into the portfolio, it is projecting more than $2 in returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only way to maximize the value of this real estate is to spend money and enhance it,'' Mr. Fitts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, for example, Lehman invested more than $200 million to retire debt and renovate 10 office properties it owned in partnership with Monday Properties in Rosslyn, a neighborhood in Arlington, Va. When Lehman sold its 78.5 percent ownership interest to <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> in October 2011, the three-million-square-foot portfolio was valued at more than $1.25 billion. Lehman would have made only a small fraction of that amount had it sold the portfolio at the time of the bankruptcy filing in 2008, before making improvements and in much softer market conditions, Mr. Fitts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across from Madison Square Park, Lehman restructured the debt on an 845,000-square-foot office building in which it owned equity at 200 Fifth Avenue and then worked with its partner, L&amp;L Holding Company, to bring in tenants. The building was 45 percent preleased when the debt was restructured, but occupancy had risen to 80 percent by the time Lehman sold its majority stake last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the dark days, our equity position on that building was worth almost nothing, and we pulled out way more than nothing when it sold,'' said Mr. Fitts, although he declined to disclose proceeds from the sale. Such well-located commercial properties, when fully leased to tenants who can be depended upon to pay their rent, are known in real estate circles as ''core'' assets. Core properties fetch higher prices than buildings with vacant space or those in need of investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our goal is to get a property to a core buyer,'' Mr. Fitts said. ''There are still assets in this portfolio that core buyers won't buy, but the 200 Fifths and the Rosslyns of the world sold to core buyers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman was wise to wait for better pricing before trying to sell its New York assets, said James Murphy, executive managing director in the New York office of <span class="companylink">Colliers International</span>, a commercial real estate company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price per square foot paid for core office buildings in Midtown this year is $741, still short of the peak price level of $947 reached in 2008, Mr. Murphy said. Recent office building sales on Park Avenue, however, have drawn prices ranging from $900 per square foot to nearly $1,100 per square foot, he said. The size and location of 237 Park will attract a variety of core investors, Mr. Murphy predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate was only one of several factors that combined to push Lehman into bankruptcy, according to Lawrence Longua, a clinical associate professor at the New York University Schack Institute of Real Estate. ''It was really a confidence or credibility issue,'' he said. ''Nobody would do business with them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Longua expressed confidence that Lehman's strategy of waiting for the market to recuperate before trying to convert its assets to cash would result in a greater recovery than would have been generated in a rapid liquidation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I admire what Lehman is doing because at the end of the day, what they're doing isn't going to be benefiting anybody at Lehman,'' Mr. Longua said. ''Lehman is still an entity that over the long term is going to be going out of business. The beneficiaries of all of this will be their creditors.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE </div><div>1342 words</div><div>12 September 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOSTON -- In a blockbuster deal last fall, Jamestown Properties paid $226 million for a 130,000-square-foot portfolio spread over 28 buildings, mostly on Newbury Street -- the fashionable thoroughfare that hosts shops ranging from a Chanel boutique to nail salons in 19th-century town houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then, Jamestown, a real estate company based in Atlanta, chased retailers leaving malls for urban downtowns. A year later, Jamestown finds itself in a booming commercial property submarket, with nearly $2 billion in other projects that are planned or already being built. Those developments include new or renovated buildings that will house an expanded Chanel store and a <span class="companylink">Restoration Hardware</span> outlet, and plans for a $500 million redevelopment of Copley Place mall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown bought in Boston's Back Bay because the district had long been a sound property market, said Michael Phillips, chief operating officer at Jamestown. The current boom ''is an added benefit,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is progressing on its promise to enhance the Newbury Street shopping experience, but some of that progress is not yet visible. Jamestown has brought in 10 new retailers, begun $4.7 million in renovations and plans to invest another $5 million in building upgrades in the next five years. The current construction will create 15,835 square feet of renovated retail space and 11 rental apartments for a total of 50 luxury residential units. In some of its 28 buildings, Jamestown is creating or refashioning entrances on the lower levels. The largest, most noticeable project is the 10-month rehabilitation of adjoining buildings at 234 and 236 Newbury Street due for completion in the coming winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Last year, our thinking was to follow the migration of better retailers from malls and onto a city street that has a real sense of place, historic architecture and is known as an independent shopping district,'' Mr. Phillips said. Jamestown, which has $4.3 billion in assets and is backed largely by American and European investors, has experience with retail assets in similarly distinctive downtown locations, including Fifth Avenue and the Meat Packing District in Manhattan, Georgetown in Washington and Union Square in San Francisco. New retailers brought to Newbury Street by Jamestown include the clothing boutiques Fred Perry, Bonobos and Jiberish, and the Australian skin care company Aesop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown's plans to reinvigorate Newbury Street have been affirmed by about $2 billion in other mixed use development that is under way or being planned on the street and nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After lagging during the economic slowdown, development and retail activity on Newbury Street and the whole Back Bay has returned to peak levels, making it the city's healthiest retail district,'' said Randi Lathrop, deputy director of planning for the Boston Redevelopment Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Newbury Street retail market is 3.5 percent vacant, the lowest rate for the city's retail districts, which average 10 percent vacancy, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Newbury Street, a 49,000-square-foot building under construction will house a three-story Chanel store and six residences. A few blocks down, <span class="companylink">Restoration Hardware</span> plans to move into a 40,000-square-foot building undergoing renovation. Within a few blocks, Liberty Mutual's $300 million, 590,000-square-foot office building is under construction. <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span>, already a major neighborhood landlord, is constructing a $100 million, 188-unit, 28-story apartment building. The <span class="companylink">Berklee College of Music</span> is building a $100 million tower for academic and residential use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Back Bay, the Simon Group is planning a $500 million redevelopment and expansion of the Copley Place mall. The New England Conservatory of Music recently won city approval for a $130 million development. The city also approved the Christian Science Center plan for a 1.2-million-square-foot mixed-use development. Three other major projects that include offices, residences and retail are being planned around Boylston Street, one block from Newbury Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for Back Bay offices, whose workers shop and dine in the neighborhood, is stronger than ever, with robust investment sales and little available space, said Robert E. Griffin Jr., president of Cushman &amp; Wakefield New England. ''Pricing is back to the 2007 peak, cap rates are as low as the 4 percent range, and asking rents -- up to $80 a square foot -- are rising,'' he said. With luxury residential development under way, ''strong office fundamentals are drawing investors who crave yield,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leading the latest spate of sales was last year's $930 million purchase by <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span> of the John Hancock Tower. That is a 4.3 percent capitalization rate, the initial rate of return on a property, expressed as a ratio of the current income relative to the purchase price, said Mr. Griffin, whose capital markets team brokered the deal. The seller, Normandy Real Estate Partners and Five Mile Capital Partners, bought it in 2009 for $660 million and realized a profit nearing $200 million, industry sources said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies flock to the Back Bay because the employees they seek to attract and retain want to live, work and play in the neighborhood, which is well served by mass transit and highways. As a result, the office market was 4.7 percent vacant by midyear and the average asking rent was $50.95 per square foot, compared with a 12 percent vacancy and average asking rent of $45.34 per square foot for the overall downtown office market, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. Retail sales in the area are up to $1,250 per square foot, while rents are hitting $200 per square foot, said Ted Chryssicas, an executive vice president at <span class="companylink">Colliers International</span> and a longtime retail specialist. ''Rents are close to peak and likely to rise,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Newbury Street, ''Jamestown is a huge plus, and we'll see the change they bring in three to five years,'' he said. ''With a big portfolio they can execute on their vision to move the street more toward being an international high street reminiscent of those in Europe.'' For example, the street could use more chef-driven restaurants, but for most such businesses, rents may be too high, he said. However, he added: ''Jamestown knows what it takes to bring in the right tenant mix and will subsidize deals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last October, Jamestown bought the bulk of its portfolio, which makes up 15 percent of Newbury Street's buildings, from a joint venture of Taurus Investment Holdings and UrbanMeritage, both based in Boston, and Anglo Irish Private Investors, an affiliate of <span class="companylink">Anglo Irish Bank</span>. The remaining five buildings were bought from a partnership of Taurus and <span class="companylink">Federal Realty Investment Trust</span> of Rockville, Md. Taurus and UrbanMeritage took five years to assemble their portfolio, brand it as the Newbury Line and upgrade the tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, Charles M. Talanian, owner of C. Talanian Realty, owned the largest number of Newbury Street buildings. With 22 properties that encompass approximately 250,000 square feet, he is still the dominant presence there, and he said that business was very good with retail sales ranging from $400 to $1,200 per square foot. He is redeveloping two buildings into a retail space with 8,000 square feet, up from 4,000 square feet. For a few years, he said, Taurus and UrbanMeritage were ''buying up a storm,'' paying $1,000 to $1,800 per square foot compared with the customary $800 to $1,000 per square foot. ''Jamestown bought in four months, what it took me and my father 43 years to put together,'' he said. Its renovations and new tenants ''help everyone,'' he added. ''It isn't competition; it will boost my property values.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last year, Jamestown's new leases have raised its occupancy rate to 83 percent, from 76 percent, Mr. Phillips said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CABO SAN LUCAS, MEXICO -- Compared with other premium waterfront resort areas around the world, real estate in the Los Cabos region is on sale. But buying at the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula these days involves a gamble on who will win the drug war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The media is painting Mexico with too broad of a brush,'' says Marc Rodriguez, general manager of the five-star Esperanza Resort, which in June hosted the U.S. delegation, including President Barack Obama and the secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, during a <span class="companylink">Group of 20</span> industrialized nations meeting. ''This country has its problems, but we are safe here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Legg, a Canadian banker, says he did not hesitate to spend slightly less than $1 million for a three-bedroom unit totaling 186 square meters, or 2,000 square feet, in the newly developed Hacienda Beach Club &amp; Residences in Cabo San Lucas. ''I've been coming to Cabo for over a decade, and feel just as safe here, as I do at home,'' Mr. Legg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Mr. Legg's unit and six other homes have sold in the development, for a total of $15 million. (While pesos are used for most Mexican sales, top-end projects usually are priced in U.S. dollars.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of State</span> has posted a detailed travel warning for Mexico but, while travelers are cautioned about visiting much of Baja California, the document says ''no advisory is in effect'' for Cabo San Lucas. Canada generally advises caution when visiting the country, but does say that nonessential travel to northern states, including northern Baja California, should be avoided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October 2011 six people died in a series of gun battles in a Cabo San Lucas shopping mall but the incident was never proven to be drug related.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, it is known that several of Mexico's prominent drug lords use Los Cabos as their own refuge. In fact, while Mrs. Clinton was about 400 yards, or 366 meters, away, Mexican officials went door-to-door looking for Joaquín Guzmán, also known as ''El Chapo,'' the head ofthe Sinaloa cartel. The search was unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Los Cabos is safe because it is under the rule of one drug cartel, the Sinaloa Federation,'' says Sylvia Longmire, author of ''Cartel,'' which was published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The security specialist and consultant also notes that Los Cabos is not a drug port -- unlike Acapulco (where the local real estate association says prices are down 44 percent from the start of this year). That resort is the shipping point for most of the world's supply of cocaine from Colombia. However, she added, ''The drug cartel landscape is very volatile and can change within six months. When two cartels fight for control of an area, it results in killings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, at least, ''If you want to go and stay at a five-star resort or housing complex, you're secure,'' Ms. Longmire said. ''It's when you go outside that you put yourself in danger.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many developments and resorts have put a lot of effort into security arrangements in recent years, not all immediately visible to homeowners or guests. At Esperanza, for example, there are two entry checkpoints, guards roam the beach, and there are hidden cameras in the gardens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even though the resort has not had a significant crime problem, prices for its fractional ownership units have dropped 30 percent since 2006. Six weeks a year in a two-bedroom luxury unit with marble bathrooms and a Jacuzzi now sells for $200,000, plus annual fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such declines are widespread. Real estate prices throughout Los Cabos had soared until the market decline of 2006. Prices almost immediately dropped around 35 percent, and values have dipped even more since the drug war began capturing more headlines in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $5,900 a square meter, or about $550 a square foot, buyers can purchase homes with direct views of the Sea of Cortez in compounds where Michael Dell, Cindy Crawford, George Clooney and Tim Allen have bought homes. When the area was first developed in 1995, properties in the area were going for about $1,000 a square meter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Americans traditionally have been the target buyers in the region, Canadians, Argentines, Russians and Chinese are now becoming more common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People who buy here, have been coming here for years and know this is just as safe as Arizona, but it's a better investment,'' said Chris Snell, director of Snell Real Estate in San José del Cabo, who has been selling in the area for 15 years. ''They don't ask about the crime because they know the actual crime rates are low if they've been coming here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says the chief executives of Fortune 100 companies and Hollywood stars regularly fly private jets to the region -- an indicator of wealth that would make the owner a target for kidnapping, ransom or death in other parts of Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mexican government itself also has invested heavily in the Los Cabos area, partly to keep tourism alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can't take tourism for granted,'' wrote Gloria Guevara Manzo, Mexico's secretary of tourism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tourism officials expect 52 million tourists to arrive this year -- a good sign for the real estate market because the majority of Cabo's foreign buyers started as tourists, visiting the area about five times before deciding to purchase.</p>

</div><div class="author">By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ   </div><div>835 words</div><div>30 August 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government data released Wednesday suggested the economy continued to muddle along at a subdued pace, highlighting the pressure on Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, to come up with bolder policy prescriptions Friday when he delivers a widely anticipated speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the economy looming as the leading issue in the presidential race, Mr. Bernanke faces a delicate decision. Though economic growth remained weak by historical standards, fears that the United States is slipping back into a recession have abated. In any event, previous rounds of monetary easing have generated only modest benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More aggressive steps to stimulate the economy will also draw criticism from Republicans, who have demanded that Mr. Bernanke forswear additional monetary moves for now. Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, said last week that he was opposed to a third round of easing, which is intended to put downward pressure on interest rates and encourage businesses and consumers to borrow and spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic growth remains too anemic to bring down the nation's stubbornly high levels of unemployment, leading to some calls for action by the Fed. Most economists expect Mr. Bernanke to wait until after <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> policy makers meet on Sept. 12-13 to announce major actions, but the latest reports underscore just how tepid economic growth remains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department revised upward its estimate of economic growth in the second quarter to an annual rate of 1.7 percent, from an earlier estimate of 1.5 percent. That growth still represents a deceleration from the 2 percent pace in the first quarter. The economy needs to grow at 2.5 percent to 3 percent a year to substantially reduce unemployment, which is at 8.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revision was driven by stronger export growth, along with fewer imports than originally estimated and a slight uptick in personal consumer spending. Inventory growth cooled, highlighting continued caution by businesses about the overall outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not disastrous, but it is one reason the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> is on high alert,'' said Julia Lynn Coronado, chief economist for North America at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>. She said she expected economic growth to slow to 1.3 percent in the third quarter and improve slightly to 1.8 percent in the fourth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign of tepid economic conditions, a <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> report issued Wednesday afternoon found that the economy continued to expand gradually across the country in July and early August, with slower growth in parts of the East Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed survey of 12 regional bank districts, known as the beige book, also found that employment held steady or grew slightly nationwide, with weaker-than-expected results in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Richmond districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing sector was ''mixed,'' according to the report, with six districts reporting that demand for manufactured goods had decreased. On the other hand, the Fed said retail spending had risen in most areas since July's beige book report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising uncertainty about the presidential election in November and fiscal policy in the United States are crimping growth, Ms. Coronado said, along with continuing fears about Europe's debt problems and a slowdown in China's once-booming economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many companies are holding off on expansion moves as they await the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts in January, along with budget reductions that are set to go into effect unless Congress comes up with a deal to cut the deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some brighter spots in the economy, including the housing sector, which until recently had shown few signs of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales in July rose to their highest level in more than two years, according to data released on Wednesday by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. The Pending Home Sales Index, reflecting contracts but not closings, rose 2.4 percent from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the latest figures from the S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller Home Price Index showed that home prices rose 1.2 percent nationally in June from a year ago. Home prices remain down almost a third from their peak in 2006, but a firming market is welcome relief in a cloudy picture.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some of the cities that suffered the most in the housing bust are showing signs of improvement, with prices beginning to recover in places like Miami, Atlanta and Detroit, according to the latest housing data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, there is improvement across the board, with home prices nationally inching up over their levels a year ago for the first time since 2010, when sales were helped by a temporary tax credit for home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data is contained in the S.&amp;P./Case-Shiller Home Price Index[http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&amp;blobcol=urldocumentfile&amp;blobtable=SPComSecureDocument&amp;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3Ddownload.pdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobheadername1=content-type&amp;blobwhere=1245339137830&amp;blobheadervalue3=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&amp;blobnocache=true], which tracks prices nationally and in 20 major cities. Both showed gains over the past year, from June to June — 1.2 percent nationally, and 0.5 percent in the 20 cities. Though prices were still depressed in a few of the cities compared with a year ago, every one of them showed price gains from May to June. The report is highly regarded because it tracks actual price differences as a home is sold and resold over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are still down almost a third from their peak in 2006, but most recent reports are pointing to a slow recovery and increased optimism that could encourage potential buyers to take the plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, the city with the biggest one-year decline in home prices, the market perked up by about 4 percent in May and again in June, according to nonseasonally adjusted numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detroit prices increased 6 percent from May to June, while in Miami, prices rose by 1.4 percent in May and 1.6 percent in June. A surge in prices is to be expected in June, a time when the market ordinarily heats up, but analysts called these increases particularly strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing went from being a huge engine of growth to a drag on the economy as inventories swelled, foreclosures[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] mounted and prices crashed. More recently, economists have pointed to a slow turnaround[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/business/housing-report-continues-signs-of-weak-revival.html], saying it is once again contributing to the nation’s economic output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors have helped: investors have bought cheap properties, reduced inventory has led to competitive bids, and lower interest rates have buoyed buyers — at least those who can qualify for a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of foreclosures has declined as banks responded to tightened oversight in some jurisdictions. After the national settlement[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/09/business/states-negotiate-25-billion-deal-for-homeowners.html] over foreclosure abuse, housing counselors report that banks are taking more aggressive measures to keep homeowners in their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists warned of potential dangers that could still hold home buyers back. Consumer confidence unexpectedly dropped in August, the Conference Board reported[http://www.conference-board.org/press/pressdetail.cfm?pressid=4582] Tuesday, largely because of diminished expectations for the future. The November election and the “fiscal cliff” of expiring tax breaks and looming spending cuts at the end of the year may also be muting home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All those kinds of things will weigh on housing because it’s still a big decision and a big purchase for people,” said David M. Blitzer, the chairman of the index committee for S.&amp; P. Dow Jones Indices, which produces the home price index. “But all the underpinnings look better.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ed Stansfield[http://www.capitaleconomics.com/staff/property-economics/ed-stansfield.html], the chief property economist for Capital Economics, warned that the euro zone crisis could set off another financial disaster that would keep people from buying homes. “Even so,” he wrote, “with prices rising at an annualized rate of close to 10 percent in the second quarter, without another major shock, house prices are more likely to surprise on the upside than the downside this year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the strongest showings could be seen in many cities in the South and West that were among those hit hardest. When home prices were rising, places like Phoenix and Las Vegas were growing rapidly and real estate was a major part the local economy. Homes there lost more than half their value, according to Case-Shiller data. But while Las Vegas has shown little movement, recovering 4.5 percent from its trough, Phoenix has rebounded by 14 percent, San Francisco by 18 percent and Atlanta by 11 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi[http://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/], chief economist for <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> Analytics, said the Phoenix economy is more diverse than Las Vegas’s, so the job market started to recover sooner and investors have been more eager to buy. “That said,” he added, “I don’t think the Vegas economy and housing market are too far behind.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Places that showed relatively small declines, like Denver and Dallas, have shown correspondingly small upticks in prices. In Washington, which is somewhat shielded from recessions by the presence of the federal government, homes lost a third of their value but have recovered by more than 14 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Union Beach</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARCO OLDHAFER, who spent a month with a crane hundreds of feet tall dominating the view from the upstairs deck on his house, has now been able to rediscover the unimpeded vista he so loved, of the sunset over the marshes of Raritan Bay. And it hasn’t been restored a moment too soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crane and the marred seascape constitute the latest evidence of an ongoing dispute between the Bayshore Regional Sewerage Authority[http://www.bayshorersa.com/] and the town of Union Beach over plans to build a 380-foot wind turbine within proximity of many houses in this Monmouth Beach coastal community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Aug. 10, a state appeals court overturned a lower-court ruling that last year found the sewerage authority within its rights to build the turbine to cut energy costs. The appellate ruling ordered the authority to return to Union Beach’s governing bodies to seek a zoning clarification, which would either allow the turbine construction to go forward or require a variance. In the meantime, the court commanded the authority to dismantle the towering crane, which went up in July in preparation for the final installation of the turbine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was soon after the erection of the crane that Vince Camarda decided to sell his four-bedroom Dock Street house just 1,100 feet from the site of the proposed wind turbine. Mr. Camarda bought the house in 2006 for $287,000, and spent an additional $25,000 buying and clearing a lot behind his house to extend his yard. Over the next 18 months, he said, he spent another $120,000 rebuilding the house. The property is now on the market for $399,000, but Mr. Camarda says he hasn’t received a single call from an interested buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People know this turbine is coming, and nobody wants to be here,” he said. “My house is only on the market because of this. I don’t want to move. I love this town.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With home values a major reason for their concern, more than 80 percent of Mr. Camarda’s fellow residents in this town of 6,245 oppose the turbine, according to Bill Heller, a resident and the creator of the Web site noturbine.com[http://noturbine.com], which documents the history of the Union Beach battle as well as controversies surrounding similar energy-producing systems around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would have given it 50-50 before, but now I think we can win this one,” Mr. Heller said. “And if we do, I think the towns that are involved are going to look to recover for their ratepayers some of the money that’s been spent so far on this thing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment so far has been close to $5 million, according to Robert C. Fischer, the executive director of the Bayshore Regional Sewerage Authority. With the wind turbine parts in storage in Newark, the authority has asked the appellate court to reconsider its decision and is gearing up for another round with the town’s zoning and planning boards. At the heart of the dispute is a 2008 zoning update that reclassified most of the property near the site of the proposed turbine as residential, although until then it had been an industrial zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It has to be addressed,” Mr. Fischer said. “We can’t remain a 24-acre waste treatment plant in a residential zone. This is bigger than the wind turbine. We’re in jeopardy of violating our environmental permits with anything we need to do down the line.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal in proposing the wind turbine back in 2009 was to reduce expenses at the sewage treatment plant, which serves eight communities in northern Monmouth and Middlesex Counties and treats 16 million gallons of wastewater each day. Last year’s operating costs of $800,000 could be cut in half by the energy provided from the wind turbine, Mr. Fischer said, noting that the savings could be passed along to homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But residents served by the sewerage authority say such savings would be negligible, and are not worth having to live with 120-foot blades constantly rotating above their heads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Mr. Oldhafer has no plans to sell his house, he is concerned about his investment in Union Beach. In 1998 he paid $94,000 for a bungalow at the end of Bay Avenue, across from Raritan Bay. Three years ago he spent $240,000 replacing the bungalow with a 2,400-square-foot house, the upstairs rooms of which provide a 180-degree view of the bay. If the turbine was installed, Mr. Oldhafer said, his house — 1,200 feet from the site — would lose significant value. He estimated his sewer bill would go down by only $18 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They have 23,000 customers and claim they’ll save $400,000 from the turbine,” he said. “If you divide it, I’m going to save about $18 a year, but I’m going to lose about $50,000 value on my house. I’d rather just pay the bill if that’s O.K.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fischer said the Bayshore authority had hired an appraiser to evaluate the impact on housing prices in neighborhoods near the Jersey Atlantic Wind Farm, five turbines installed in Atlantic City in 2005. Measuring property values before, during and after the installation, the appraisal found “no difference at all,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wind turbine has become the most discussed issue in Union Beach. Those living near the proposed site say they worry about the psychological impact of high-frequency noise and strobe effects of constantly whirring blades. Mr. Camarda said he was afraid his 3-year-old son, Charles, who likes to help him in the garden, would be scared by the noise of the turbine. Expressing the views of many here, Stuart Lieberman, the lawyer representing Union Beach against the sewerage authority, said the authority had overstepped its bounds and should now pack it in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Since when did a sewerage plant get to risk everyone’s happiness in a community?” he asked. “You’re not supposed to see them, or smell them. They ought to be in the background, doing what they do, which is processing human waste, and they need to get back to that.”</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) — Sales of new homes rose 3.6 percent in July to match a two-year high reached in May, the latest sign of a recovery in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Thursday that sales of new homes reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 372,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report is “the latest in a series of data points suggesting a durable housing recovery is under way,” Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at the brokerage firm BTIG, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last 12 months, sales of new homes have jumped 25 percent. Still, the increase is from a historically low level. Sales remain well below the annual pace of 700,000 that economists consider healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sluggish economy continues to weigh on the housing market, as unemployment remains high at 8.3 percent. On Thursday, the government reported a slight increase in the number of people applying for first-time unemployment benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has still made a modest recovery in part because homes are more affordable. Mortgage rates have fallen to near-record lows. Housing prices are about a third lower than at the peak of the housing bubble in 2006. Those trends have helped lift sales of new and previously occupied homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes increased 2.3 percent in July from June, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Wednesday. Sales have jumped 10 percent in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home, however, slipped 2.1 percent in July from June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though new homes represent only a small portion of the housing market, they have a disproportionate impact on the economy. Each home built creates an average of three jobs for a year and generates about $90,000 in tax revenue, according to statistics compiled by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has a long way to go to reach full health. Some economists have forecast that sales of previously occupied homes will rise 8 percent this year to about 4.6 million. That would still be well below the 5.5 million annual sales pace that is considered healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One trend restraining sales is that many people are still having difficulty qualifying for home loans. Banks have tightened credit standards for mortgages, according to a report by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>. Another factor holding back sales is that fewer new homes are available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said that the number of people seeking first-time jobless benefits rose a slight 4,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 372,000, evidence that the recovery in the job market remained modest. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, increased 3,750 to 368,000, the Labor Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With applications for jobless benefits rising for two weeks, some economists say that hiring in August might slow from the solid gain of 163,000 jobs in July.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are hailing the beginnings of a recovery in the nation’s housing market. But to beleaguered homeowners, it will not feel like much of one for many months to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of existing homes sold rose 2.3 percent in July from the previous month, according to figures released Wednesday. Volume was up more than 10 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For several months, economic data and accounts from real estate agents across the country have calmed fears that the overall market could take another big step down, giving prospective home buyers some assurance that prices were stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the nascent recovery is still a convalescent one, with the pace of activity uneven and far below the levels reached before the bubble burst. Home prices remain under pressure in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Wednesday’s report from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> showed that average sales prices actually dipped slightly from June to July. This seeming contradiction — increasing demand but anemic growth in home values — could represent a new normal in the housing market, experts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents across the country cited the weak job market, stagnant wages and tight lending standards as continuing restraints on prices, despite pent-up demand and mortgage[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/loans/mortgages/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] rates near record lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even relatively optimistic observers like Michelle Meyer, an economist with <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, foresaw only gradual improvements in home values. She expected home prices to rise 2 percent annually in 2012 and 2013, with momentum gradually increasing later in the decade. At that rate, the average home price would regain its 2006 peak in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Inventory is lower and construction is incredibly depressed,” she said. “But it’s bumpy. We could see prices weaken slightly in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Abbruzzese, a retired farmer from upstate New York, was in southwest Florida this week bargain hunting for a second home. “I wanted to get down here before the snowbirds arrive,” he said. He was looking at five or six properties in the low- to mid-$100,000s before he left New York, but by the time he arrived in Florida only one was left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Abbruzzese said that while prices had increased in recent months, he was betting that they would rise still more after the presidential election restored some certainty to the country’s political course. “I think people are really scared right now; they’re not spending the money,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new buyers might take comfort in the fact that deep declines in home values seem to have passed, more than 11 million current homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. In July, home sales were running at an annual pace of 4.47 million, an improvement over a year ago, but well below the high of 7.25 million reached in September 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales also were picking up, lifting share prices for many home builders. On Wednesday, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> reported a sharp rebound in profits, lifting its stock 3.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of factors have helped nudge prices higher, including shrinking inventory — particularly on the more affordable end of the market. There is about a six-month supply of homes, according to the Realtors’ group, down from more than nine months last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, the supply of houses has become so slim that agents protested a bulk sale of 500 foreclosed houses by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, the mortgage giant, saying there was no need to sell the homes at a discount to investors when there were retail buyers willing to buy them. (Most of the properties would not have been sold individually because they were occupied by renters.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns that a flood of distressed properties will soon hit the market were also receding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks have been taking more aggressive measures to avert foreclosures[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], which have been declining for almost two years, according to RealtyTrac. Short sales, the practice of allowing homeowners to sell their property for less than they owe before the home reaches the auction block, are on the rise. Some banks have recently introduced “deed for lease” initiatives to convert delinquent owners into renters instead of evicting them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of distressed properties, which act as a drag on prices, represented 24 percent of all activity, down from 29 percent a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The broad opinion is that housing is definitely improving and on the upswing,” said David Blitzer, the chairman of the index committee for S.&amp; P.’s Dow Jones Indices, which produces the Case-Shiller Home Price Index. “And that is a positive factor for the economy as well.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some areas, real estate brokers were skeptical that any improvement would be sustained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Parra, a real estate agent in Las Vegas, said investors who had been fueling the market with cash purchases were starting to get cold feet, fearing values would not appreciate further as long as incomes lag and jobs are scarce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You’re going to have a catfish market,” Mr. Parra said. “You know, catfish stay on the bottom and they occasionally jump up to the surface.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists like to caution that there is no such thing as a national real estate market. Results vary widely from place to place, and some of the biggest increases in prices have come in parts of the country hit the hardest when the housing boom turned to bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Phoenix fell 55.9 percent from June 2006 through September 2011, when they bottomed, according to the Case-Shiller index. Since then, they have risen 8.8 percent. And in San Francisco, which had a 46.1 percent decline, prices have recovered 10.6 percent from the low in March 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More typical is Chicago, which hit a low in March 2012. Prices there have risen 1.1 percent since then. Case-Shiller is still showing a slight decline nationally in average prices over the past year, but analysts will be closely watching data due out next week for signs of a turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara Gargiulo, a real estate broker in northern New Jersey, said market conditions in her area varied widely. Montclair, she said, has only a two-month supply of houses on the market — far less than some of its neighbors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, she said, a house that sold last year for $620,000 sold again this year for $650,000, above its list price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think we’ll have some small little peaks, small little valleys, but in general we’ll see an upward curve over the next few years,” she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll Brothers[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/toll-brothers-inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org], the largest luxury home builder in the United States, reported its highest revenue since the recession of 2008, underlining the recovery in the housing market and sending its shares to a five-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, which focuses on affluent customers who typically make at least $100,000 a year and have spotless credit records, reported an increase in orders and forecast higher revenue for the full year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are enjoying the most sustained demand we have experienced in over five years,” Toll’s chief executive, Douglas C. Yearley Jr., said in a statement. “The housing recovery is being driven by pent-up demand, very low interest rates and attractively priced homes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, which fell into a deep rut six years ago prompting a recession, has been recovering this year. Home sales have risen, helped by higher rental rates and low inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales rose in July as low interest rates and a modest improvement in the labor market helped home buying conditions, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other home builders, such as <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> and the <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> have reported strong results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Housing is on the mend,” Toll’s executive chairman, Robert I. Toll, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said it was gaining market share as small and midsize private builders, its primary rivals, are strained for capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll is the only publicly traded luxury home builder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The pace of our contract growth has far exceeded the national housing data as we are gaining market share,” Mr. Yearley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll’s net signed contracts rose 57 percent to 1,119 units during May-July. Backlog jumped 59 percent to $1.62 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yearley said Toll’s nonbinding reservation deposits, an indication of future contracts, increased 59 percent in the first three weeks of the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company forecast home-sale revenue of $1.71 billion to $1.84 billion for 2012. It raised the lower end of its full-year home delivery outlook range by 300 units to 3,000. It expects to deliver up to 3,200 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll’s profit rose to $61.6 million, or 36 cents a share, from $42.1 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue in the period, which ended July 31 and was the third quarter of <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>’ fiscal year, increased 41 percent, to $554.3 million from $394.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock in Toll, which is based in Horsham, Pa., rose $1.20, or 3.8 percent, to $33.01 a share.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ANN CARRNS   </div><div>450 words</div><div>23 August 2012</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2012 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's underwater homes are slowly resurfacing as the housing market improves[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/business/housing-report-continues-signs-of-weak-revival.html]. But younger borrowers are still more likely to be submerged, a new report from real estate site <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span> finds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall levels of negative equity improved in the second quarter of the year compared with the first quarter, as home values continue to rise. But about half of borrowers under 40 still owe more than their homes are worth, the analysis found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Younger borrowers are more likely to be affected by negative equity in part because they generally have been in their home for shorter periods of time and had less time to build equity before the housing debacle. But on the bright side, younger borrowers tend to be in relatively "shallow" water compared to older borrowers and are less likely to be delinquent on payments, said Stan Humphries, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disproportionate impact on younger borrowers may actually have a helpful effect on home values, by creating tight inventory of homes for sale. Younger borrowers trapped by negative equity tend to be reluctant to sell, even though their homes are often the most attractive to first-time buyers who might be ready to plunge into the market. "Sellers don't want to sell, even if buyers want to buy," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they do sell, prices are higher - which helps push values up. The process is actually moving the market toward recovery, but it's a gradual process, he said. "Over all, the second-quarter report is positive," said Mr. Humphries. "The housing market is healing, albeit slowly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These results come from the second edition of the new Zillow Negative Equity Report[http://www.zillow.com/blog/2012-08-22/negative-equity-falls-in-q2-half-of-borrowers-under-40-underwater/], which looks at current, outstanding loan amounts for individual, owner-occupied homes, and compares them to those homes' current estimated values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 30 largest markets tracked by Zillow, negative equity fell the most from the first to the second quarter in the Phoenix metropolitan area (from nearly 56 percent to about 52 percent) and the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area (from 46 percent to roughly 44 percent). The Las Vegas market continues to have the highest rate of negative equity, with nearly 69 percent of borrowers underwater (down from 71 percent in the first quarter.)</p>

</div><div class="author">By JULIE SATOW </div><div>1335 words</div><div>22 August 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Benchmark Real Estate Group acquired the 22-unit walk-up building at 156 Sullivan Street in SoHo for just over $6 million last year. It is now in contract to sell the rental building for $12.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we bought it, the rent rolls were about $300,000, but after renovating the apartments and pushing up rents, it is now generating $1 million,'' said Jordan D. Vogel, co-founder of the company with Aaron Feldman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benchmark is pursuing an increasingly popular strategy in New York City's investment sales market: the acquisition of small walk-up buildings across Manhattan. While walk-ups have never been the most glamorous buildings in the city, demand for and sales of these buildings have reached new highs recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 71 sales of walk-up buildings in Manhattan in the second quarter of this year, compared with just 33 in the second quarter of 2009, according to data from the brokerage firm Eastern Consolidated. In the first half of this year, sales volume for these multifamily properties reached nearly $640 million, a 205 percent increase from the $210 million reached in the first half of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The popularity and rising prices of walk-ups are owed in no small part to Manhattan's incredibly tight rental market. Rents have been surging for the last several years as New Yorkers remain skittish about buying homes and mortgages remain difficult to obtain. In June, for example, the average rent was $3,443 a month, according to Citi Habitats, the highest figure since the firm began tracking data in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With rents rising, the fact that many Manhattan walk-up buildings have tenants with rent-regulated apartments offers landlords the possibility of a very large increase in profits when these units are deregulated and shift to market rates. There is also upside potential to raise rents in the market rate units if landlords renovate a walk-up building, many of which have not been modernized in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about 40,000 rent-controlled and one million rent-stabilized units in New York City, with complex rules regulating them. In the case of rent stabilization, the leases can be renewed and the rent increased at a rate determined annually by the city's Rent Guidelines Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, rent-regulated apartments can be deregulated when a tenant dies, and landlords are not reluctant to gauge a building's prospects by taking note of tenants' ages, said Adelaide Polsinelli, a senior director at Eastern Consolidated. ''A landlord will look at a building and if it has, say, 100 units and 30 of them are occupied by tenants who are in their 50s or 60s, they know the end could be in sight,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders, who remain risk-averse in this economy, like buildings with rent-regulated units because ''the rents are already the worst-case scenario,'' Ms. Polsinelli said. She added that mortgage rates for these properties can be as low as 2.9 or 3 percent, compared with as much as 5 percent for offices and 8 percent for new development. She has brokered several of these deals in the last year, including last month, when she represented the seller of two five-story walk-up buildings at 521 and 523 East 12th Street for $10.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of Manhattan's walk-up buildings are also ripe for renovation, work that could allow for substantial rent increases, even among market rate apartments. The Silverstone Property Group, for example, recently acquired two buildings at 162 and 164 East 82nd Street and is completely renovating the common areas and the market rate units to increase the rent rolls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think that there are a lot of potential tenants who are coming out of high-end rental buildings with doormen and elevators that are looking for a similar feel but at a more affordable price,'' said Martin Nussbaum, the company's founder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To capture this market, Silverstone is renovating the 82nd Street buildings with marble tile, crown moldings, sophisticated intercom systems and amenities like a basement laundry room and gym. It is also upgrading plumbing and electrical work, and providing market rate units with stainless steel appliances and recessed lighting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is very capital-intensive for the first two years or so. Then, hopefully, we will see a significant increase in rent,'' Mr. Nussbaum said, adding that he acquires only buildings that have a minimum of 50 percent free-market apartments and where the leases are to expire within a year of acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason that investors like buying walk-up buildings is that they ''operate more efficiently and at a lower expense level than an elevator building, while the market rents are not that much less,'' said Peter Hauspurg, the chairman and chief executive of Eastern Consolidated. According to Citi Habitats, a one-bedroom in a walk-up building in Manhattan rented for an average of $2,602 in July, $366 less than a similar size unit in an elevator building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a walk-up can also be a better alternative than acquiring a small office building, Mr. Hauspurg said. In an office building, the landlord has to provide a new tenant with tenant improvement allowances, pay the brokerage fee, offer some free rent, ''and then if the small business went out of business, you have to replace the tenant with all the same expenditures,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a walk-up rental building, on the other hand, ''there is no brokerage fee because the tenant pays it and no down time because any apartment will rent within 30 days if it is priced right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But acquiring walk-up rentals in Manhattan can be very difficult right now because of fierce competition among buyers. ''I have toured 240 properties, made offers on 80 and bought only 16, so my batting average is terrible,'' Mr. Vogel said. ''Today there is a plethora of buyers, debt is at its all-time low in terms of rates and it is hard to find deals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Forrest, the chief executive of Forrest Partners, started his company in 2007 but has not made an acquisition since 2009. ''I was waiting to see if there was going to be any discounts or deals during the recession, but I never really saw pricing drop, so I sat on the sidelines,'' he said. ''I didn't want to be the guy who bought a property and six months later the prices bottom out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forrest Partners owns six buildings on the Lower East Side with a total of 100 apartments and nine stores, ''and if I want to buy more, I realize I'm going to have to pay up,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While interest rates are low, banks are requiring investors to put significant equity into deals. At 156 Sullivan Street, for example, Benchmark invested $8.2 million to acquire the building and complete the renovations, but the bank financed only $2.9 million of that total, Mr. Vogel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In 2007, you would have done that deal and put in just $500,000 of equity,'' he said, adding that in the three years since the company was founded, Benchmark has invested $75 million in equity to acquire and renovate its portfolio of 16 properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, investors are crowding into this market. ''It is an extension of the enormous capital that wants to be in Manhattan; I have never seen such a flood as in the last few years,'' said Mr. Hauspurg of Eastern Consolidated. ''Buying a walk-up building is a way for new investors to dip their toe in the pond without spending hundreds of millions of dollars and still get something with a lot of upside and not much downside.''</p>
