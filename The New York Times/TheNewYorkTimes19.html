<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the summer of 2007, Kirk Henckels, a broker of high-end homes, was crowing about the record-setting sales of trophy co-ops and town houses on the Upper East Side, with several sales topping $50 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said, ''$50 million is the new $30 million -- somehow $40 million was skipped.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Henckels, the director of private brokerage for Stribling &amp; Associates and the author of a report on the luxury market, says that in this economy deal-making at the upper end has all but come to a halt. Sellers are uncertain of the market, he said, and buyers are unwilling to commit to what could be seen as ostentatious purchases. Now $20 million is the new $40 million, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales under $5 million are continuing -- after all, people have to live somewhere -- with prices off about 15 percent, Mr. Henckels said. But at higher price points, there are so few sales that no one can gauge the loss in apartment and town house values. Inventories are rising but remain far below the levels of the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a long time, Mr. Henckels said, the luxury market supported the rest of the real estate market. Now ''it would be apparent that the lower end is supporting it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The trophy buyers are not in the market right now,'' he said. ''They are looking, but not buying.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This observation was confirmed by other brokers and a review of recent sales, though some brokers are more optimistic. In the last few weeks, after all, two full-floor apartments at 1030 Fifth Avenue at 96th Street, a luxurious building designed by J. E. R. Carpenter in 1924, sold in two separate transactions for a total of nearly $60 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it turns out that both of these sales were negotiated months ago, before the freezing of the trophy market. John Griffin, the founder and president of Blue Ridge Capital, who already lived in the building, bought a 10th-floor apartment for $32.25 million. And Bruce Wasserstein, the chairman of Lazard, the investment bank, sold an 11th-floor apartment for $27.5 million, according to property records. It had been the home of his former wife, Christine Wasserstein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 11th-floor apartment was listed at $34 million by Michelle Kleier of Gumley Haft Kleier, and went into contract in August for somewhat less than the asking price. But later, the buyer, Prakash A. Melwani, a senior managing director at the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, renegotiated a 19 percent discount, according to a broker briefed on the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kleier declined to comment but acknowledged that the market had slowed considerably over the ensuing months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been very quiet,'' she said. ''Quieter than normal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say only a handful of deals have gone into contract for more than $8 million since October, while most of the closings in that price range have been for properties that went into contract many months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while sales of lower-priced co-ops have fallen, too, sales of higher-priced co-ops, those costing more than $1 million, have fallen at a faster rate in the last few months, according to city property records.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MUMBAI</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What has taken a number of us by surprise is the lack of adequate supervision and regulation,'' Rana Kapoor was saying the other day. ''This was despite the fact that Enron had happened and you passed Sarbanes-Oxley. We don't understand it. Maybe it's because we sit in a more controlled economy but ....'' He smiled sweetly as his voice trailed off, as if to take the sting off his comments. But they stung nonetheless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kapoor is an Indian banker, a former longtime <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> executive with a Rutgers M.B.A. who, along with his business partner and brother-in-law, Ashok Kapur, was granted government permission four years ago to start a private bank, which they called Yes Bank. In the United States, Yes Bank is the kind of name a go-go banker might give to, say, a high-flying mortgage lender in the middle of a bubble. (You can even imagine the slogan: ''Yes is part of our name!'') But Yes Bank is not exactly the <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span> of India. One news release it hands out to reporters who come calling is an excerpt from a 2007 survey by The Financial Express: ''#1 on Credit Quality amongst 56 Banks in India,'' reads the headline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I arrived in Mumbai three weeks after the terrorist attacks that killed 200 people -- including, tragically, Yes Bank's co-founder Mr. Kapur, who had served as the company's nonexecutive chairman and was gunned down while having dinner at the Oberoi Hotel. (His wife and two dinner companions miraculously escaped.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My hope in traveling to Mumbai was to learn about the current state of Indian business in the wake of both the credit crisis and the attacks. But in my first few days in this grand, sprawling, chaotic city, what I mainly heard, especially talking to bankers, was about America, not India. How could we have brought so much trouble on ourselves, and the rest of the world, by acting in such an obviously foolhardy manner? Didn't we understand that you can't lend money to people who lack the means to pay it back? The questions were asked with a sense of bewilderment -- and an occasional hint of scorn. Like most Americans, I didn't have any good answers. It was a bubble, I would respond with a sheepish shrug, as if that were an adequate explanation. It isn't, of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In India, we never had anything close to the subprime loan,'' said Chandra Kochhar, the chief financial officer of India's largest private bank, Icici. (A few days after I spoke to her, Ms. Kochhar was named the bank's new chief executive, in a move that had long been anticipated.) ''All lending to individuals is based on their income. That is a big difference between your banking system and ours.'' She continued: ''Indian banks are not levered like American banks. Capital ratios are 12 and 13 percent, instead of 7 or 8 percent. All those exotic structures like C.D.O. and securitizations are a very tiny part of our banking system. So a lot of the temptations didn't exist.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when I went to see Deepak Parekh, the chief executive of HDFC, which was founded in 1977 as the country's first specialized mortgage bank, practically the first words out of his mouth were these: ''We don't do interest-only or subprime loans. When the bubble was going on, we did not change any of our policies. We did not change any of our systems. We did not change our thought process. We never gave more money to a borrower because the value of the house had gone up. Citibank has a few home equity loans, but most banks in India don't make those kinds of loans. Our nonperforming loans are less than 1 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet two years ago, the Indian real estate market -- commercial and residential alike -- was every bit as frothy as the American market. High-rises were being slapped up on spec. Housing developments were sprouting up everywhere. And there was plenty of money flowing into India, mainly from private equity and hedge funds, to fuel the commercial real estate bubble in particular. <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, Carlyle, Blackstone, Citibank -- they were all here, throwing money at developers. So why did the Indian banks stay on the sidelines and avoid most of the pain that has been suffered by the big American banks?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the reason is cultural. Indians are simply not as comfortable with credit as Americans. ''A lot of Indians, when you push them, will say that if you spend more than you earn you will get in trouble,'' an Indian consultant told me. ''Americans spent more than they earned.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parekh said, ''Savings are important. Joint families exist. When one son moves out, the family helps them. So you don't borrow so much from the bank.'' Even mortgage loans tend to have down payments in India that are a third of the purchase price, a far cry from the United States, where 20 percent is the new norm. (Let's not even think about what they used to be.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was also another factor, perhaps the most important of all. India had a bank regulator who was the anti-Greenspan. His name was Dr. Y. V. Reddy, and he was the governor of the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of India</span>. Seventy percent of the banking system in India is nationalized, so a strong regulator is critical, since any banking scandal amounts to a national political scandal as well. And in the irascible Mr. Reddy, who took office in 2003 and stepped down this past September, it had exactly the right man in the right job at the right time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He basically believed that if bankers were given the opportunity to sin, they would sin,'' said one banker who asked not to be named because, well, there's not much percentage in getting on the wrong side of the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of India</span>. For all the bankers' talk about their higher lending standards, the truth is that Mr. Reddy made them even more stringent during the bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike Alan Greenspan, who didn't believe it was his job to even point out bubbles, much less try to deflate them, Mr. Reddy saw his job as making sure Indian banks did not get too caught up in the bubble mentality. About two years ago, he started sensing that real estate, in particular, had entered bubble territory. One of the first moves he made was to ban the use of bank loans for the purchase of raw land, which was skyrocketing. Only when the developer was about to commence building could the bank get involved -- and then only to make construction loans. (Guess who wound up financing the land purchases? United States private equity and hedge funds, of course!)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, as securitizations and derivatives gained increasing prominence in the world's financial system, the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of India</span> sharply curtailed their use in the country. When Mr. Reddy saw American banks setting up off-balance-sheet vehicles to hide debt, he essentially banned them in India. As a result, banks in India wound up holding onto the loans they made to customers. On the one hand, this meant they made fewer loans than their American counterparts because they couldn't sell off the loans to Wall Street in securitizations. On the other hand, it meant they still had the incentive -- as American banks did not -- to see those loans paid back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing inflation on the horizon, Mr. Reddy pushed interest rates up to more than 20 percent, which of course dampened the housing frenzy. He increased risk weightings on commercial buildings and shopping mall construction, doubling the amount of capital banks were required to hold in reserve in case things went awry. He made banks put aside extra capital for every loan they made. In effect, Mr. Reddy was creating liquidity even before there was a global liquidity crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did India's bankers stand up to applaud Mr. Reddy as he was making these moves? Of course not. They were naturally furious, just as American bankers would have been if Mr. Greenspan had been more active. Their regulator was holding them back, constraining their growth! Mr. Parekh told me that while he had been saying for some time that Indian real estate was in bubble territory, he was still unhappy with the rules imposed by Mr. Reddy. ''We were critical of the central bank,'' he said. ''We thought these were harsh measures.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For a while we were wondering if we were missing out on something,'' said Ms. Kochhar of Icici. Banks in the United States seemed to have come up with some magical new formula for making money: make loans that required no down payment and little in the way of verification -- and post instant, short-term, profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Luis Miranda, who runs a private equity firm devoted to developing India's infrastructure, put it: ''We kept wondering if they had figured out something that we were too dense to figure out. It looked like they were smart and we were stupid.'' Instead, India was the smart one, and we were the stupid ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kochhar said that the underlying risks of having ''a majority of loans not owned by the people who originated them'' was not apparent during the bubble. Now that those risks have been made painfully clear, every banker in India realizes that Mr. Reddy did the right thing by limiting securitizations. ''At times like this, you tend to appreciate what he did more than we did at the time,'' said Mr. Kapoor. ''He saved us,'' added Mr. Parekh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the credit crisis has spread these past months, no Indian bank has come close to failing the way so many United States and European financial institutions have. None have required the kind of emergency injections of capital that Western banks have needed. None have had the huge write-downs that were par for the course in the West. As the bubble has burst, which lenders have taken the hit? Why, the private equity and hedge fund lenders who had been so eager to finance land development. Us, in others words, rather than them. Why is that not a surprise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I asked Mr. Kapoor for his take on what had happened in the United States, he replied: ''We recognize it as a problem of plenty. It was perpetuated by greedy bankers, whether investment bankers or commercial bankers. The greed to make money is the impression it has made here. Anytime they wanted a loan, people just dipped into their home A.T.M. It was like money was on call.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it was. And our regulators, unlike theirs, just stood by and let it happen. The next time we're moving into bubble territory, perhaps we can take a page from Mr. Reddy's book -- sometimes it's better to apply the brakes too early than too late. Or, as was the case with Mr. Greenspan, not at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this is to say that the global credit crisis hasn't affected India. It certainly has. I'll be back after the holidays with more columns from India, including how Sept. 15 -- the day <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> defaulted -- changed everything, even here, on the other side of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: December 23, 2008, Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Talking Business column on Saturday, about India's avoiding the subprime lending crisis, reversed the initials of a former governor of the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of India</span>, whose policies helped hold bankers to high lending standards. He is Y. V. Reddy. The error also appeared in an accompanying caption.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The construction of new homes plummeted in November by the largest amount in almost a quarter-century as builders slashed production in the face of a recessionary economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Tuesday that new home starts fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 625,000 from a downwardly revised level of 771,000 in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a drop of 18.9 percent, the steepest since March 1984. The total is far below the 740,000 pace that Wall Street economists expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for building permits, considered a good sign of future activity, fell by 15.6 percent to 616,000, from an upwardly revised figure of 730,000 in October. Economists expected an annual rate of 700,000 permits, according to a survey by ThomsonReuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing starts and permit figures are at all-time lows, breaking records that were set last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders continue to be discouraged by the prospects of a housing turnaround amid what's likely to be the worst recession in decades, spurring rising unemployment and foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More dour housing news came Monday, as the National Association of Home Builders/<span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> housing market index held at a record-low level of nine in December for the second straight month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is going to be a very cold winter indeed for homebuilders,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist for forecasting firm MFR Inc., wrote in a note to clients Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Index readings higher than 50 indicate positive sentiment about the market. But the index has drifted below 50 since May 2006 and has been below 20 since April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders began new single-family homes at an annual rate of 441,000 last month, the department said, 16.9 percent below October's figure of 531,000. That is the steepest drop in single-family home starts since January 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tighter lending standards, rising defaults and fear about the housing market's future have sidelined buyers, an absence felt acutely by homebuilders such as <span class="companylink">D.R.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices fell at the fastest rate on record in November, while home construction skidded nearly 20 percent to its lowest levels in 50 years, according to government data released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new reports offered further evidence of the ''weaker prospects for economic activity'' cited by the Federal Reserve as it cut its target overnight interest rate to a range of zero to 0.25 percentage points, a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department reported that consumer prices fell for the second consecutive month, at the fastest rate since the government began keeping track in 1947.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices at cash registers and gas pumps across the country were a seasonally adjusted 1.7 percent lower in November from the month before, led downward by a 17 percent decline in energy prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core rate of inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, was flat for the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of gasoline plunged 29.5 percent while the cost of fuel oil fell 13.6 percent. Food and beverage prices crept up 0.2 percent in November, their slowest rate of growth all year, while clothing prices were up 0.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unadjusted year-over-year inflation rate was 1.1 percent, the government reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've never seen the economy slam on the brakes as much as it has in the last three months,'' said Bill Hampel, chief economist at the Credit Union National Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, new data showed the nation's housing market continuing to lag. The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell to a seasonally adjusted 625,000 in November, far below Wall Street's expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing starts in November represented an 18.9 percent decline from the previous month and were 47 percent lower than November 2007. New-home construction in October was revised downward to 771,000 units from an earlier estimate of 791,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is mind-bogglingly awful,'' Ian Shepherdson, United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note. ''The only consolation here is that unless sales drop much further from their already fantastically depressed level, the pace of new construction is so low that inventory will fall quickly. Right now, though, housing is still a disaster area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, a measure of future construction, also fell sharply in November, dropping by 15.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted 616,000.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">A Year of Tumult For REITs</span>
</div><div class="author">By VIVIAN MARINO   </div><div>1385 words</div><div>14 December 2008</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A MAIN benefit for those who own real estate investment trusts has been their low historical correlation to the rest of the financial markets. In other words, REITs have tended not to move in tandem with most stocks and bonds, thus making them good portfolio diversifiers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of that seemed to change this year amid the deepening credit crisis and Wall Street's meltdown. Just as stocks fell fast and furiously, so, too, did most REIT shares. (And at those times when stocks were rallying back, REITs also moved higher.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The REIT market is now poised to end 2008 with big losses. This year through Thursday, the index of equity REITs, which own commercial property and constitute the bulk of the market, was down 49.16 percent according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. (Losses for mortgage REITs, which originate loans and invest in mortgage-backed securities, averaged 42.16 percent.) The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index has skidded 40.1 percent so far in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REIT shares, meanwhile, are trading at deep discounts to the value of the assets they hold -- which may lead some investors to wonder whether now is the time to start buying again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to estimates last week by Green Street Advisors, a research firm that tracks real estate securities, REITs are trading at about a 30 percent discount to net asset value, on average. That number is similar to the level in late 1990, but considerably higher than it was last month, when the discount reached an unprecedented 47 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mike Kirby, the director of research for Green Street, issued a caution about the numbers, noting that it was harder than usual to establish a REIT's net asset value, which represents what a company would fetch for the properties it owns if it sold them today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Real estate transactions have dried up, so there are no recent comparisons,'' he said. ''They're based on a guess right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has been a second consecutive year of losses for REITs -- in 2007, they fell nearly 16 percent. The declines show a continued reversal of fortunes for an asset class that not long ago was considered a darling of Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, REITs outperformed the overall stock market for several years, providing average annualized returns of 23.6 percent from November 1999 through January 2007, according to the REIT association. ''It just seems like everything has been pulled down,'' said Greg Sukenik, a senior analyst covering the REIT market for Zacks Investment Research, describing the current investment climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gun-shy investors, it seemed, saw little difference in stocks or REITs; some remain reluctant to put their money into anything these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Case, vice president for research and industry information at the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, agreed that REITs have been moving more in lock step with the rest of the financial markets, but says that this has been only a recent change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He described the 2008 performance of REITs as akin to having two separate markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first nine months were largely a normal market,'' he said, noting that equity REITs actually gained 6.6 percent from the end of February through September. But by end of November, he said, the market was down 58 percent from its peak in January 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All REIT property types have been hit hard. This year through Thursday, the industrial sector was down a staggering 81.11 percent; lodging and resorts dropped 66.57 percent; and regional shopping malls were off 66.34 percent. The best performer -- that is, the sector with the smallest losses -- was self-storage, down 14.59 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A DRIVING force behind the market's dismal performance has been rising debt levels in many REITs. ''They took advantage of all the cheap credit that was once available and overextended themselves, often buying overvalued properties using excessive leverage,'' said Joel R. Bloomer, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, the market research company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the debt comes due, some of these companies face potential headaches. Refinancing may be tricky under the tight credit environment, just as raising money through equity offerings would be during a bear market. At the same time, REITs have been contending with falling real estate values, so selling property to raise capital may also be hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than ever, investors are paying closer attention to REIT balance sheets, in addition to management experience. ''You want companies with good cash flow,'' Mr. Sukenik said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help conserve cash, or because profits are falling, some REITs have trimmed back dividends -- the one feature that makes their shares especially attractive to income-seeking investors. REITs are required to disburse at least 90 percent of their taxable income to shareholders, in exchange for favorable tax treatment. (Many REITs typically distribute more than 90 percent, according to the trade group.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul E. Adornato, a senior REIT analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said that nearly a quarter of the 99 equity REITs covered by his firm have cut or suspended dividends, with most of those changes occurring in the last two months. They include companies in a wide range of sectors -- among them <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties</span>, which focuses on shopping centers; Felcor Lodging, hotels; <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> Trust, warehouses; and Post Properties, apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sukenik of Zacks Investment said, ''Companies that pose the highest risk have high near-term debt maturities, constrained liquidity, and problems covering the dividend.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet he and other analysts still see a few bright spots, not to mention value from the market's precipitous drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On many analysts' list of favorites is <span class="companylink">Public Storage Inc</span>., which operates self-storage centers nationwide and is the reason, some say, for the sector's comparatively better performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's unique about Public Storage is that it has no debt -- they have a fair amount of preferred stock but no debt,'' Mr. Kirby said. ''The best REITs out there are not going to be deploying capital over the next year but preserving all the capital they can.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that reason, Mr. Sukenik favors the so-called blue-chip REITs ''with geographic diversification and plenty of balance-sheet flexibility who can better withstand the expected economic downturn, which will continue well into 2009.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, he likes <span class="companylink">Equity Residential Properties Trust</span>, which he called a bellwether apartment REIT, in part because it has a healthy cash reserve and available line of credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think apartments will perform better than other sectors, particularly retail and office, in 2009 due to the continued housing slowdown which creates a larger pool of renters,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Adornato, meanwhile, preferred <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span>, which develops and manages luxury apartments, mainly on the East and West Coasts, and <span class="companylink">Douglas Emmett Inc</span>., which owns apartments, along with office space, in California and Hawaii.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They operate in high-barrier-to-entry markets,'' he said, where there are often obstacles to construction, like strict zoning limitations or community resistance to new developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sukenik was also positive about the health care sector, which holds properties like hospitals and medical office buildings. ''People still spend money on health care, even in this environment,'' he noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among his choices was <span class="companylink">HCP Inc</span>., which he says ''has done a successful job of delivering after heavy acquisition activity in 2007.'' In addition, he said, ''the company has about $1.5 billion of cash and credit availability.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Bloomer of Morningstar said he had a negative outlook on the entire REIT market, he did prefer some companies over others in certain sectors -- like the <span class="companylink">AMB Property Corporation</span> over <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here are two very similar companies where management went down two different paths -- <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> took full advantage of loose credit and borrowed and bought at a rapid pace, but AMB didn't,'' he said. ''Yet its stock has sold off nearly as much as <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span>.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN sales began almost two years ago at the first Northside Piers tower in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, buyers snapped up more than 20 percent of the 180 luxury condominiums in the first two months. They may have been drawn by the sweeping East River vistas and myriad amenities like valet parking and rooftop cabanas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then came the credit crisis and the meltdown on Wall Street. Sales traffic inside the 29-story glass building began to slow down, and today about a third of the condos remain unsold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with the prospect of empty units and static cash flow, just as sales were starting on an even larger sister tower -- Two Northside Piers -- the developer, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, decided to take a different approach and expand a program used elsewhere in the country that allows prospective owners to lease with the option to buy, using part of the rent toward the purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rent-to-own options, which come in many variations, have become increasingly common for developers in areas where home foreclosures are high, like Nevada, California and Florida. In most cases, the accumulated rent is used to lower the purchase price or to reduce closing costs. (<span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> guidelines generally preclude using rent money toward the down payment, mortgage experts say, because buyers need to prove that they can save on their own and thus qualify for a loan.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective buyers at Northside Piers tower are essentially able to try out certain one- to three-bedroom apartments. If they like what they see, they can purchase them later on. Or, once the lease is up, they can simply walk away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's really experimental, but all indications so far are good,'' said David Von Spreckelsen, a senior vice president of <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> City Living, a division of <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>. Two families have signed up for the rent-to-own program since it began this fall, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last several months, as residential sales have softened in the city and throughout the region, other developments (many in parts of Brooklyn that are rife with new construction), have been offering similar deals, as have a smattering of motivated individual sellers. Some are finding help through Web sites devoted to such listings, like iRentToOwn.com -- which, according to its founder, John Kobs, has had 4.4 million page views since its inception a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, real estate brokers have been revamping their approaches to marketing hard-to-move property to include renting with an option to buy (a k a lease purchase or lease option).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fliers and promotional material inviting people to ''test drive'' homes and neighborhoods can be found on buildings in Manhattan, including Sutton Manor on East 53rd Street, 99 John Street, the Revere on East 54th Street and Morgan Court on Madison Avenue. In Brooklyn, the BridgeView Tower and the Decora are among those with this option, in addition to Northside Piers. Both sale prices and rents are often included in the listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rent-to-own concept represents ''a change in mind-set'' during these tough economic times, said Jonathan J. Miller, a founder and the president of the Miller Samuel real estate appraisal firm. ''The longer this drags out, the more acceptable this option becomes; this is just evolving,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time lease-purchase options were seen with any frequency in the New York area was in the late '80s and early '90s -- a time when market conditions may have been even more dire than they are now, according to veteran real estate professionals, and certainly a time when interest rates were a lot higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That period of time was a very severe downturn,'' Mr. Miller said. ''The market had about seven years of surplus inventory to be absorbed. In the period we're in now, we have 7.9 months of inventory. We're clearly going into a weak economic period but going into it with relative strength.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Klara Madlin, the owner of Klara Madlin Real Estate in Manhattan, offered similar observations, and recalled handling a few lease-purchase deals in those dicey decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How many of these lessees ultimately bought their apartments back then? ''I would say maybe 5 percent -- not a lot,'' Ms. Madlin said, noting that hard numbers are difficult to come by. Conversion rates were low, she said, ''because the people generally who were renting to buy couldn't really afford to buy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it might be different this time around,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting to own can be attractive for both sides of a real estate transaction. It brings cash flow to properties that otherwise might be stagnant. And buyers lacking adequate down payments (perhaps because of stock losses), struggling with poor credit, or even recovering from a recent foreclosure, can build up savings and rebuild creditworthiness in order to get a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Simon Hall, a 40-year-old technology specialist from Britain, it is a means of establishing a credit history in this country and paving the path to eventual homeownership for himself and his American girlfriend, Vishma Victor, 28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even though I have excellent credit in the U.K., it makes no difference in the U.S.,'' Mr. Hall said, adding that ''eventually I will have rental history and utility bill history. ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the summer, before the birth of their daughter, India, the couple signed a one-year lease option on a 1,200-square-foot two-bedroom at the BridgeView Tower Condominiums near Dumbo, Brooklyn. If they agree to buy before the lease expires, he said, their $4,000 monthly rent (minus maintenance costs) will go toward the purchase of the unit, which has a current asking price of around $980,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael D. Mancuso, 29, a salesman, and Danielle J. Gendler, 26, an events and marketing manager, were not necessarily concerned about their creditworthiness, but they wanted extra time to save up for a larger down payment. In October, they signed a similar lease-purchase agreement for two years on a one-bedroom at BridgeView Tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we get most of the rent that we paid back, I'm pretty much living in Brooklyn for the next two years for nothing,'' Mr. Mancuso said. By his calculations, 83 percent of the $3,000 in monthly rent will go toward the purchase, which means the $550,000 apartment will cost them around $490,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It buys a little time for everyone,'' said Scott Domansky, a principal of PRD Realty, the developer of the Heritage at Park Slope in Brooklyn, a 21-unit condominium, which last month began offering rent-to-own options on six unsold units. (So far no takers, he says, though he is in negotiations with interested parties.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't think this would be an option a year ago,'' Mr. Domansky said. ''The market was still strong -- apartments were selling at such a rapid rate that I thought I would be sold out. But I'm happy to have renters and monthly income in lieu of a sale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Murdock, a 33-year-old part-time disc jockey and technology consultant, is hoping that will happen for him. During the height of the real estate market, he bought several investment properties -- including two in Jamaica, Queens -- and now needs to sell them. He already lost one home, in Atlanta, to foreclosure, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've had interest from people who wanted to purchase, but they couldn't get a mortgage,'' said Mr. Murdock, who recently moved to Charlotte, N.C., from Freeport on Long Island, and still needs to sell his house there as well. Allowing would-be buyers to lease first and use an as-yet-undetermined amount of rent toward the purchase ''gives the buyers time to save up,'' he said. It also shows him that they are qualified to buy eventually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers are even executing lease-purchase agreements in co-op buildings, though mostly, they say, as a last resort. (Most co-ops, however, restrict rentals.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen Kelley, a broker at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said she had recently completed such a deal on a prewar three-bedroom on the Upper West Side. The place was listed for six months and the owners had to relocate to Atlanta, she explained. Meanwhile, Jill Sloane, a broker with Halstead Property, says her listings include two co-ops for rent with an option to buy; both had been previously listed for sale and are now vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say they believe that more people are qualified to buy than are actually buying; many may be sidelined because they are waiting for home prices to reach their nadir or for the credit markets to loosen up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People really do want to buy -- they look at New York real estate as a valuable commodity over time,'' said Reba P. Miller, the president of R. P. Miller &amp; Associates and the sales agent for Morgan Court in Murray Hill, which has about a dozen sponsor units available for rent with an option to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Tong, the developer of the BridgeView Tower in Brooklyn, said that an infusion of federal money into the banking system should eventually help business. Last month, the Federal Reserve and Treasury announced $800 billion in new lending programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Mr. Tong seems to be doing all he can to spur sales himself, even bringing in as a consultant a mortgage specialist, Debra Bock of Stanley Capital Mortgage, to counsel prospective buyers so that they can qualify for a loan. ''About a third are having trouble,'' Mr. Tong said. ''But I would say that 100 percent of them would be able to buy in three to six months.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those leasing at Northside Piers in Williamsburg, as in other developments, must be prequalified by a mortgage company in order to buy a unit; prices range from $700,000 for a one-bedroom to $1.1 million for a three-bedroom. According to Mr. Von Spreckelsen, the <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> senior vice president, renters have six months to commit to buying if they expect to use all of their rent toward the purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After six months it trails off -- they lose a month for each month they delay,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jill Vegas, 37, an interior decorator and stager, and her husband, Michael Zimberg, 35, a director at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>, a bank, have been mulling over that offer since their lease option at Northside Piers began in October. The couple have been eager to get back into the New York market, having rented since they sold their Upper West Side apartment at the peak around four years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet while they are not necessarily concerned about qualifying for a mortgage, they are wary of the market and wonder how long it may take before all of its problems are sorted out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think this building may hold its value,'' Ms. Vegas said, ''and when I look out the windows of my two-bedroom apartment I see beautiful, unobstructed views from the 23rd floor. But when I look down, I can count on every single block how many new developments are coming up and see thousands of new units, and that worries me.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAMELA LIEBMAN, the president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, has been visiting Corcoran offices around town, rallying the troops and offering advice to young brokers on how to adapt and thrive in a real estate downturn. But some brokers are finding that even in a troubled market, deals sometimes fall into place, just as in the old days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what seems to have happened when a five-year-old triplex apartment at 95 Charles Street in the West Village with obvious curb appeal -- a 38-foot-wide yard, a double-height glass-walled living room with Venetian plaster walls -- went on the market recently for $8.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the first day of the listing, the first buyer who saw it was interested, and the second made an offer at about the asking price -- and a deal was struck. The property was in contract in 11 days, according to listing information at Streeteasy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing by Miep Van den Hoven, of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, shows bookcases that extend nearly to a 20-foot ceiling and a sprawling tree-lined rear yard with a Cycladic stone patio. The apartment, in a building with only five owners, has seven rooms, including three bedrooms, and extends over about 4,000 square feet, not counting the 1,350-square-foot garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellers, according to city property records, are Christopher D. McFadden, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, and his wife, Mary. They bought the apartment in October 2003 for just over $3 million. The buyer, represented by Christopher Leavitt, a Corcoran broker, is also said to be in finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Van den Hoven observed that with the right buyer and the right seller, brokers can still make deals, especially when they are handed a ''spectacular property.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But given the rocky real estate market, Ms. Van den Hoven and Mr. Leavitt soon became concerned that too much publicity before the closing might jinx the sale, and they declined to comment further until the closing.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVEN though the average price for a Manhattan apartment, at $1.5 million, is higher than it was a year ago, some New York neighborhoods have already started to feel the downward tug that has wrenched the housing market elsewhere in the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices in Harlem and East Harlem were down nearly 20 percent, to $440,000 at the end of this year's third quarter, from $549,000 at the same time last year, according to data from Miller Samuel Inc., a real estate appraisal and consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, condominiums in Midtown East and Turtle Bay dropped 18.6 percent, to $1.197 million from $1.47 million; and condos in Midtown West and Hell's Kitchen dropped 8 percent, to $1.01 million from $1.099 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''None of that surprises me because those are the fringe areas that are going through change,'' said Michael Signet, the executive director of sales at Bond New York, a real estate agency. Whenever there's a slowdown, he said, those are the first places to get hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another sign that the market has slowed significantly is the marked drop in sales, decreasing 24 percent in Manhattan, to 2,654 in the three months that ended on Sept. 30, from 3,499 in the third quarter of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit crisis and the volatility on Wall Street will probably spur a continuation of these trends and lead to a universal drop in housing prices, Mr. Signet said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From everything we're seeing out on the street, the fourth quarter report will slow prices down across the board in every neighborhood,'' Mr. Signet said. ''There's a lot of nervousness out there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, agreed that the weakness in the housing market is likely to continue and spread, especially because banks have made it so difficult for buyers to get mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Until the financial markets are stabilized and mortgages are more readily available and more affordable to consumers,'' he said, ''you're going to see an across-the-board impact on the market and it will affect all demographics.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As to whether the neighborhoods that have softened first will weaken more quickly, Mr. Miller said: ''Emerging neighborhoods by definition are more volatile. They have more potential to decline when the market weakens, and conversely they have more potential upside when the market returns.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other neighborhoods that experienced price drops include the Lower East Side and the East Village, where median prices fell 5.5 percent; and Carnegie Hill, where co-op prices decreased 7.2 percent. Median prices in Hamilton Heights and Morningside Heights dropped 30 percent, with sales decreasing to only 19 from 67 in 2007. In Washington Heights, median prices went down 6.3 percent, but the number of sales increased to 24 from 18 in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhoods that fared the best through the third quarter included Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue from 59th to 96th Streets, where median prices went up 35 percent. In Lincoln Square, an area between 57th and 72nd Streets from Central Park West to the Hudson River that is home to high-priced apartments in 15 Central Park West and the <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center, median co-op prices went up 18.6 percent and median condo prices went up 25 percent. Prices also rose in Lenox Hill, where median co-op prices went up 19 percent; and Chelsea, where median co-op and condo prices went up about 6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other neighborhoods that experienced increases include Greenwich Village, where median prices for co-ops went up 3.9 percent; Union Square and the Gramercy area, where co-op prices went up 3.3 percent and condo prices went up 2.6 percent; and the Upper East Side, where median co-op prices went up 2.3 percent and condo prices went up 9.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were also up in Battery Park City and Inwood, two neighborhoods where sales volume was relatively low. In Battery Park City, the median price rose 6.5 percent and number of sales held steady, going from 31 to 30. In Inwood, prices increased 17.1 percent, but sales dropped to 12 from 26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers agree that in September after the collapse of several Wall Street brokerage firms and throughout October, many buyers simply opted out of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A little more than a year ago, real estate agents worried about how to handle the dozens of people who showed up at open houses. Today, agents are pleased when a sign-in sheet logs six names, because it beats having no one show up at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things have been at a standstill in the last couple weeks,'' said Janice Silver, the manager of Bellmarc Realty's East Side office. ''With the markets crashing, people have been seeing their money go away, and they're thinking twice about buying a sweater, let alone an apartment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Harlem, the median sales price for co-ops and condos dropped nearly 20 percent, and the number of sales in the third quarter dropped from 160 in 2007 to 100 this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The number of transactions in Harlem is definitely down,'' said Jorden Tepper, the director of sales at Century 21 NY Metro. ''And in terms of what is selling, we're specifically seeing more interest in the lower end and not in the higher-end luxury-priced units.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size of the average apartment sold in Harlem bears that out. It was 744 square feet in the latest quarter, down from 1,011 square feet in the third quarter of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veronica Raehse, the sales manager for the West Side office of Bellmarc, said that while she had seen a softening of the market across the West Side, Harlem had been hit the hardest. She said that after six weeks of very little activity, things had started to pick up in the last week of October. ''But it's all low-end stuff, and at this point, anything over $500,000 is high-end already,'' and not moving, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and other brokers said that they had been advising sellers to price their apartments 10 to 15 percent below the latest comparable sales. ''You have to use comps as a starting point and price down from there,'' she said. ''It's the only way to get more activity, because if buyers don't think a deal is being offered, they're just not going to bother with it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald Kemper, a vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, agreed that the only way to be a successful seller in the current market is to set a competitive price. ''You have to establish value right away,'' he said. ''Because nobody wants to buy now and find that they could get it for less next year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kemper specializes in Midtown West and Hell's Kitchen, where median prices on co-ops went down 10.8 percent, to $540,000, and median prices on condos went down 8 percent, to $1.01 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that the area has changed rapidly in recent years, and that condo prices there had been driven up by the new construction along the 42nd Street corridor on the Far West Side. He said that until this year, many buyers came to the area ''with a very definite desire to be in Hell's Kitchen, because it was more affordable and because Chelsea and other neighborhoods were out of reach for them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because prices are softening around the city, he said, buyers are less focused on Hell's Kitchen, ''maybe because they can find opportunity elsewhere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Silver said that Midtown East and Turtle Bay, an area delineated as from 42nd to 59th Street and from the Avenue of the Americas to the East River, seems to be experiencing a similar trend. While not an emerging neighborhood, it often has volatile prices, especially in the eastern stretches farthest from the subway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's one of those areas where if you live there, you realize it's convenient and it's a fine place to live,'' Ms. Silver said, ''but it's not the kind of place where people say they're dying to live.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices for condos in the area dropped 18.6 percent, and the number of sales decreased to 126 in the latest quarter, compared with 158 in the third quarter of 2007. But median co-op prices actually rose by 12 percent, to $690,108 from $615,000 in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said that those numbers were distorted by a huge drop in activity. The number of co-op sales declined 36 percent, to 117 last quarter, from 184 in the third quarter of 2007. He said that the median price may have skewed up because the apartments that sold were higher-priced ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Financial District is one emerging neighborhood where reality seems to contradict what the third-quarter numbers would suggest. Brokers agree that sales have slowed in recent weeks and that buyers can expect to get some good deals there right now, but the median price for condos actually rose by 5 percent, to $940,000, in this year's third quarter, compared with last year's $895,000. Co-op prices dropped 19 percent, but the neighborhood has very few co-ops; the number of sales fell to 6 from 11 in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller says the numbers are deceptive mainly because there has been so much construction in the area. ''New construction will skew prices higher,'' he said, adding that in most of the deals that closed recently, buyers probably signed the contracts 12 to 18 months ago. ''The closings are delayed, so they're more reflective of a prior period when the market was stronger.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For people looking to buy in a new development right now, Yvonne DeNigris, an agent with <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, said: ''I think the most substantial flexibility is in the Financial District, because it's so developed now and there's not the strongest demand for it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SoHo and TriBeCa and the co-op market on the Upper West Side are areas where median prices dropped, but the volume of sales nonetheless remained strong, leading brokers to infer that the lower prices do not reflect what's happening in these markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In SoHo and TriBeCa, which Miller Samuel combines and maps from Houston Street south to Vesey Street and from Broadway to the Hudson River, the median price for co-ops in the third quarter dropped 6.1 percent, to $1.925 million from $2.05 million in 2007; and the median price for condos dropped 28.5 percent, to $1.9 million from $2.65 million. But the number of sales for co-ops and condos rose to 166 from 98.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cornelia Dobrovolsky, a senior vice president with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said that last year's median price had probably been skewed up by the closings of very high-end condos in 2007. Several apartments sold last year at 40 Mercer Street for $5 million to $10 million. ''And those are very big numbers for SoHo because you don't have a lot of luxury loft buildings,'' she said. ''I really have not seen a drop in actual values between this year and last.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said, though, that a shift had occurred in recent weeks, and that she had seen some price reductions. ''There certainly have been fewer sales since the summer, so that's got to have some impact for the next quarter's numbers,'' Ms. Dobrovolsky said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Upper West Side, the median price for co-ops dropped 13.3 percent in the third quarter, but the median prices for condos went up 29.5 percent. The volume of sales for all Upper West Side apartments decreased 7.5 percent, to 577 from 624.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the drop in the median price of co-ops to $650,000 from $750,000 is at least partially attributable to the fact that the average size of sold apartments also decreased, to 907 square feet from 1,142 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffery Sholeen, a senior vice president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said he found it hard to believe that co-op prices had dropped that much. ''It could be that large apartments in co-ops weren't selling or they weren't available,'' he said. ''But there's still big demand for larger units on the Upper West Side.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the new developments on the Upper West Side have successfully sold three- and four-bedroom apartments, he said, which might account for the big jump in the median sales price for condos, going to $1.425 million from $1.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Sholeen and other agents said that activity in the fourth quarter would definitely be down from last year because many people had decided to take their properties off the market in the wake of the turmoil in the financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people also said they wanted to wait to do anything until after the election, regardless of the outcome,'' Mr. Sholeen said. ''There was a lot of anxiety before it happened and people's attention was focused on that and nothing else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now that it's over, agents say they're hopeful that buyers and sellers will refocus their attention on real estate.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MORE than 70 years ago Ernie Pyle, in his itinerant-travel-writer phase, traveled to Ohio's Lake Erie shore and wrote about a village on South Bass Island called Put-in-Bay. Caribbean-style cruise ships plied the Great Lakes then, and Put-in-Bay was a favored, and lively, stop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Put-in-Bay is the capital, you might say, of the Lake Erie islands,'' Pyle wrote before adding, ''Put-in-Bay lives off wine and summer excursionists.'' Save for a few details, Pyle got it right -- then and now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days Put-in-Bay has the rowdy, tank-top informality of Key West, Fla., with golf carts, and includes energetic game fishing, striking over-the-water sunsets -- and mixed drinks in place of the wine noted by Pyle. Local residents largely steer clear of the village, and repair to cool inland cottages and lakeside retreats where stick-built, three-room affairs rub architectural elbows with mini-mansions of more recent vintage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's kind of a slice that's frozen in time,'' said Charles Lowe, 79, who drove a 1930 Model-A Ford from Fairport, N.Y., to Put-in-Bay to spend the summer. ''You genuinely feel like you're in a different place.'' Mr. Lowe has been visiting the region since the 1940s, and says he has already booked his rental for next summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Put-in-Bay's island neighbors include Kelleys, Middle Bass and North Bass, which deliver their own brands of escapism, but with less night life, less frequent ferry service, more solitude and slightly lower property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those not enamored of island life, the nearby Ohio shore also features second-home living. Oak Harbor sits on a broad river that leads to Lake Erie, and overflows with gingerbread porches and roadside fruit stands. Port Clinton, home to the Jet Express high-speed ferry, features century-old lakefront homes with long front lawns. It also offers charming inland Victorians; a drawbridge; a high concentration of condos, Super-8 motels and <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> for island-hopping day-trippers; and an August festival that celebrates polkas, perch, peaches and pirogi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marblehead, about 11 miles east of Port Clinton, has the area's most famous lighthouse and extensive second-home and condo developments. Three miles west is Lakeside, a 135-year-old Chautauqua community where about 900 mostly older Victorians and saltboxes are crammed into one square mile on lots that originally held tents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Scene</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The village of Put-in-Bay can be a party town. Sybarites pour off the Jet Express ferry early, whoop it up in the village, then pour themselves back on a late boat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cars are neither encouraged nor useful in Put-in-Bay. So on weekends the village can take on the giddy tone of a Victorian-faced midway ride, with golf cart drivers careering from T-shirt shop to ice-cream parlor to watering hole, sometimes narrowly missing pedestrians and other cart drivers. Meanwhile, the cool breezes sough, sailboats nod in the harbor and, indoors, jukeboxes roar out like thunder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you get on that ferry, a pressure valve goes off,'' said Corky McIlrath-Flint, whose family has had a second home on South Bass Island since the 1960s, when her father bought a lot with a hunting shack that evolved into a cottage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McIlrath-Flint, who is a local real estate agent, added that the place has two distinct cultures. ''You can choose to partake in the camaraderie on Main Street,'' she said, ''but there are so many other things to do.'' That includes boating, swimming and fishing for walleye, lake perch and smallmouth bass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solitude and inhabitability are best found together in fall. The lake is shallow, and the water holds the summer's heat. Many local residents say September and October are the best months on the lake, and the weather often stays mild through Halloween.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Winter is a lot of fun here,'' Ms. McIlrath-Flint added. ''If the ice comes in good, we have ice-fishing parties. Sometimes we drive to the mainland on a trail marked with Christmas trees.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Properties that are on their eighth generation of owners give the area continuity, residents say, and create a sense of safety, especially for children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pros</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of the village of Put-in-Bay, solitude is the great appeal. Even so, Cleveland, Toledo and the Cedar Point amusement park aren't so far away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cons</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The old cottage culture is being altered as small dwellings give way to three-story second homes with three-car-garages. And Lake Erie does have a dark side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The lake is scary,'' said Dave Warga, a fifth-grade teacher in Marblehead who bought a second home in Put-in-Bay three years ago for $330,000. ''Because it's shallow, when it warms up it breeds storms. You really have to know the lake to be out on the lake.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Real Estate Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is actually three markets: the islands, the shores and Lakeside. Island landowners generally don't sell unless family circumstances dictate. That, combined with the high cost of ferrying building materials to the islands, discourages new construction. Seekers of new golf-and-condo developments are directed to Marblehead and Catawba Island, where there are many such spreads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a pecking order for water-related properties -- lakefront, bayfront, riverfront and canal,'' said John Rader, an agent with Re/Max Lake Shore Realty in Port Clinton. ''Some have just a deeded dock. But it's better than not having any access to the water.'' He said that the supply of shoreline properties currently exceeds demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The island second-home market is very steady,'' Ms. McIlrath-Flint said. ''There was never a superinflated bubble. It's not a flip-it market. In fact, our biggest job is educating buyers who think they can swoop in and pick up something cheap. That doesn't happen here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The median prices of properties on the islands mirror the amount of commercial development. Middle Bass Island has a lower average price -- around $290,000. Kelleys Island is slightly more commercial, and the average price is about $390,000. Put-in-Bay is around $425,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Port Clinton and Marblehead waterfront real estate starts at $70,000 for a small lot of undeveloped land, with lakefront condos priced at $75,000 and up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Lakeside, ''properties range from $190,000 to around $1 million, and it's based on the proximity of the property to the lakefront,'' said Charlene Carroll, an agent with Lakeside Chautauqua Realty. The average is around $350,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many times people stumble across Lakeside,'' Ms. Carroll said. ''They weren't planning to buy at all, and before they know it they're down at the real estate office, pulling listings. They're in disbelief that a place like this exists.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course it exists. Ernie Pyle could have told you so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAY OF THE LAND</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WITH the property market in turmoil, especially in the United States, real estate agents around the country are increasing their efforts to woo the Russian oligarchs, Korean industrialists and other international buyers who have been making news with splashy top-dollar purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are the most aggressive buyers in the market right now,'' said Kevin McBride, an agent with Atlanta Fine Homes Sotheby's International in Atlanta. In international hubs like Atlanta, overseas clients now account for anywhere from 10 to 30 percent of sales, industry experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Immobel, a company based in Warsaw that specializes in translating online real estate listings into 13 languages, has seen the number of American agents using its services jump by 30 percent in the last year, said Janet Choynowski, the company's chief executive. Agents are ''really eager to reach out to buyers proactively by any means they can,'' Ms. Choynowski said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even before the financial meltdown of the last few weeks, there was growing concern that the flow of international buyers into the United States was slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study by the National Association of Realtors found the number of agents who sold a home to an international buyer actually decreased in the last year, from 18 percent to 13.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the dollar has strengthened in the last six months, diminishing the so-called ''currency exchange discount'' that helped make American property a bargain for many foreign buyers. The euro was worth $1.60 in July; it has been about $1.30 recently. The British pound has dropped from $2.10 in November 2007 to a little over $1.60.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The dollar has gotten stronger and that makes the investment appeal that much weaker,'' said Melissa Cohn, president of Manhattan Mortgage Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cohn said the number of international buyers in New York City has dropped by 50 percent in the last six months. And with credit tight, the list of mortgage companies in the city willing to finance a purchase by a foreign resident has dropped from 10 to 4, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is not good news in Manhattan, where international buyers typically buy a third or more of the apartments in new buildings, local experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But international buyers continue to play an important role in the local market. For the W New York Downtown, a 56-story project under development in Manhattan, 74 percent of the initial sales have been to foreign buyers, primarily from South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and Italy, a project spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, which has been particularly hard hit by the market slowdown, as many as 50 percent of sales in some neighborhoods are to overseas clients, despite the credit crunch and strengthening dollar, said Teresa Kinney, chief executive of the Greater Realtor Association of Miami and the Beaches. This month the organization was host to a contingent of 150 international agents, including 103 from Russia, who toured properties and networked with Miami agents before they headed to the National Association of Realtors' annual convention in Orlando. And in the past year group members have traveled to events in Paris, Madrid and Moscow to forge alliances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's our biggest source for new business in Miami,'' Ms. Kinney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the country, industry executives are organizing similar initiatives. In September, the Texas Association of Realtors, for the first time, led 100 agents from Texas to Guadalajara, Mexico, to a trade conference. Mexican citizens were the third-largest group of international buyers in the United States last year, behind only Canada and Britain, according to the National Association of Realtors study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Hawaii, Dano Sayles of Coldwell Banker Island Properties is expanding his participation in international groups and attending conferences around the world to make new contacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What really saved my market in south Maui last year was the Canadians,'' said Mr. Sayles, who specializes in homes of more than $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Honolulu, Sakara Blackwell, president of Optimum Realty, recently hired staffers who speak Mandarin and Korean, hoping to take advantage of moves by China and Korea to loosen restrictions on their citizens' making foreign purchases. Overseas buyers now represent about 20 percent of her business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A couple of years ago it would have been zero,'' Ms. Blackwell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As global markets slow, agents say different types of international buyers have been emerging. In many markets, ''vultures'' are going after depressed and foreclosed properties, sensing that the bottom is near. Others are looking at luxury real estate as a safe investment, more than simply a second home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are buying in the U.S. not necessarily because they think it's cheap,'' said Ms. Choynowski, the Immobel executive. ''They're buying because they see it as a safe haven for their money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Dingley of London recently bought two properties just outside Tampa, including one that has yet to be constructed. The entrepreneur plans to move permanently to Florida as soon as his investor visa is approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Tampa International Airport has direct flights to London, and the population of Tampa is growing at 8 to 9 percent,'' he said. ''I think we are reaching the bottom of the housing market, so it's an excellent time to buy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those buyers aren't affected by credit problems -- they're paying in cash, agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the news of sharp price drops in many markets have left both investors and second-home buyers confused and uncertain. Media reports often don't reflect the luxury market, which performs differently from the general overall market in many cities, industry executives say. ''People don't know what to believe,'' said Bruce Hiatt, owner of the Luxury Realty Group in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many American companies hope the number of foreign buyers will bounce back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are buying across borders,'' Ms. Choynowski said. ''That's just the way it is now.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAST year, right around the time his clique of Hamptons summer share pals fell apart, Nick Baily and his wife, Rebecca Phillips, fell in love with the Catskills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baily's father had recently bought a place in the Catskills, and visiting his home the couple realized how much they liked it there. Soon enough, Ms. Phillips and Mr. Baily thought about buying a getaway of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's tough to go into a sort of rural area, where everyone's been there forever,'' said Mr. Baily, the director of publicity at Shore Fire Media, a Brooklyn-based public relations and online marketing firm. ''There's a real barrier for entry. You stay at a B &amp; B and think, oh, wouldn't it be nice to have a place here? To go from thinking about buying a place to looking at places -- seriously, it's a big jump. It's a little scary. You just don't know what a good deal is; you don't know the landscape. You can't go buy a manual. You need to find someone you can trust.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Web search led Mr. Baily to blog.catskill4sale.com, a blog about the real estate scene in Sullivan County, N.Y., written by David Knudsen, a broker at Catskills Buyer Agency. On his widely read site, Mr. Knudsen ruminates upon everything from current market conditions to energy drilling and new restaurant openings. Mr. Baily said he read ''pages and pages'' of the blog, and not only was he convinced he'd found his real-estate agent, he said, but he also gained confidence in his decision to buy a home in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That real-estate agents have an online presence is nothing new. (According to a 2007 study from the National Association of Realtors, 84 percent of home buyers use the Internet in their search.) What's changing, however, is the growing importance that blogs play in the real-estate world in general, and in the vacation-home market in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For brokers, blogs are, of course, a handy marketing tool: they're economical, practical and easy to update. But for prospective buyers, a sophisticated blog -- one with more than an agent's plea, ''check out my new listing'' -- can help potential buyers forge a connection to a faraway community, learn the landscape of an area and, ultimately, make informed purchasing decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Blogs are a medium that are well suited to a mix of information, opinion and personality,'' said Mr. Baily, who, working with Mr. Knudsen, bought a fixer-upper Victorian on 22 acres in Bethel, N.Y., in August. ''If the person is well-informed and has the background to contextualize the information for you, it's a really great way to keep your finger on the pulse of something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, agents' blogs are tools to attract new clients. ''If you're going to sell a home in the mountains, you're going to have to sell the mountains,'' said Elwin Wood, a real estate broker who is also chairman of community and economic development for the Sullivan County Legislature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, comprehensive vacation-home blogs -- ones that address everything from details on the real estate market (Is inventory on the rise? Is it possible to buy a waterfront home for under $500,000?) to quality-of-life questions (Is there cellphone service? Can I get a pizza delivered?) -- can help potential buyers get a sense of a community that they may have visited only once, twice, or never.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thing about a second-home market, it takes people three, four trips to an area before they buy something,'' said Mike Kennedy, an agent at Railey Realty in McHenry, Md., and a prolific poster on his company's blog (realty.railey.com/blog) about vacation homes at Deep Creek Lake. ''You'd spend half the time looking at houses, half the time in the car answering questions about the area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the blog, he said, ''you work through some of those things up front, as opposed to the three, four trips that it takes people to get educated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joanne Hanson, a broker-blogger, agrees. The clients who come to her via her blog, www.mountain-living.com/blog[http://www.mountain-living.com/blog], ''come to us much more ready to buy,'' said Ms. Hanson, leader of the Mountain Living Team at Coldwell Banker Colorado Rockies Real Estate in Frisco, Colo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such was the case for Jeff Geslin, a Houston-based geological adviser for <span class="companylink">ExxonMobil</span>. Earlier this year, he and his wife, Lorna Campbell, decided to buy a mountain home in Summit County, Colo., about 90 minutes from Denver, where Mr. Geslin's family lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We weren't familiar with the real estate in the area, and we weren't familiar with having a second home that we were going to rent out,'' said Mr. Geslin, who said his agent pointed him toward Ms. Hanson's blog for answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout the spring, the couple did an enormous amount of research online and looked frequently to Ms. Hanson's blog for advice. ''When we showed up in June, we had a pretty good idea of our price range, what we were interested in and how we were going to manage it,'' said Mr. Geslin, who visited 15 properties in a single day, revisited two on the second day and made an offer on a furnished two-bedroom condo on the third. ''It made for a very effective trip.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes it's the nitty-gritty market details on a blog that help buyers take the plunge. Kathy Murray, along with her husband, Rob Murray, her father-in-law, Bob Murray, and his girlfriend, Christine Prettyman, were interested in purchasing a home at Deep Creek Lake, in western Maryland. The family, who plan to rent out their home when it's not in use, knew they wanted a place with multiple master bedrooms -- but, thanks to the Railey Realty blog, expanded their must-have list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The blog gave us insight into the rental market,'' Kathy Murray said. ''We knew what we liked; they had a different perspective.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Murray said what they hadn't considered were the little extras that help a property do well in the short-term rental market, such as a great view or interesting architecture. Looking at the blog, they realized that there were ''a lot of factors to consider when buying a rental home,'' she said. ''You need to have a pool table, Ping-Pong, some sort of entertainment. I could care less if there was a pool table. But in the rental market that we're going to go into, that appeals to people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late September, the family closed on a five-bedroom, five-bath newly built chalet with a ''fantastic view,'' according to Ms. Murray, where there's plenty of room for the pool table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For agents, a blog can provide an avenue for a slightly softer sell. Karin Elliott, an agent with IBA Mountain Homes in Big Canoe, a resort community about an hour north of Atlanta, said that every three or four posts on her blog (ibamountainhomes.com/wordpress/), she writes about a listing -- to little effect. ''People blow past that -- they don't want to read that,'' said Ms. Elliott, who focuses on life's little details, like mushroom hunting and the local Oktoberfest. ''I just write about the stuff that doesn't stress people out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelli Clay and her husband, Brett Newsom, bought a two-bedroom cottage in Big Canoe in March. Ms. Clay said she discovered the community, as well as her future vacation home, via Ms. Elliott's blog. ''It's not a hard sell,'' said Ms. Clay, who lives in suburban Atlanta and as a wellness instructor helps families live healthy lives. ''It talks more about the day-to-day life in Big Canoe. It's a warmer feeling, in terms of the draw. It kills two birds with one stone in a very nice way: there might be a soft-sell point to it, but you can completely ignore the selling point if you're not interested.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A good second-home blog is a little bit like an opinionated Web cam,'' said Mr. Knudsen, who, thanks to his blog, is something of a celebrity in Sullivan County. ''With second-home blogging, you're communicating information to people at a distance -- a little bit like an electronic newspaper for people who don't have ready access to the local newspaper, who aren't stopping into a local bar or restaurant and picking up local gossip and tidbits.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, some find these blogs better than the local newspaper. During his Catskills home search, Mr. Baily had the local newspaper delivered to his Brooklyn Heights home. ''I read it every day,'' he said. ''I didn't renew it. What I read from David's blog was much more helpful.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE chill of autumn has arrived, and it's time to make your home cozy and snug. Replace those broken shingles, seal the window frames, start the water boiling and throw in some scented nutmegy things, or a rabbit if you've been disappointed in love.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what to do about that ghost that has been making such a racket, scaring the guests and making it impossible to sleep? Sure, you can kid yourself that it's a squirrel on the roof or a rattling pipe or a fog that comes up from time to time. (On Narragansett Bay? Sure, pal, that's credible.) But eventually, when guests and family members become truly frightened, something must be done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such was the case with Kathleen Whitehurst, an artist in Arnaudville, La., who scoured the countryside to salvage materials with which to build her home and guest house, the picturesque l'Esprit des Chenes. Visitors complained of creaking stairs, sounds in the night. Some fled in terror. Finally, Ms. Whitehurst called in a specialist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She came all the way from Arkansas,'' Ms. Whitehurst said in a telephone conversation. ''She sat on my couch, and within 30 minutes she says, 'Yes, you do have a ghost in your house.' She goes into a trance, she came back to her body, and said, 'He's a Baptist minister, wearing a white robe, and he's roaming the house.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason for this problem, incredible as it may seem, was recycling. Ms. Whitehurst had found three Gothic windows in a junk pile at a demolished church, and the ghost had come along with them. The specialist did what is often recommended in these cases, asking Ms. Whitehurst and two friends to make a circle with her around the lost spirit, and tell it, sympathetically but firmly, that it was time to move along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of a sudden, you could feel the electrical energy moving -- it was so intense that all the hair on the back of my neck and hands was standing up,'' Ms. Whitehurst said. ''And when she said the final words'' -- Go, go! -- ''we got that zapped feeling. And he went up, and he's never been back since.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You don't believe in ghosts? Then you are either tragically out of step with the times or possibly a slovenly spiritual housekeeper looking for an excuse to avoid tidying up. A recent <span class="companylink">Google</span> Internet search for getting rid of ghosts yielded nearly two million hits. By comparison, a search for cleaning rain gutters yielded 191,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a Harris poll last year of 2,000 adults, 41 percent said that they believed in ghosts. Although the National Association of Realtors says that it is not the legal obligation of a real estate agent to tell a prospective buyer about alleged haunting, many agents, like Diane Ragan of <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in New Orleans, feel that if they hear of something that may distress a buyer, they have the duty to pass it on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just last week I got a call from a past client who was calling for a friend who'd leased a place and wasn't happy because it was haunted,'' she said. ''He wanted his deposit back. I told him the best thing his friend could do was plead his case.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can These Stubborn Spiritual Stainbuckets Never Be Removed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before attempting to cleanse a household of ghostlike sounds and scents, the homeowner must first determine whether such sounds and scents are actually of the other world. Happily, there is no shortage of instruction manuals on the subject. One, an e-book called ''Is My House Haunted? A Practical Guide,'' was written by Bonnie Vent, the medium who founded the San Diego Paranormal Research Project. Those who dismiss the paranormal may wish to check out her Web site, sdparanormal.com, and read the transcript of her conversation with the comic George Carlin, which occurred after his death. (Few were as skeptical of the afterlife as he.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Vent's guide, which costs $7.97, contains a paranormal activity log in which to record such things as electrical devices going on and off, unexplained noises and cold and hot spots. It lists common misconceptions, including the notion that ''paying someone to spread lotions and potion all over the house'' will make the spirits go away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What does work? Communication!!!'' writes Ms. Vent, who is one of those people who is paid; her cleansing services cost $125 an hour. ''This does not necessarily mean that they will leave, but you should be able to work out a livable situation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also offered a word of warning: ''There are people who will take advantage of others by using holy water, burning sage and spreading salt around the perimeter of the house. Spirit people are people -- these things have no effect in the long term. You really have to get to the root cause.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, as His Intimates Knew, Uncle Fred Never Flushed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With ghosts so plentiful, it is reassuring to note that most haunting sites, even those with logos dripping blood, take their responsibilities seriously, reminding homeowners concerned about paranormal activity that they should first seek more mundane reasons for strange activity. The tools may include tape recorders, video equipment and infrared photography.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, the stars of the ''Ghost Hunters'' program on the Sci Fi Channel, have been helped by their expertise as plumbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had one case, somebody's dead uncle Fred was a plumber and they thought that he was giving them a sign because every morning at 2 a.m. their toilet would flush,'' Mr. Hawes said. ''Come to find out, they would go to bed at about 11 at night and they had a leaky flapper in their toilet. Eventually, after two or three hours, the toilet would drain down enough that the fill valve would kick on, so it would sound like the toilet would flush.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any other examples?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We dealt with a case where a guy was actually seeing apparitions in his house,'' Mr. Hawes said. ''It was happening only to him, nobody else was having problems. We found out he was on two medications, including an older one his new doctor didn't know about, and they were making him see things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wilson added: ''Another reason we knew it wasn't paranormal was the things he was seeing made no sense. There were grotesque things: flowers wandering across the room, faces turning inside out. Paranormal activity isn't like that. Seeing flowers turning inside out indicates medical or drug problems, not a person without a body walking around your home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Minor Hauntings, Do It Yourself</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many hauntings are so slight that the homeowners may feel equipped to handle the problem themselves. This was the experience of Leslie Castay Burkey, a onetime Broadway actress, and her husband, Bryan Burkey, a commercial photographer, who bought an old New Orleans home from the estate of a deceased couple a few years ago. The lady of the house, Ms. Burkey had heard, was ''tough, cold and devoted to the house above everything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Problems began with the restoration of the former master bedroom. Ms. Burkey spoke of bad odors and lights going on and off. Her husband recalled ''a definite presence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we started ripping stuff out, it was like the house was saying what are you doing, and would get really persnickety,'' Mr. Burkey said. ''When we started to take up the carpet and put down a wood floor, all sorts of things went crazy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incredible! How could anyone have anything against a wood floor?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we heard was she had a white carpet in that bedroom that she was very much in love with,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White carpet -- the decorating equivalent of falling in love with a married man, an enterprise doomed to failure and heartbreak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple's solution, which proved effective, was to cleanse the home with sage they bought at Marie Laveau's House of Voodoo in the French Quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The salesperson suggested you burn it and carry it through the house, especially through the doors and windows, and make your own incantations telling the spirits they were free to leave,'' Ms. Burkey said. ''A friend of mine in Connecticut got the idea she should do it in the shape of a pentagram, but that was too black magic for me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shock of a Mao Jacket Might Have Killed Him</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guy Clark is an interior designer who restores and sells old properties. Spirits do not trouble him. His current home is a stone house in Bullville, N.Y., which was once owned by the makeup artist Kevyn Aucoin, who died in 2002. As he was lying in bed shortly after he took possession, Mr. Clark had a vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I opened my eyes for a second and someone passed over my head through the window in a blue cabana suit, blue shorts and a shirt, like what people wore in the '60s,'' Mr. Clark said. ''You can't make these things up. I didn't know the man, but I think it was probably Kevyn. He was airlifted out of his front yard and passed away from a brain tumor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did Mr. Clark deal with the spirit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I said: 'O.K., this is my house. If you need anything, I'm here, but you don't live here anymore, move on.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However contradictory the message, the ghost apparently understood, for Mr. Clark never again had a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enough! Now, Let a Hardened Realtor Set the Record Straight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've had two properties that fall into that category,'' said Judy Moore, a broker with 23 years of experience who works with ReMax Landmark Realtor in Lexington, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first one was the former parish house where the priest stayed, and it came up at the closing. The home's owner said, 'I just want you to know that there is a priest who haunts this house,' and went on to tell the story that she grew up in the house, and one time her sister had makeup on top of the dresser and he swiped them off. I was horrified. The buyer could have just said, 'That's it, I couldn't live there' -- but he was a creative type; he was fine with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The other time was really freaky. This is a house that never did sell. It was built in the 1600s, nobody was living there. The first thing that happened when I walked in, my electronic tape stopped working, and I had the funny feeling that there were spirits in the house, and I don't imagine these sorts of things. I was staging it, there were things that would move, but the worst thing -- the really freaky thing -- I was putting some dried flowers on the end of this old table and I saw something on the table that was bright red but watery. It looked like blood, but it was too thin, everything on the table was dry. That was the creepiest thing that has ever happened to me in this business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suddenly, a Reporter Is Aware of Her Psychic Gifts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be noted that when the New England real estate agent mentioned above was reached on her cellphone, it was about 6 in the evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So, are you driving down the Mass Turnpike in pitch-blackness?'' she was asked in an attempt to set the mood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oh my God -- how did you know?'' Ms. Moore said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October After October, Reporters Trudge to His Door</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Nickell, the ghost hunter for the magazine Skeptical Inquirer, has a doctorate in English literature from the University of Kentucky and was once a professional magician. He has, he says, been investigating stories of ghosts for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever catch one?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One common reason that people believe they see ghosts is that they are experiencing lifelike dreams, Mr. Nickell said. This is why such visions often occur at bedtime. Also, many people enjoy the notion of being haunted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unfortunately, most people are looking to have their beliefs confirmed, so they bring in ghost hunter types who believe they can get an electromagnetic field meter from <span class="companylink">RadioShack</span>,'' he said. ''They go into a place and the meter starts going off, whereupon they think they are detecting a ghost. First of all, there is no evidence ghosts exist. Second, there is no evidence that if ghosts exist, they are electromagnetic. These people have no knowledge of microwave towers or faulty wiring in the house or other sources of electromagnetism. It's just too silly for words and it oughtn't be featured on major television shows. It's an embarrassment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Give us an example of someone who was tricked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A young mother called me once very concerned about the possibility of ghosts,'' he said. ''She was getting strange photographs -- a sort of curvy stripe, very white and bright. They have since begun calling those ectoplasmic strands. I looked at her camera. Her wrist strap was dangling. The flash was reflecting back the wrist strap, and it produced a great number of these.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frankly, the Believers Tell a Much Better Story</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brenda is a social worker with a master's degree from the University of Pittsburgh. She lives with her husband, two young children and four ghosts (two adults, two children) in a 99-year-old house in Altoona, Pa. (After receiving death threats when she went public about her home, she prefers that only her first name be used.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The odd happenings in her household began when her daughter, Anna, 6, was a toddler. Anna sometimes laughed and giggled when nobody was around. ''I figured it was an imaginary playmate,'' she said. ''I was not really thinking paranormal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About this time the name Katie would just pop into her head for no particular reason, she added. ''I was potty training Anna, she was sitting with her book. I stepped away for five minutes and I hear her fighting with somebody, saying, 'It's mine, it's mine!' I turned to go back, the book was levitating above her head like it was being held up by somebody a little bit taller.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That book was huge, a big Christmas flip book,'' she continued. ''She said, 'Mommy, mommy, I'm sharing! I'm sharing with Katie!' Then it clicked. I'm trying to remain calm because we're potty training and anything can throw that off. I said, 'Anna, who's Katie?' She said just a little girl who lives here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A month or so later, on a Saturday morning when Brenda was doing some dishes, she heard giggling and footsteps around her and saw the girl ghost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She had blond hair parted down the middle, the first piece tucked behind her ear like Marcia Brady,'' Brenda said. ''She was neat as a pin, in a little calico print dress that had a pinafore, off-white, all starched, kind of like Laura Ingalls. She had some kind of stockings, boots -- that's how long I had to notice what this girl had on. And a Peter Pan collar.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brenda said she had been doing the dishes, but could she have fallen asleep? There is this dream state an expert mentioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No, no, absolutely not,'' Brenda said. ''The skeptics will pull out every little piddling thing they can. There is no gas leak, we are not sipping gas methane, our furnace is cleaned faithfully.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brenda now feels it is time for her spirits to be on their way. She has dutifully told them to go to the light. She has tried burning white candles for purity. She even had the people from ''Ghost Hunters'' in, appearing on their first season. How about sage? Did she try sage?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I actually have a friend who is a Reiki master who said she would do a house cleansing,'' Brenda said. ''I would rather have somebody come in to guide them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever Notice a Spirit Never Washes A Dish or Takes Out the Garbage?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meticulous housekeeper has by now noted that as with so much else, the world of the paranormal is specialized. Ghost hunters often call in others to rid a home of ghosts: so-called house cleaners, perhaps, or, in some cases, demonologists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patty A. Wilson, 43, the author with Mark Nesbitt of ''The Big Book of Pennsylvania Ghost Stories'' and a founder of the Ghost Research Foundation, is both. Ms. Wilson, who says she has been sensitive to the paranormal since childhood, kept quiet about her gifts for much of her life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't want to be the crazy lady in the caftan,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The time for homeowners to call for professional intervention, said Ms. Wilson, who does not charge for her services and is suspicious of those who do, is when they feel frightened or threatened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such case she had, she said, involved a Penn State student who had written an article about Ms. Wilson for the college newspaper. The girl called her about five or six years ago in an agitated state, saying that the house she was renting with several other girls was haunted by an ''obese, overweight black shadow figure,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He was kind of aggressive, stepping out into the hallways in front of them so they would have to walk through him,'' Ms. Wilson added. ''He physically touched two of the girls. One was sitting on her bed in her underwear. She jumped up screaming, so he let her alone. He also seemed to be around them when they were unclothed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk about your unnatural acts! Are black shadow ghosts considered to be particularly dangerous?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some are very aggressive,'' Ms. Wilson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She advised the young woman to do some research on the house, and it was discovered that it had once been owned by two spinsters. They had taken in a neighbor who died of obesity at age 23.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought that kind of fit the bill,'' Ms. Wilson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house never did get cleaned. The college student's mother moved her out of the house, and that was that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does Ms. Wilson recall her name?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Marianne,'' she said, adding that she was unable to remember her last name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where might she be now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She joined Barnum &amp; Bailey, in publicity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ghost stories are not neat and clean,'' she added. ''Everything doesn't always get pigeonholed properly. They're real stories about real people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After intense corporeal, electronic and audio investigation, Marianne, whose last name is Ways and who did local publicity for the circus as a college intern, is tracked down. Now 28, she works as an associate booker at the Comix comedy club in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She tells a story that confirms much of Ms. Wilson's. Her roommate did see the shadow of an obese man, and he did pop up as the roommate was coming out of the shower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ways never saw the dark shadows herself, but she sometimes heard weird noises and footsteps, and felt as if someone had broken into the house when no one was there, and it frightened her. One day when she was feeling especially anxious, she asked the person who lived in the adjoining apartment if anything weird had ever happened there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You mean, like, is it haunted?'' the woman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did Ms. Ways ever try to get rid of the ghosts?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No,'' she said. ''I just left.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do Not Be Fooled by Cheap Imitations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE concerned homeowner will know by now that there is dispute about how best to rid the home of spirits. Some tools that the uninitiated might feel would be effective are not. The Ouija board, for example, is considered by many to be a magnet for spirits, the equivalent of spreading a trail of crumbs if you are plagued by ants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Megan Hoolihan, 28, manager of Marie Laveau's House of Voodoo, has studied the occult for 18 years and seems to take her calling seriously. She says many people in the South believe sage has cleansing properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I recommend making a mixture of powdered sage, holy water and cedar oil, some water from a church or that has been blessed by someone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What if you're an atheist?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may be something to this occult stuff, because suddenly the reporter feels a deep chill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Cedar oil has cleansing properties,'' Ms. Hoolihan continued, ignoring the question. ''You can also use lavender oil or violet oil. The smells are soothing; it's a comfort.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bunch of sage costs about $9 at Marie Laveau's. Couldn't you use the stuff from the supermarket instead?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can use it; I don't recommend it. It's the same family, but not the same plant. The sage we carry is white sage or gray sage, and is grown organically.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of new homes recorded an unexpected increase in September as median home prices dropped to the lowest level in four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported Monday that sales of new single-family homes rose 2.7 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 464,000 homes. Economists had expected sales would drop from the August level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home sold in September declined 9.1 percent from a year ago to $218,400, the lowest price level since September 2004, a period when home prices were rising rapidly as the country experienced a five-year housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surprising increase in September sales still left them 33.1 percent below the level of a year ago as the country is battered by the worst housing slump in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report on a rise in new-home sales followed news last week that sales of existing homes rose in September by 5.5 percent, the largest monthly gain in more than five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are not convinced that the sales increases are signaling a bottom for the housing market. They said that the September gains came before the latest upheavals in financial markets, which have raised new worries about the overall state of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many analysts believe the country has already entered a recession. They are forecasting significant increases in job losses that will make it even harder to mount a sustained rebound in housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell 21.4 percent in the Northeast and were down 5.8 percent in the Midwest. But sales rose by 22.7 percent in the West, a region that has had some of the biggest declines in prices, a development that has spurred sales. Sales were up 0.7 percent in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in sales left a total of 394,000 unsold new homes on the market at the end of September, down a record 25.4 percent from the number of unsold homes on the market at the end of September 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have been sharply cutting back on production, trying to get inventories more in line with sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the latest drop in total unsold new homes, the inventory represents a 10.4 months supply at the September sales pace, still a historically high level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of unsold existing homes is also near historic highs as that market is having a record wave of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2.7 percent rise in sales for September new-home sales followed a big 12.6 percent drop in August, which was revised sharply lower from the government's initial estimate. Sales in July rose 3.6 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly home resales rose the most in five years in September, according to figures released Friday, with the sales driven largely by bargain-basement prices on foreclosed homes. But the numbers probably do not reflect a permanent turn in the markets, because the credit crisis has intensified since these transactions took place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales -- that is, homes that were owned by someone else, as opposed to newly built homes -- rose 5.5 percent in September over the previous month and 1.4 percent over the last 12 months. The national numbers were buoyed mostly by foreclosure sales in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors, the group that released the numbers on Friday, estimated that 35 to 40 percent of resold homes nationwide were distressed assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's pretty clear that these are sales of foreclosed properties at bargain prices, so given that, it doesn't look like this is the turning point,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of existing homes in September was down 9 percent over the previous 12 months. The decline was particularly acute in the West, where prices were down 18.5 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, prices nationwide were down 9.5 percent on a year-on-year basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' report is based on transactions that closed in September but that were probably agreed upon one to two months earlier. Because of this, the upturn in sales most likely does not indicate that a bottom has been reached because the report does not reflect the credit market turmoil that escalated in late September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What this means is that in some areas affordability is coming into the market, and that's the good news,'' said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at Merk Mutual Funds. ''The bad news is that the September data was collected before the credit market really seized up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sclerotic credit market has made it harder for people to buy homes unless they have pristine credit. Other recessionary forces -- like the declining job market and major stock market losses -- also spell bad news for home sales in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All indications are that we have a long way to go before the housing market stabilizes,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. He noted that the tough credit market, as well as Americans' reluctance to buy a home when they expect prices to keep falling, forecast poor housing sales in the coming months. ''It's about as bad a market as you can get.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were many more homes on the market than people willing to buy them in September; it would take 9.9 months to sell off the existing inventory of used homes based on the September monthly sales rate. While this figure has been declining over recent months, it is still historically high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Inventories are very high relative to sales rates, and would probably be even more so if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market instead of pulling it off in the face of weak demand and eroding prices,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist of MFR Inc., wrote in a client note.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KRISTINA SHEVORY   </div><div>1413 words</div><div>22 October 2008</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEATTLE -- Not long ago, Seattle looked invincible, even as an economic downturn was starting to plague the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-profile Seattle-area companies like <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and Amazon were adding thousands of jobs, trade with Asia was strong and <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> was selling thousands of commercial jets. Deemed the best office market in the country in some nationwide reports, the city was attracting real estate investors hungry to buy office buildings and build new projects. It seemed as if nothing could go wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Out here in Seattle, we were living in a bubble, immune from the rest of the country,'' said Bruce Blume, founder of a real estate development firm, the Blume Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such enthusiasm started deflating this year. <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, based here, is slashing more than 7 percent of its global work force and closing hundreds of stores. Weyerhaeuser, the former lumber giant, trimmed 1,000 jobs and sold off divisions. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> workers went on strike, and home builders and mortgage companies shed staff. Starting next month, Alaska Airlines, also based in Seattle, is getting rid of 1,000 positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>, the country's biggest savings-and-loan, was seized by federal regulators. <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> is buying the bank's deposits and assets, and is still formulating its plans for the company. An announcement is expected in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job growth in Puget Sound, a four-county region that includes Seattle, is expected to shrink to 1.7 percent, from 2.9 percent, this year, according to Conway Pedersen Economics, an economic forecasting concern. ''Our economy has gone flat in 2008,'' said Dick Conway, an economist at the firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapse of <span class="companylink">WaMu</span>, which employs more than 3,500 in downtown Seattle, rattled the city's confidence and led many companies to question their projects or expansions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacancy rate for office space in the central business district reached 10 percent in the third quarter, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, still below the nationwide average, but up from 8.4 percent a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With five new buildings, encompassing about two million square feet, opening next year, the vacancy rate is expected to hit 15 percent. Most of the new space has not been leased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacancy rate could go even higher if <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> -- the city's largest downtown tenant with 1.6 million square feet -- vacates space. Brokers estimate the bank could give up as much as one million square feet. The company built a new 42-story headquarters in downtown Seattle for $300 million and moved in only in 2006. It also rents space in other nearby buildings and has made some of that space available for sublease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies may shed space or are already trying to do so. <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> has 390,000 square feet up for sale or lease after spending an undisclosed amount two years ago to purchase an eight-story office building and adjacent parcels. <span class="companylink">Safeco</span>, an insurance company that was purchased by the <span class="companylink">Liberty Mutual Group</span> in April, is expected to sublease half of its space, or 200,000 square feet. Heller Ehrman, a century-old San Francisco law firm, is dissolving and may try to sublease more than 100,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nobody thought it would be like this,'' said Bob Mooney, a managing director at the commercial real estate firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> in Seattle. ''This has hit everyone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an abrupt turnaround since last year, when <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis</span>, a commercial real estate brokerage, and the Urban Land Institute both named Seattle as one of the top five office markets in the country for investors. Sales of office buildings reached $11.47 billion in 2007, some seven times what they were in 2004, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. Deals so far this year have totaled only $375 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although building prices have tumbled in 2008, it hasn't been enough to keep investors interested. Since last year, the price to acquire office space has shrunk 32 percent, to an average of $227 a square foot, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, credit has largely dried up and has forced many companies and developers to postpone deals. Early this month, a buyer for Qwest Communication International's 32-story office tower backed out after losing his financing. The building has been on the market since March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alfred Clise knows this all too well. The president of a family real estate development firm, Clise Properties, withdrew a 13-acre parcel in downtown Seattle, mainly parking lots and low-rise office buildings, from the market in April, after nearly a year in which he couldn't find a buyer willing to offer more than $600 million and to develop the area in a way that he believed it deserved. Mr. Clise says he thinks the parcel would be an ideal site for a grand multibillion-dollar development like Rockefeller Center in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has also become difficult to fill buildings. Rents have jumped 13 percent from a year earlier, to $35.80 a square foot annually in the third quarter, in part because some big landlords bought at the top of the market and are trying to cover their high costs. As enticement, brokers say landlords are throwing in three to six months of free rent, and as much as $100 a square foot in tenant improvements. Still, these incentives have not been enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything is on hold,'' said David Gurry, a senior vice president at Colliers International in Seattle. ''Tenants are waiting to see what happens with <span class="companylink">WaMu</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blume, a developer with a reputation for timing the market well, is still looking for tenants for a five-story life science and laboratory building that is scheduled to open in a month. Another project with 575,000 square feet of office, retail and biotech space is planned nearby, but it may be suspended unless a tenant can be found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schnitzer West, a developer based in Bellevue, Wash., may put its plans for a 750,000-square-foot tower, to be called M5 Commerce Centre, on the back burner next year if leasing doesn't go well for its other projects, which have a total of 562,000 square feet: an office building opening this month and another to be completed next fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Ivanoff, Schnitzer West's founder and managing investment partner, is one of many developers pinning their hopes on the technology, biotech and aerospace industries. Seven years ago, the three industries suffered through the collapse of technology stocks and the travel slowdown after the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lately, a number of concerns with connections to these industries have been active. In July, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation broke ground on a new 12-acre headquarters just north of downtown. Amazon is more than doubling its 1.6 million square feet of leased space. Construction of the first of 11 office buildings started in January, and a few months ago the bookseller said it had options to occupy another 500,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, which has hired people every year since it opened in the region in 1979, continues to hire and lease new space. The technology giant, which has leased nearly two million square feet outside town over the last 18 months, is rumored to be close to a lease for 350,000 square feet in South Lake Union, a neighborhood a little more than a mile from downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Seattle is still in a much better position than the rest of the country,'' said Greg Inglin, an associate at Pacific Real Estate Partners in Seattle, ''and we have <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and Amazon to thank.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN another time, Wayne Puff, who had run a small limousine company and twice filed for bankruptcy, might not have won the confidence of major banks or investors with sizable portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But during the heady days of the real estate boom, some 1,200 investors from across the country poured $123.3 million into his company, New Jersey Affordable Homes. Mr. Puff advertised guaranteed annual returns of 15 to 20 percent from his business buying, renovating and reselling real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, more than a decade after he began his real estate investment company, Mr. Puff, 60, of Old Bridge, is being held without bail in the Essex County Jail. Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney for New Jersey, charged Mr. Puff in June with bilking investors and mortgage lenders through a Ponzi scheme based on mortgage fraud. His company was forced into receivership three years ago, but the mess is still being unwound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic meltdown has focused national attention on Wall Street greed, freewheeling mortgage lenders and lax regulations. All this set the stage for what federal prosecutors say has been a sharp increase in mortgage fraud in neighborhoods across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, more than 500 people have been arrested on federal charges related to mortgage fraud, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal prosecutors accused Mr. Puff of employing the usual elements of mortgage fraud: from offices in Woodbridge and Perth Amboy, he worked with a mortgage broker who fudged applications and appraisers who pumped up real estate values. Properties were flipped between insiders at artificially increasing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scheme cost investors $55 million, saddled banks with $25 million in bad loans and plunged 400 New Jersey properties into legal limbo, according to court records. About half of the homes were in already struggling sections of Newark, Irvington and East Orange in Essex County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, seven people who worked closely with Mr. Puff's company -- two appraisers, four employees and a paralegal for one of his lawyers -- have pleaded guilty on charges related to the scheme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors are still fighting for their money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Milija Balabanovic, 82, said he invested a total of $350,000 with Mr. Puff starting in the late 1990s. A former landlord himself, he is once again banging his knuckles under kitchen sinks and mowing yards at two houses he bought with what little money he had left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am not asking anyone to feel sorry for me or anything like that, but I was a self-made millionaire, and now I am a pauper,'' he said. ''Why he was allowed to do business I do not understand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of his longest-standing friends said they were surprised that Mr. Puff had built such a large enterprise. Lois Keegan said she first met Mr. Puff in the '80s when she was tending bar and he had just moved to New Jersey from Colorado, where he had worked as a ski instructor. She described him as a ''fun'' and ''adventurous'' guy who was the center of a group of 20 friends. She said he worked as a home-repair contractor and came up with a stream of marginal business ideas, including one she partook in called Lady Limousine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He had two women drivers, myself and somebody else,'' she said. ''I guess people didn't notice how rickety the limousine was because we were in cute little limousine driving outfits.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the early '90s, Mr. Puff was focused on his real estate investment firm, hiring dozens of employees and advertising extensively on radio and in newspapers. He hired as his in-house lawyer George J. Otlowski Jr., whose father was a former mayor of Perth Amboy and a longtime state assemblyman. (Mr. Otlowski has not been charged in the case.) And he arranged to accept money from I.R.A. accounts through <span class="companylink">Fiserv Trust Company</span>, which administered $46 billion in self-directed retirement and custodial accounts. (Its parent company sold the unit to <span class="companylink">Ameritrade</span> this year.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that suggested credibility in the minds of his investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Kelleher said he began investing with the company in 1995, as he prepared to retire from the Department of Defense. He brought in his brother, Bob, and several friends from a marina in Atlantic Highlands, where he kept a small boat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unbeknownst to them, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities raised concerns in 1996 about Mr. Puff's claimed returns and failure to register his securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were some discussions with state and federal regulators but no action was taken against Mr. Puff until three years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Mr. Puff occasionally impressed investors with his fame as a swing dancer. Natalie Gomez, a three-time world swing-dancing champion, took Mr. Puff along for a group appearance on the ''Today'' show on NBC in 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelleher said that Mr. Puff's grace and showmanship on his feet was matched by his facility with banter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We used to call him 'Twinkle Toes,' '' Mr. Kelleher said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities filed a civil complaint in Essex County accusing Mr. Puff of selling unregistered securities. By then, Affordable Homes had 526 active investors who had put in a total of $23.4 million, the complaint said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2002, Mr. Puff signed a consent decree in the case agreeing to stop listing multiple investors on the mortgages for single properties and to offer some investors a chance to pull their money out. His plans typically required investors to leave their money untouched for one to five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most of his investors were not made aware of those actions. Under the agreement, only those eligible to withdraw money had to be notified. In a letter to those investors, Mr. Puff said the company could suffer cash flow problems as a result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For help, he turned to one of his investors, Herman Gross, of Great Neck on Long Island, who had run a large apparel importing business in the city and owned 50 indoor tennis centers. Mr. Gross put in $2 million to finance the bailout and would eventually invest a total of $11.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross, 91, said in a court affidavit that he had thought Mr. Puff's ''business model was brilliant'' but that he needed to ''add more professional people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November 2003, Mr. Puff hired Kenneth Lagonia, whom Mr. Puff described to investors as a Wall Street veteran. The next month Mr. Lagonia wrote a letter, which Mr. Puff showed to investors, saying he had received a ''verbal commitment'' for a $60 million bond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am happy to advise you that we have completed our due diligence on Mr. Puff and his firm, and have found them to be honest and trustworthy, with a high degree of integrity,'' Mr. Lagonia added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in 2003 a federal judge had released Mr. Lagonia from liability in a civil case the Securities and Exchange Commission had filed in 1998 against him, his partner in two businesses and other associates, charging they had swindled $1.7 million from three investors. A federal judge in Manhattan held that Mr. Lagonia, of Manorville on Long Island, had been involved in some transactions but was not aware of all the details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bond never arrived. But with Mr. Gross's cash and with regulators held at bay, Mr. Puff was on his way once again. He moved into new offices in Perth Amboy. He married Kyu Nam Park, a younger woman from Korea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of his investors were catching on. Michael B. Debbs, 73, a boating friend of Mr. Kelleher's who had moved to North Carolina, drove by a property in Aberdeen that was paying him, on paper at least, annual returns of 15 percent. He was startled to see a vacant lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I smelled a rat.'' Mr. Debbs said. ''How can they be paying me all this interest and not doing anything with the property?'' He and Mr. Kelleher said they met with Mr. Puff and Mr. Lagonia, who both tried to reassure them. Mr. Debbs decided to pull out his money, and in June 2004 Mr. Puff agreed to begin paying him $10,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelleher stayed in. So did his brother, Bob, who had invested about $200,000 that had grown to $500,000 on paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I felt pretty confident,'' said Bob Kelleher, who works in construction in Topeka, Kan. ''The money was secured by mortgages. And as far as I was concerned, I was getting a statement every month from N.J.A.H., as well as Fiserv.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By April 2005, Mr. Puff still hadn't returned $275,000 to investors who had demanded their money after the 2002 consent decree. New Jersey officials quietly went back to court. Lucy Santiago, Mr. Puff's head of investor relations, stopped taking calls from angry investors, according to court records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, nine years after he was first questioned by New Jersey regulators, the S.E.C. filed a civil complaint in federal court in Newark that resulted in the company being shut down and forced into receivership. The S.E.C. named Mr. Puff and later Mr. Lagonia as defendants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An accounting firm determined that the company had lost $20.5 million from 1999 through 2003 and needed a monthly infusion of $265,000 in new investor money to stay afloat, according to papers filed in bankruptcy court in Newark. About 90 percent of its recent revenue had been generated by flipping the properties between investors and his employees used as straw buyers, according to the court papers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutors and regulators accused the company of fraudulently claiming on mortgage applications that investors would live in the properties. Many of the company's 400 properties were in poor condition, according to Charles M. Forman, the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee. One house in Newark -- which Affordable Homes had bought for $18,250 in 2001 and sold to an investor for $212,000 in 2005 -- was deemed worthless and was demolished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The largest group of properties are those which are unoccupied and boarded up,'' Mr. Forman said in papers filed in bankruptcy court in Newark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking clear title to auction off the properties, Mr. Forman filed hundreds of lawsuits against the lenders and investors, many of whom felt victimized a second time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of the sudden we went from investors to defendants,'' Mr. Kelleher said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelleher, who had been told he had throat cancer, didn't want to fight the trustee while he was fighting for his life. He had taken out $60,000 in interest from his account, but the rest of his $150,000 investment, which his statements showed had grown to $300,000, is gone. His brother, Bob, 62, also didn't fight and put off plans to retire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Debbs barely got his money out in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Balabanovic said the trustee offered to allow him to keep the $140,000 in interest he had withdrawn from his Affordable Homes account if he would give up his rights to the properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's not even-steven, as far as I'm concerned,'' he said. ''All I want is the $350,000 that I originally invested with him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an auction at the Meadowlands sports complex last October, nearly all the properties sold for less than the mortgages Mr. Puff had on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not clear what will be left for investors. In a lawsuit against Mr. Puff filed in bankruptcy court, Mr. Forman accused Mr. Puff of pulling $5 million from the company during its last four years, often by taking company checks to check-cashing stores. The trustee won a $67.5 million default judgment against Mr. Puff. But all Mr. Puff's known bank accounts have long since been seized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Puff's criminal lawyer, Thomas J. Moran of Newark, did not return calls. Court papers this month in the criminal case said plea negotiations were under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Puff faces one count of wire fraud and one count of obstruction of justice, each carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His friends said Mr. Puff's wife returned to Korea. Ms. Keegan said she last heard from Mr. Puff more than a year ago, when he called and said he was ''in a lot of trouble'' and unable to disclose his location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it was for others who benefited from loose lending during the real estate boom, the party was over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When all this happened, we didn't want anything to do with him,'' she said. ''Sorry, Wayne, you're not fun anymore.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times, this stretch of 118th Avenue in South Jamaica, Queens, feels not so much like a neighborhood but a memory of one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A red-brick house with overgrown weeds in the yard is boarded shut. A house with a dirty awning has a thick chain looping out from a hole in the door where a deadbolt once was. On the front window of a vacant property around the corner, someone has taped a sign warning that the water supply has been shut off and antifreeze added to the sinks and toilets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newton and Ronda Whyte have gotten used to living next door to no one. ''Every two or three houses it's empty,'' said Ms. Whyte, 36, a nurse assistant. ''It's not a good feeling. You see the weeds growing tall and the junk mail piling up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This area at 118th Avenue and 153rd Street is at the center of New York's foreclosure crisis. About 28 percent of the homes in this working-class neighborhood just north of Kennedy Airport have been in some phase of foreclosure since 2004, and its census tract leads the city in foreclosure filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than two years ago, most homes here were occupied and the neighborhood was making strides against the drugs, violence and abandonment that had plagued it in the past, residents and merchants said. But today they mostly talk about decreasing property values, increasing crime, struggling small businesses and fraying community bonds. They talk of leaving, and wonder whose house is next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not even worth getting to know anybody because nobody is going to stay around anyway,'' said Fernando Espinal, 23, who grew up on 118th Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gates are down for good at the Mega Deli Grocery at one end of the avenue. Pansy Johnson, who owns Yaad Food, a nearby Caribbean restaurant, said she often has to ask for a rent extension because her sales have decreased by nearly a third. And there have been two burglaries of empty homes in foreclosure this year in the area of 118th Avenue and 153rd Street, the police said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telltale signs that a house is empty come not from a bank or real estate agent, but pizzerias and Chinese takeout restaurants: The length of time a house has been abandoned can be measured by the number of old menus, fliers and junk mail that collects on doors and stoops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like a depression,'' said Ms. Johnson, who is from the island of Jamaica, and whose restaurant is near 118th Avenue and Sutphin Boulevard. ''I've never seen so much houses boarded up in all my life in this country. It's so desolated. It hurts the heart.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This corner of South Jamaica is much like neighborhoods in other cities around the country where foreclosure has spread like an epidemic. In many of those places, a spate of subprime lending made it easy for people with modest incomes and poor credit histories to buy homes -- even as they increased their risk of foreclosure with adjustable interest rates and other types of complicated and costly loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This census tract -- No. 288 in southeast Queens -- had 226 foreclosure filings on one- to four-family homes in the past five years, the highest in the city, according to an analysis of housing data prepared for The New York Times by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University. In 2005, 69 percent of the homes purchased in the tract were bought with subprime mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you see in that community is incredibly high rates of high-cost and subprime lending,'' said Vicki Been, director of the Furman Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within Tract 288, four blocks -- encompassing 118th Avenue between 155th Street and Sutphin Boulevard, and 153rd Street between 118th and 119th Avenues -- are some of the hardest hit by foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty-nine of the roughly 140 properties on those blocks have been in various stages of foreclosure since 2004, according to data on PropertyShark.com, a real estate site. Once a foreclosure petition is filed, the owner and lender can work out a settlement. But if they do not, the home can be repossessed and sold at auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disposition of the foreclosure filings and scheduled foreclosure auctions of the 39 homes is unclear. About a dozen are vacant, blending in with other empty properties on those blocks. Two homes have eviction notices posted on them and others are undergoing renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People here seem not to have moved out so much as vanished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unlocked screen doors of unoccupied homes sway in the breeze. At a red-brick home at 152-09 118th Avenue, the front door and the living room window are boarded up, but the <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> satellite dish remains, as does the message that a former occupant traced into the top step's wet concrete long ago: three hearts and the words ''Dez-n-Duke.'' A foreclosure auction on the property is scheduled for Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the tightness that comes from living side by side in mostly narrow two-story homes, people largely keep to themselves. Few ever know for certain that neighbors are at risk of losing their homes. Departures happen quickly, mysteriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newton and Ronda Whyte remember the man who lived next to them for years in the yellow house at 152-37 118th Avenue. Mr. Whyte called him Trini, because he was from Trinidad, but he never learned the man's full name. The house the man left behind a few months ago, like the other foreclosed houses on these four blocks, quickly developed the feel of an abandoned property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the grass of their former neighbor's small yard, next to the ''For Sale'' sign, someone stuck a placard advertising the ''New York Foreclosure Showcase'' at the Long Island Marriott Hotel in Uniondale. The sign is so big and so close to the Whytes' house that some of Mr. Whyte's visiting relatives thought that he was the one at risk of foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a reminder of what's staring us in the face,'' said Ms. Whyte, who has lived on 118th Avenue with her husband and two children for 12 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the homes on these four blocks are squeezed onto narrow lots no bigger than 1,350 square feet. At one end of 118th Avenue is Baisley Pond, a swath of lush greenery that gives the area a serene suburban feel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, the median household income in Tract 288 was $44,348. Residents, many of them African-American, or of Guyanese or Jamaican descent, take pride in sweeping their stretch of sidewalk. Their ranks include custodians, nurses and retirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adeline Marshall, 66, broom in hand one recent afternoon, said the neighborhood had come far since 1991, when she bought a two-bedroom house on 153rd Street for $75,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then, there were no sidewalks, just dirt. One of the lots at the corner was trash-strewn and vacant. In July 1995, gunfire erupted during a basketball tournament at Baisley Pond Park, killing two spectators. Seven years earlier, also at the park, a high school basketball coach volunteering as a referee was beaten to death after drug gangs bet thousands of dollars on the game and the referee made a call someone did not like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Marshall, a retired practical nurse, said things had started to turn around in more recent years. The city installed sidewalks and pavement. A new residence went up on the once-empty corner lot. The population in Tract 288 grew to 4,300 in 2000 from 3,400 in 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, Ms. Marshall and other residents said, the foreclosures have stalled the neighborhood's progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Knight's 15-year-old son found a drug user's syringe in the yard of the empty house next door on 118th Avenue in June. ''In the one year being here, I've watched it just kind of spiral down,'' said Mr. Knight, a civil engineer. ''There's definitely less people, and due to less people it brings the negative element.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent Tuesday afternoon on 153rd Street, the smell of marijuana lingered in the air. Residents complain that the empty homes have encouraged people from other neighborhoods to loiter on the street, drinking beer and making noise at all hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months ago, Ms. Marshall's glass storm door was shattered by a gunshot. ''Look at the sign,'' Ms. Marshall said, pointing to the Foreclosure Showcase notice in the yard of the empty yellow house. ''What am I going to do? You think I want to stay here? I want to sell, too.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Government data released Friday showed that construction of new homes declined more than expected in September as builders cut production to the slowest pace since early 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that construction of new homes and apartments dropped 6.3 percent last month, a much bigger decline than the 1.6 percent decrease that had been expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop pushed total production to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 817,000 units. That is the slowest pace since January 1991, when the country was in a recession and going through a similar painful housing correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declines last month reflected weakness in many parts of the country. It was led by a 20.9 percent drop in the Northeast, where construction of single-family units dropped to the lowest level on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction slipped by 16.8 percent in the West, with single-family building hitting a record low there, too. The Midwest had a gain of 5.6 percent, although that reflected strength in apartment construction; single-family building hit a record low in that region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction activity in the South was up a slight 0.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for building permits, considered a good sign for future activity, also fell sharply in September, dropping 8.3 percent to an annual rate of 786,000 units, the weakest level since November 1981.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing industry, which enjoyed a five-year boom, is suffering its worst downturn in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakness in housing, in which prices have been falling sharply in many parts of the country, has caused severe economic problems. The government has been forced to rush through a $700 billion rescue package for banks, which have been hit with billions of dollars in losses from soaring defaults on mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks, worried about their cash reserves and the health of other banks and businesses, have tightened lending, causing credit markets around the world to freeze, stock markets to tumble and anxiety about a global recession to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builder sentiment dropped to a record low in October, according to the latest survey from the National Association of Home Builders, which said builder confidence had been shaken by the recent financial market troubles. Builders have been facing tighter lending standards as they try to get financing for new projects.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home Prices Are Seen as Far From Bottom</span>
</div><div class="author">By VIKAS BAJAJ; Tara Siegel Bernard contributed reporting.   </div><div>1574 words</div><div>16 October 2008</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 The New York Times Company.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American housing market, where the global economic crisis began, is far from hitting bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices across much of the country are likely to fall through late 2009, economists say, and in some markets the trend could last even longer depending on the severity of the anticipated recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In hard-hit areas like California, Florida and Arizona, the grim calculus is the same: More and more homes are going up for sale, but fewer and fewer people are willing or able to buy them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the worries nationwide are rising unemployment, falling wages and escalating mortgage rates -- all of which will reduce the already diminished pool of would-be buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The No. 1 thing that drives housing values is incomes,'' said Todd Sinai, an associate professor of real estate at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ''When incomes fall, demand for housing falls.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the government's move to bolster the banking industry, home loan rates rose again on Tuesday, reflecting concern that the Treasury will borrow heavily to finance the rescue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the average rate for 30-year fixed rate mortgages was 6.75 percent, up from 6.06 percent last week. While banks are moving aggressively to sell foreclosed properties, the number of empty homes is hovering near its highest level in more than half a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of June, 2.8 percent of homes previously occupied by an owner were vacant. Nearly 1 in 10 rentals was without a tenant. Both numbers are near their highest levels since 1956, the earliest year for which the Census Bureau has such data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the number of people who are losing jobs or seeing their incomes decline is rising. The unemployment rate has climbed to 6.1 percent, from 4.4 percent at the end of 2007, and wages for those who still have a job have barely kept up with inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York and other cities that rely heavily on the financial sector, economists expect that job losses will increase and that pay heavily tied to year-end bonuses will decline significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reliable proxy of housing values -- the ratio of home prices to rents -- indicates that in many cities prices are still too high relative to historical norms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, for instance, home prices are about 22 times annual rents, according to analysis by Moody'sEconomy.com. The average figure for the last 20 years is just 15 times annual rents. The difference between those two numbers suggests that a home valued at $500,000 today might be worth only $341,000 based on the long-term relationship between prices and rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price-to-rent ratio, which provides one measure of how much of a premium home buyers place on owning rather than renting, spiked across the country earlier this decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It increased the most on the coasts and somewhat less in the middle of the country. Economy.com's calculations show that while it remains elevated in many places, the ratio has fallen sharply to more normal levels in places like Sacramento, Dallas and Riverside, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current housing downturn is much more national in scope and severe than any other in the postwar period, partly because of the proliferation of risky lending practices. Today, foreclosures are running ahead of the downturn in the economy, a reversal of previous housing slumps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are in uncharted waters,'' said Brian A. Bethune, an economist at Global Insight, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colleen Pestana, a real estate agent in Orange County in California, said many people losing their homes in Southern California used to work at mortgage and real estate companies. Many of them bet heavily on real estate by upgrading to bigger houses every few years. Now, many are losing their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Ms. Pestana said, her clients who are looking to buy are having a harder time lining up financing. One of her clients recently had to give up on a home after the lender that had offered a pre-approved loan changed its mind -- a frequent occurrence, according to real estate agents and mortgage brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am working harder than I have ever had to work to get a deal together and keep it together,'' said Ms. Pestana, who has been a real estate agent for seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To cushion themselves from potential losses if homes lose value, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the mortgage finance companies that the government took over in September, have increased fees on loans made to borrowers who have good but not excellent credit records, even those who are making down payments as big as 30 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those higher fees are generally invisible to borrowers because banks factor them into mortgage interest rates. While the national average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now 6.75 percent, according to HSH Associates, mortgage brokers say the rates for many borrowers in the Southwest or Florida can be as high as 8 percent, especially for so-called jumbo loans that are too big to be sold to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. (Those loan limits vary by area from $417,000 to roughly $650,000.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher interest rates result in bigger monthly payments, pricing some potential buyers out of the market. For example, monthly payments are $2,700 on a 6 percent 30-year, fixed-rate loan of $450,000. If the interest rate rises to 7 percent, those monthly payments jump to $3,000. All things being equal, when rates rise prices generally fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, Fannie and Freddie canceled a fee increase that would have applied to markets where home prices are falling, but the companies still have many other fees in place. In an effort to help drive down rates, the Treasury Department has announced plans to buy mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie and Freddie. The government also recently increased the amount of loans the companies can buy and hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, those efforts will take time to have an impact and it is not clear whether they will be sufficient to get banks to lend more freely, especially in areas where jumbo loans make up a bigger percentage of lending, like New York and parts of California and Florida. Economists say that prices in those places will probably fall further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some of those places, price declines are being driven by a sharp increase in sales of foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hudson &amp; Marshall, a Dallas-based auctioneer that holds sales for lenders, reports that banks are accepting prices that they refused to consider just 12 months earlier. In a recent auction of 110 foreclosed homes in the Las Vegas area, for instance, the auctioneer's clients accepted 90 percent of the bids submitted by buyers, up from 60 percent a year earlier, said David T. Webb, a co-owner of the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home prices in Las Vegas have already fallen 34 percent from their peak in the summer of 2006, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller home price index. Prices in San Diego have fallen 31 percent since late 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While those declines have been painful to homeowners in those cities, economists said the quick decline might help the markets reach bottom faster than in previous housing cycles, said Edward E. Leamer, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles. In a previous boom, home prices peaked in the Los Angeles area in 1990 but did not hit bottom until 1996. Prices remained near that low for more than a year before starting to climb again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In some areas of California, we are really at appropriate levels,'' Mr. Leamer said of current home prices. But he added: ''The risk is that we are going to get some overshooting, meaning that prices will be lower than they ought to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Florida, Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant, said that while some cities, like Fort Myers, are showing tentative signs of a rebound, others like Miami and Fort Lauderdale are still under pressure. Two homes on his street in Fort Lauderdale that sold for about $730,000 apiece in 2005 recently sold for $400,000 -- a 44 percent decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The rocket has run out of fuel, and now it's plunged back down to earth,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Pending home sales rose 7.4 percent from July to August, an industry group said Wednesday in an unexpected piece of positive news for the battered housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group, the National Association of Realtors, said its seasonally adjusted index of pending sales for existing homes rose to 93.4 from an upwardly revised July reading of 87. The reading was the highest since June 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are considered pending when the seller has accepted an offer but the deal has not yet closed. Typically there is a one- to two-month lag before a sale is completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street economists surveyed by Thomson IFR had predicted the index would fall to 84.9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index, which sunk to a record low of 83 in March, stood at 85.8 in August 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales are picking up in places where housing prices have declined severely, including Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada and Rhode Island and the Washington, D.C., area, said Lawrence Yun, the association's chief economist. Still, Mr. Yun does not expect home prices to rebound until next year and expects only a modest gain -- 2 to 3 percent -- in 2009.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of houses, apartments and mobile homes in the nation rose by almost four million from 2005 to 2007, to 128.2 million, according to a survey the Census Bureau released on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 3 percent of housing units were occupied by three generations of the same family, the survey found, and 27 percent by people living alone. Renters occupied 32 percent and owners 68 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the total number of housing units, 6.3 million were manufactured or mobile homes and 6.4 percent were co-ops. The vast majority, 80 million, were detached single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data, included in the 2007 American Housing Survey, does not account for the full impact of plummeting prices since the subprime and credit crises struck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the survey suggests one possible cause for the difficulty in meeting monthly housing costs: Among owners who reported making a down payment on the homes they occupied, about a third put down only 6 percent or less of the purchase price. Among black homeowners, about half made down payments of less than 6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing costs consumed 24 percent of income over all. Those costs were 13 percent for owners without a mortgage, 28 percent for co-op residents with a mortgage and 33 percent for renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the more than 75 million homes occupied by their owners, one in three had no mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home value over all rose about 16 percent to $191,471, from $165,344 in 2005, a slightly smaller percentage gain than the two-year increase from $140,201 after 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of houses and apartments valued at over $300,000 soared more than 20 percent since 2005. The 2007 survey found more than four million occupied homes valued at $750,000 and up and another 92,000 for sale at those prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median monthly housing costs in 2007 were $927 for owners and $755 for renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Housing Survey, conducted by the Census Bureau for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, also found more homes in communities that are gated or have rules against younger residents, compared with 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More homes had a usable fireplace than a working carbon monoxide detector, and more had a garage than a dishwasher. About 86 percent were air-conditioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median size of all single, detached and manufactured or mobile homes rose slightly since 2005, to 1,769 square feet (and to 2,304 for homes built in the previous four years). The median amount of space per person also increased, to 769 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey's 600-pages of tables detail wide disparities based on race, ethnicity, income and location in the rates of home ownership, physical condition of dwellings, satisfaction with neighborhoods and dozens of other variables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents of about 15 percent of homes and apartments said a serious crime had occurred in their neighborhood in the preceding year, although 90 percent said they were satisfied with police protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with 2005, fewer windows were protected by bars, but more were boarded up or broken, another possible consequence of foreclosure and abandonment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among households with small children, more than 60 percent said the children attended a satisfactory public elementary school. Occupants of about one in four housing units gave their neighborhood the top rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 23 percent had complaints of annoying street noise or heavy traffic. People living in 18 million homes said their neighbors were noisy, but 72 percent described the noise as not bothersome.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the national housing market is suffering and jobs on Wall Street are being lost every day, Manhattan real estate prices are higher now than they were a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a Manhattan apartment rose slightly to $1.5 million in the third quarter of this year compared with the same period last year, propelled largely by a few purchases at the high end of the market, according to reports released yesterday by four large real estate brokerages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the average price has fallen from the first quarter, when it reached $1.7 million. And data tracked by the brokerages indicates that the market has slowed: there are fewer sales than in the last five years, there are more apartments for sale now than in the past eight years, and more sales contracts are being canceled. Even the pace of growth for luxury apartments, long the strongest segment of the Manhattan market, has slowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have great concern about 2009,'' said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel Incorporated, the real estate research company tracking these numbers for the brokerage Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''At some point, you're going to see prices erode.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports, which track deals made by buyers who went to contract before the national financial crisis of recent weeks, showed that the average sales price was 8 percent higher than at this time last year, according to data tracked by Miller Samuel. The increase was driven at least partly by closings in the last quarter on four Upper East Side co-ops for more than $30 million each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers predict that real estate prices are unlikely to drop as much as they have in other parts of the nation because the market is filled with co-op owners who have more equity in their properties and because there is a limited supply of apartments in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You will start to see a softening in prices over the next two quarters, but it's not going to be dramatic,'' said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. ''The predictions of a full-scale drop in New York will not happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is already a pretty drastic decline from the beginning of this year. At that time, the record was attributed to a large number of condo sales at buildings like 15 Central Park West and the Plaza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of multimillion-dollar closings has become smaller, but is still significant. The number of apartments that closed in those two buildings dropped to 34 in the third quarter from 81 in the second quarter, according to Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for the brokerages Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these numbers do not reflect the impact of the latest financial crisis, because they track deals that were in the works for many months. It is also too soon to know whether people facing financial trouble will have to sell their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to be some time to process what happened,'' Mr. Heym said. ''It's not like 35,000 people were given pink slips and have to sell their apartments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the stock market crash of 1987, it took two years for Manhattan real estate prices to drop, according to Mr. Miller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they did drop, the market became more troubled because the slowdown coincided with developers taking advantage of tax incentives to build thousands of new apartments. At the same time, thousands of rentals were being converted into co-ops. Many builders had concentrated on building only smaller apartments that were attractive to investors looking to rent them out. All of this inventory meant that it took until the mid-1990s for prices to recover from overbuilding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the city has experienced a building boom in the last several years, brokers and data trackers say that the market is in better shape because fewer units have been built and developers have designed a greater mix of apartment sizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had a huge abundance of investor-type apartments,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property. ''We don't have that now. Our inventory has been so well thought out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for apartments of certain sizes and in certain neighborhoods have held their value, and in some cases have thrived. Apartments along Park Avenue on the Upper East Side have had their median sales price jump by 57 percent, and the average price of an Upper East Side apartment with four or more bedrooms jumped by 95 percent, while other apartments in the neighborhood saw small price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales prices for downtown apartments remained flat except for apartments with three bedrooms or more, which dropped by 19 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer apartments are selling than in the last five years. Data tracked by <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> showed that the number of apartments that closed dropped to 2,982 sales in the third quarter, compared with nearly 4,976 at the same time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Manhattan apartments sitting on the market is higher than it has been in the past eight years, according to <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. By last month, the number of listings had grown to 10,761 from 8,444 in September 2007. At the same time, far fewer of those apartments actually sold. Just 727 listings were absorbed in September 2008 compared with 858 in September 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers have grown so concerned that they started to back out of deals. In September, the number of New Yorkers who canceled contracts jumped by nearly 40 percent, affecting 130 contracts, according to the real estate Web site StreetEasy.com, which also released a report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Miller, the key indicator to watch in the coming months is Manhattan's inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we're going into this weaker period of housing, we're going in at a relatively low level of inventory,'' Mr. Miller said. ''But inventory could rise fairly quickly if the level of sales continues to remain low.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WARHOL paintings have been selling for tens of millions of dollars. But that same kind of sales success is not happening with Warhol-branded real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Upper East Side town houses once owned by Andy Warhol have lingered on the market since the spring. Earlier this month, as Wall Street investment houses were tottering, prices of both houses were slashed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers are now wondering whether the reductions are part of a wave of price trims on houses and apartments priced too extravagantly in the spring (a time when luxury prices were still rising), or whether they represent a sober reconsideration of the value of celebrity in the current real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These were vanity prices; sooner or later they would have cut them anyway,'' said one broker, who did not want to be identified criticizing a colleague. ''There are no Warhols painted on the walls.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1974 until his death in 1987, Warhol lived at 57 East 66th Street, in a deep 20-foot-wide house built in 1910. According to the listing by Deborah Grubman and Carol Cohen of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, the six-and-a-half-story house, between Madison and Park Avenues, is completely renovated and equipped with an elevator. The original asking price of $38.5 million has been trimmed by 9 percent, to $35 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before moving to 66th Street, Warhol lived with his mother at 1342 Lexington Avenue, at East 89th Street, where he developed his breakthrough Pop Art in the 1960s. The asking price was $5.99 million in a listing by Lawrence Comroe of Corcoran. It was cut by a third, to $4 million. Brokers on both houses declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first half of 2008 had record sales of apartments over $4 million, leading brokers to price newly available properties ever higher, only to pull back this fall. A review of apartment closings suggests that the number of sales in the third quarter, which ends this week, will be up slightly from the second quarter, with average prices off by about 6 percent and median prices by about 7 percent. (Figures exclude the Plaza on Fifth Avenue and Central Park South and 15 Central Park West at 62nd Street.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that despite the national financial crisis, luxury buyers continue to show up for open houses and to sign sales contracts, even for $20 million-plus apartments.</p>

</div><div class="author">By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   </div><div>403 words</div><div>26 September 2008</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>The New York Times on the Web</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New home sales tumbled in August to the slowest pace in 17 years, while the average sales price fell by the largest amount on record, demonstrating the depth of the problem that Washington is trying to solve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Thursday that new homes sales fell by 11.5 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 460,000 units, the slowest sales pace since January 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a much bigger sales decline than the small 1 percent drop that economists had been expecting. The average price of a new home sold in August dropped by a record amount of 11.8 percent to $263,900, compared to the July average of $299,100. The median price was also down, falling 5.5 percent to $221,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big drop in new home sales followed news Wednesday that sales of existing homes were down 2.2 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.91 million units. Both segments of the market remain under pressure from the steepest housing downturn in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That housing slump has contributed to a record surge in mortgage defaults, leading to billions of dollars in losses by financial firms and spawning a severe credit crisis that is threatening to send the country into a steep recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a nationally televised speech Wednesday night, President Bush said the credit crisis could trigger a ''long and painful recession'' unless Congress acts quickly to pass a $700 billion bailout plan for the nation's financial system. Negotiations on that plan were continuing Thursday with expectations that an agreement would be reached soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the weak housing report, the government said Thursday that new claims for unemployment benefits shot up last week to the highest level in seven years. Orders to factories for big-ticket manufactured goods fell by a much-bigger-amount than expected amount of 4.5 percent in August. Both indicate the rising pressures facing the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report on new home sales showed that business was off in every region of the country except the Midwest, which posted a 7.2 percent increase. Sales plunged by 36.1 percent in the West and were down 31.9 percent in the Northeast. Sales fell a more modest 2.1 percent in the South.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A decline in home prices in August attracted more buyers in some areas and led to a sizable decline in the number of unsold homes on the market, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price fell 9.5 percent, to $203,100, the largest price decline on records dating to 1999. As prices fall, buyers are taking advantage of steep discounts, especially in hard-hit markets like California, Nevada and Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Time and price are the real cures for the housing market slump,'' said Mike Larson, an analyst at Weiss Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of unsold homes fell 7 percent, to 4.3 million, down from the record of 4.6 million in July. That's a 10.4-month supply at the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline, however, merits only ''a small round of applause'' because about five months of inventory is a more typical level, wrote a Global Insight economist, Patrick Newport. Also, many homeowners who don't have to sell are probably keeping their properties off the market. At the same time, thousands of foreclosed properties are tied up in court and are not for sale yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories have been driven higher by a large wave of mortgage foreclosures, especially on risky loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors say they hope the government's takeover of the mortgage finance companies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, combined with a huge plan to purchase distressed mortgage securities on Wall Street, will ultimately make it easier for homebuyers to get mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with credit remaining tight and foreclosures still surging, ''home prices are likely to decline considerably further in the quarters ahead,'' wrote Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making matters worse for buyers, mortgage rates, which fell after the takeover of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, have been creeping back up amid uncertainty over how the government's intervention in financial markets would play out. New applications for home loans fell 10.6 percent last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales fell in August to a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.91 million units, down 2.2 percent from an upwardly revised pace of 5.02 million in July. Sales were down almost 11 percent from August last year. Without adjusting for seasonal factors, sales were down 15 percent from year-ago levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While buyers are attracted to lower prices, especially in places like California, Florida and Nevada, sales are sluggish in formerly stable markets like the Pacific Northwest and Charlotte, N.C., Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of home sales fell from July to August in the Northeast, where they dropped 6.6 percent, and the West, where sales declined 5.3 percent. Sales rose by less than 1 percent from July to August in both the Midwest and South.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Lennar Corporation</span>, one of the nation's largest home builders, said Tuesday its quarterly loss narrowed sharply as it cut costs, but revenue fell by more than half amid the prolonged housing slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's loss for the quarter was $89 million, or 56 cents a share, compared with a loss of $513.9 million, or $3.25 a share a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue in the period, which ended Aug. 31 and was the third quarter of Lennar's fiscal year, fell 53 percent, to $1.11 billion from $2.34 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Completed sales of homes fell 49 percent in the quarter, and the average sale price of homes fell 9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While we expected the housing market to remain constrained throughout the third quarter, the weakness in the market actually accelerated as a result of increased foreclosures, weakened consumer confidence and tightened mortgage lending standards,'' the chief executive, Stuart A. Miller, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said that the housing stimulus bill enacted in July, which included a temporary $7,500 tax credit for first-time home buyers, failed to stabilize the decline in home prices. He said more government intervention was needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar has home-building operations in 14 states, including California and Florida, the hardest-hit housing markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the quarter, Lennar delivered 3,791 homes, down from 7,636 in the comparable period last year. The sharpest drop occurred in Western markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average sale price of homes delivered fell to $270,000 as the builder cut prices or offered incentives, like discounts matching the $7,500 tax credit for first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, Lennar offered sales incentives amounting to $45,900 a home delivered during the quarter. That compares with incentives valued at $46,000 a home delivered a year earlier. New orders totaled 3,387 homes, down 42 percent from last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF the New York real estate market totters, the shock waves will most likely be felt first in those newly fashionable neighborhoods like Harlem and the outer reaches of Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Harlem, condominium and town house prices have already been in something of a pause, with prices off their peaks and a lingering inventory of unsold new condos. But as skeptical buyers become more discerning, well-finished apartments in good locations continue to sell so far, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month William Rohlfing, who redevelops town houses in Harlem, got $2.33 million for what was once an 18-foot-wide shell, at 737 St. Nicholas Avenue and West 147th Street. He had transformed it into a modern space with bare brick walls and a fish pond framed by a central open staircase. The pond was an amenity for the buyers, Michael Shen and Corrine Abate-Shen, both medical researchers at Columbia University. (Mr. Rohlfing paid $775,000 for the shell in 2005).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But consider two other unfinished town houses. In March 2007, a 19-foot-wide house divided into three units on 158 West 130th Street sold for nearly $1.9 million, with 90 percent covered by two mortgages. Nearly a year later it was back on the market for $2.6 million, according to Streeteasy.com. Since then the asking price has been cut five times; when the house went into contract in July, the price was $1.5 million. At 2107 Fifth Avenue at 129th Street, a brownstone sold for $1.09 million in late 2006, and now, after a price cut, is being offered for $1.05 million. It had $1.3 million in mortgages. The listing, by David Daniels of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, reads, ''The interior of this near shell has already been demo'd for you and prepped for work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lenox Grand, a new condo development on Lenox Avenue at West 129th Street, is being reintroduced, complete with newly redesigned lobby, hallways and rooftop space, and a new broker, Warburg Realty. Prices have been cut. The sponsor is now providing financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lenox, a tan brick building with large windows and 19 apartments, was begun in 2005, but was delayed when the developer ran into financing trouble. Initial buyers were given a chance to back out, and many did. In fact, only three hung on, according to Michael Davis, a consultant with the Plymouth Group, which was hired to help rejuvenate the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two new buyers have since signed contracts, and three more units have contracts out, Mr. Davis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Willie Kathryn Suggs, a Harlem broker, put it: ''The market didn't tank, it flattened. The poor brokers are working four times as hard for the same money.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Construction of new homes and apartments fell to the lowest level in 17 years last month, showing that the country is still gripped by a severe housing downturn that has brought on billions of dollars of losses and is reshaping the nation's financial industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that housing construction dropped a surprising 6.2 percent in August, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 895,000 units. It was the slowest construction rate since January 1991, another period when housing was going through a painful correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline is larger than the 1.6 percent drop that analysts had expected, and it showed weakness everywhere in the country except the West. The data was bound to shake Wall Street, already rattled by a crisis in the financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing downturn has depressed overall economic activity and pushed the country close to a recession. Thousands of construction jobs have been lost, contributing to an economic slowdown that drove the overall unemployment rate to a five-year high of 6.1 percent in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline last month in housing reflected a 1.9 percent decline in construction of new single-family homes, which fell to an annual rate of 630,000 units. Construction of multifamily units fell 15.1 percent to an annual rate of 265,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction over all was down in all parts of the country with the exception of the West. Construction fell 14.5 percent in the Northeast, 13.6 percent in the Midwest and 7.4 percent in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the declines left construction activity 33.1 percent below the level of a year ago. Analysts believe that construction will continue falling for many more months as builders struggle to reduce the backlog of unsold homes in a sluggish market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, considered a good indicator of future activity, dropped 8.9 percent in August to an annual rate of 854,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the nation's current account deficit widened to $183.1 billion during the second quarter, from $175.6 billion in the first quarter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS the fall real estate season gets under way, buyers and sellers will have to contemplate a market in which average prices have begun to drift modestly lower and the national economic mood is grim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A review of closing co-op and condominium prices in July and August shows average Manhattan closing prices off 7 percent in the third quarter to date, and median prices off 6 percent, compared with the previous quarter, but above the levels of a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These figures exclude sponsor sales at two hugely expensive condo projects -- 15 Central Park West at West 62nd Street, and the conversion of the Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenue -- that have driven up average prices in the last few quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers said that over all, well-priced apartments were continuing to sell. Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said his brokerage firm was finding that prices were essentially flat. The number of deals his firm was doing was off 16 percent compared with the same time last year, he said, but with prices up over the same period, the total value of sales was ''only down a couple of percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michele Kleier, the president of Gumley Haft Kleier, a Manhattan brokerage firm, says overpriced apartments that came on the market last spring are still lingering, while sellers are spending more time staging apartments and buyers are taking more time to make decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over the summer, there was something of a reverse 15 Central Park West effect: there was a surge in sponsor sales of lower-priced apartments in less expensive neighborhoods, like Lower Manhattan, Harlem and East Harlem. This would have the effect of lowering average and median prices somewhat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surge in sales of one-bedrooms and studios and other lower-priced apartments appeared concentrated in relatively few buildings. There were 333 transactions for less than $1 million in 16 buildings, including 47 transactions at the Kalahari, a condominium at 40 West 116th Street in Harlem, and 46 at 90 William Street in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In East Harlem, David Petterson, who owns a Web design business, and his girlfriend, Veni Ercegovic, who works in the fashion industry, paid $525,000 for an apartment on the eighth floor of the Aura, a new condominium at 330 East 109th Street. They are among 14 buyers who paid less than $1 million for apartments there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Petterson said ''it was an upgrade'' from a studio on the Upper East Side to a one-bedroom with a balcony in a sleek modern building of glass and brick with a gym and a garden with a hot tub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, an appraiser who prepares market reports for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said the decline in aggregate prices was a combination of seasonal trends and weaker conditions. But he said he was worried that the market might deteriorate next year, if the economy weakened and Wall Street bonuses were cut sharply.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A FEW years ago in New Jersey, housing complexes for those 55 and older were proliferating, with new projects seeming to pop up and sprawl out nearly anyplace with acreage -- be it urban, suburban or rural.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing slump persists, however, the bloom is off the rose for the ''active adult'' sector -- perhaps even more so than for the overall market. One factor may be the disinclination of would-be buyers to lower their price expectations on the houses they have lived in for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Otteau of the Otteau Appraisal Group is offering brokers and developers new data showing reduced demand for such housing around the state, and a large inventory of unsold units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Rivervue at Hoffman's Marina project in Brielle, the original price range on 14 new units was $900,000 to $2.2 million. But earlier this year, after half had been sold, the remaining seven were made available in the $675,000 to $1.2 million range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month at Rivervue, a ''live free for one year'' deal was instituted and led to three quick sales of remaining units, said Tom Neumaier, the marketing director for the builder, the Robertson <span class="companylink">Douglas Group</span>. Under the program, buyers who provide a down payment of 25 percent are guaranteed that their mortgage payments, taxes, association fees and all other costs will be paid for the following 12 months, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Given the problem of purchasers who have an existing home to sell in a slow market, and who are trying to avoid a double mortgage payment, we came up with this idea to give them peace of mind,'' Mr. Neumaier said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, he said, would-be buyers with a house on the market are advised that ''an existing home that is priced right will sell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have found a lot of people struggling with what has happened to the value of an existing home over the past two years, making them reluctant to make the move as empty nesters,'' he said. ''But what we try to help them understand is that prices are also down on the new house they will buy, and they will really come out O.K.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Fenichel, a spokesman for the developer K. Hovnanian Homes, said that since buyers over 55 had most likely owned their homes for a long time, they should have built up enough equity to ''price it competitively when they put it up for sale, and still make some money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Schneier, the president of <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span>' metropolitan New York-New Jersey division, made the same point in explaining why sales this year at his company's Wanaque Reserve by Del Webb complex, in Bergen County, had exceeded 2007 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This community attracts many buyers from Bergen County and Rockland County,'' Mr. Schneier said. ''These are affluent areas where people already own homes in prime locations, and have probably built a lot of equity in those homes, and won't have as much of a problem selling them to move to Wanaque.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, Mr. Otteau said it was clear that virtually all developers of age-restricted housing had significantly reduced asking prices for their units over the last two years. Several developers -- although not K. Hovnanian -- conceded that to be true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market reports indicate that sales are lagging, inventory is swollen and an increasing number of older home owners are choosing to ''age in place,'' as Mr. Otteau put it, meaning they will remain in their homes awhile longer with the hope that the market will shift and values will again rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau said he knew of nine planned projects that had been scrapped because of weak market conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, developers and builders may tend to disagree about whether their individual projects might be in trouble, and some can point to certain projects where sales are hot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just last month, said Don Bompensa, a Lennar company executive, there were people sleeping in the parking lot overnight to be the first to make offers on 25 new units being built alongside the golf course at Greenbriar Oceanaire in Waretown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are honestly not surprised,'' said Mr. Bompensa, president of Lennar's New Jersey division. ''We've been developing this premier active-adult community since 2001, and have sold more than 900 of the 1,400 single-family homes to date -- including 27 in the month of August alone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, K. Hovnanian, which developed the Four Seasons brand of over-55 condominiums, announced last week that it had begun construction of several dozen new two-bedroom two-bath units at the Four Seasons at Great Notch community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement had been preceded by another less positive one from the publicly held K. Hovnanian: On Sept. 3, it reported its eighth consecutive quarterly loss. But at Great Notch, sales have continued to be relatively lively, said Sean Mulhall, the community manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other K. Hovnanian executives cited a pent-up demand for over-55 housing priced in the low $400,000's, particularly at Great Notch, which is only 12 miles from Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Active-adult communities is one of the only segments of the market where we are adding units,'' said Mr. Fenichel of K. Hovnanian, ''because they're selling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that optimism aside, Mr. Otteau cited several recent instances in which developers had asked local authorities to lift, or at least ease, age restrictions for projects approved as ''active adult.'' In consideration of poor market conditions, he said, restrictions were dropped at projects in Bound Brook, Hackettstown, Maplewood, Fort Lee and Morris Township.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you own a second home in Door County, you probably have National Geographic magazine to thank,'' said <span class="companylink">Scott Bader</span>, a broker at Coldwell Banker Door County Horizons in Fish Creek, Wis. ''In the early 1960s, they published an article on the area, and tourism went crazy. Real estate took off from there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Door Peninsula, made up of all of Door County and parts of two other counties, reaches into Lake Michigan in northeast Wisconsin, forming Green Bay. With its coves and harbors, Door County has about 300 miles of coastline. ''Some people call it the Cape Cod of the Midwest,'' Mr. Bader said. ''We call Cape Cod the Door County of the Northeast.'' Boating is a major draw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area's second-home population is fed by cities like Chicago, Minneapolis and St. Paul, Milwaukee and Madison, Wis. Sturgeon Bay, a city with about 10,000 full-time residents, serves as an anchor city for smaller second-home and vacation communities including Fish Creek, Sister Bay, Egg Harbor, Washington Island, Jacksonport, Ephraim and Baileys Harbor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, prices reflect nearness to the water. ''But people buying inland in search of greater acreage has driven inland prices up in recent years,'' said Mr. Bader, who has been selling real estate in the area for 23 years. Buyers choose between the shorelines of Lake Michigan and Green Bay, which doesn't have as much sand beach but is good for boating and has warmer water. Typically, waterfront on Green Bay sells for more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the high end, Door County prices cluster in the range of $1 million to $2 million, though properties have sold for $4 million or more. For a three-bedroom cabin in the woods, an average price is about $250,000. A similar house with a water view would list at around $500,000. Directly on the shore, the price would rise to $750,000. The average price for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom condominium with a garage is about $275,000. On the shore, similar condominiums average just over $600,000 and can cost well over a million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EARLIER this summer, Constantine M. Rose and Maria Gizas accomplished the American dream at age 25: Having saved enough money for a down payment by living with their respective families for two years, they bought their first home, a one-bedroom condominium in a lavishly marbled converted school building in Hoboken for $360,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As first-time home buyers, I think we lucked out in terms of what's going on with the housing market,'' said Mr. Rose, an accountant, who proposed to Ms. Gizas, an advertising copy writer, days after signing the purchase agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't have to take a hit on an existing property we had to sell,'' he said, ''and we benefited from lowered prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the latest figures on the market for houses priced at ''entry level'' -- in New Jersey, that would be $400,000 or less -- do peg this as a propitious moment for buyers, if they can just qualify for a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moment, however, is likely to last only about another six months, said Jeffrey Otteau, a market analyst whose Otteau Appraisal Group monitors statewide sales data and provides monthly reports to the real estate industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He predicted that by next spring the subprime lending crisis, which primarily affects the lower-priced end of the market, will come to an end with the automatic resetting of interest rates on the final round of subprime loans made two years before. Wary lenders will then begin to loosen purse strings again to higher-leverage buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first-time buyers' market will be the first sector to show dramatic improvement, and the first where prices will begin to rise,'' Mr. Otteau said, ''probably in 2009.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During any slump, he explained, the first-time buyers' market remains much stronger than the overall market, with prices proportionately higher and a livelier sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is because the supply of homes under $400,000 is relatively small in New Jersey, while demand from first-time buyers remains unwaveringly high ''no matter what the economy is doing,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What warped the pattern over the past couple of years, Mr. Otteau added, was the tightening credit for lower-income buyers. He pointed to current sales data showing that the overall inventory of unsold homes statewide represents a 10.9-month supply, while the inventory of unsold homes priced below $400,000 amounts to a 10.2-month supply, which he termed only a ''slight'' difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In both Essex and Hudson Counties, the unsold inventory of the lowest-price homes was actually greater than the rest of the inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is direct evidence of how the credit crunch is disproportionately affecting the first-time market,'' he said. ''Essex and Hudson Counties contain cities that are more urbanized, with higher concentrations of potential first-time buyers of lower-priced homes -- and what they need first and foremost is financing, which has been increasingly hard to come by.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for those who, like Mr. Rose and Ms. Gizas, are able to qualify for a mortgage, the situation is excellent. Prices and interest rates are still low, and supply is unusually abundant in the price range for a first-time buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Schoner, a vice president of Coldwell Banker's new homes division, said his company was marketing more than 25 developments around the state with units priced below $400,000. ''The quandary for the first-time home buyer,'' he said, ''is do they desire an urban setting, more convenient to the workplace, or possibly a bigger home in a more rural area?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quickly running down a list of new construction projects, Mr. Schoner mentioned the Ardan House in Union City, a 12-unit structure ''with all the trimmings'' and a five-minute commute to Manhattan. It will be opening its two-bedroom apartments priced at $350,000 in September. ''There are already 100 people on the waiting list,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bayonne, at the Carlton Tower, a rental building being converted to condos, one- and two-bedroom units are available for $150,000 to $250,000, he said. In Newark, on Ferry Street in the Ironbound section, 68 two- and three-bedroom apartments start in the low $300,000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Vikram Arjuva, a 28-year-old computer software programmer who is married and has a year-old child, bought a four-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath town home in Burlington County, at American Property Realty's Heritage at Chesterfield, for $370,000. The house has 2,400 square feet of living space, a one-car garage, a two-story foyer and granite countertops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I did not go to look for a house when the market was booming,'' Mr. Arjuva said. ''We were renting in South Brunswick, but then I saw it come -- a good buyer's market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Mr. Rose in Hoboken, Mr. Arjuva does not think he will remain in his starter home forever (Mr. Rose's time limit was ''five years, maximum''), but he does think he will be there long enough for its value to increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market will come back because that is what it always does,'' Mr. Arjuva said. ''For now, we are living in our own home, new construction, a peaceful neighborhood and plenty of space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: BUYING MADE EASIER: With no house to sell before they could buy, Constantine Rose and Maria Gizas snapped up a one-bedroom in a converted school building in Hoboken.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest economic indicators, released on Tuesday, showed that manufacturing shrank in August while construction spending fell more than economists had expected in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A private research group, the Institute for Supply Management, said Tuesday that its reading for the nation's manufacturers fell to 49.9, from 50 in July. The August number meets economists' predictions, according to the consensus estimate of Wall Street economists surveyed by Thomson/IFR. A reading below 50 signals contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's inflation index hit a six-month low, however. For the first time in months, costs of many items on the list of commodities were coming down as prices for copper, corn, fuel oil, natural gas and soybean oil fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data show that although inflation remained higher in August, at a reading of 77, it continued to back off its June high of 91.5, the highest since 1979.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readings for new orders, the backlog of orders, inventories and employment all signaled contraction in the sector while readings for exports and production showed expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This continues the 2008 trend toward negligible growth or contraction each month,'' Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the group's manufacturing business survey committee, said in a statement accompanying the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news released Tuesday, the Commerce Department said that construction spending took a bigger-than-expected tumble in July as housing activity dropped to the lowest level in seven years and nonresidential activity fell for the first time in seven months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending declined 0.6 percent in July, double the 0.3 percent decrease analysts had been expecting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing activity fell for a 16th consecutive month, declining 2.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $357.8 billion. That was the lowest level since March 2001, the start of the last recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonresidential activity, which had been offsetting some weakness in the residential sector, also fell in July, dropping 0.7 percent to an annual rate of $416.8 billion. It was the first setback in that category since December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are concerned that nonresidential building will weaken as banks -- battered by big losses on mortgage loans -- tighten lending standards for nonresidential projects as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, construction spending totaled $1.084 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in July. Last month's 0.6 percent drop represented the largest setback since a 0.9 percent decline in February. The government revised the June performance to show a 0.3 percent increase instead of the 0.4 percent decline that had been originally reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction activity is 4.7 percent below the level of a year ago, representing one of the major drags on the current economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For July, the 0.7 percent drop in nonresidential construction followed gains of 1.7 percent in June and 3.1 percent in May. Last month's weakness reflected declines in the construction of factories, power plants, schools and health care operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public construction projects rose by 1.4 percent, to $309.7 billion, in July as spending for federal, state and local building projects rose to record highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending for state and local projects was up 1.2 percent to an annual rate of $285.68 billion, while construction of federal projects rose by 3.9 percent to an annual rate of $24.05 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2.3 percent decline in private housing construction was nearly double the 1.4 percent decline in June and showed that builders were still aggressively trying to cut back to help deal with the worst slump in housing demand in decades. The glut of unsold homes is being worsened by soaring mortgage foreclosures, which are dumping even more properties on the market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI -- For sale: one newly constructed three-bedroom, four-bathroom home near the University of Miami, with South African wood in the kitchen, marble from India, Egypt and Spain, and a $4,500 top-of-the-line garage door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listing price two years ago: $979,000. Listing price now: $599,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I always figured the market trend wouldn't catch me,'' said Rafael Diaz, the owner and builder. He turned down $770,000 more than a year ago, he said, and has come to accept that he will never get the $700,000 he said he needed to break even. ''By the end of the year,'' he said, ''I might just turn it over to the bank.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners are struggling nationwide. But here in South Florida, the reversal of fortune has been especially severe, scrambling the psychology of a community that has historically treated real estate as a game of how-rich-can-you-get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overdeveloped and still building, this remains a place where conversations about the market are sugared with a rush of dreams and speculation. Now, though, people start with ''if only I had sold when,'' rather than ''I should have bought.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values in the Miami area rose reliably for 86 consecutive quarters, or 21 years, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. Then last fall, they started dropping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declines have been significant. The widely respected Case-Shiller index reported last week that prices of previously owned single-family homes in Miami fell by 28.3 percent over the last year, second only to Las Vegas, where home prices dropped 28.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said it could take another year before the local market stabilizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It flew the highest and the farthest during the boom days, and now it is falling the hardest,'' said Michael D. Larson, a real estate analyst with Weiss Research, an investing research firm in Jupiter, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the downward pressure has come from banks trying to offload distressed properties. Foreclosures have received the most attention, but Florida real estate agents also recently added a field in their listings database for ''short sales'' -- properties with an asking price below the amount due on a mortgage, in which the lender often forgives the remaining debt to complete the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of last week, 24 percent of the roughly 34,000 single-family homes for sale in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties -- and 20 percent of the 47,000 condominiums -- were listed as potential short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners trying to compete say they often feel flabbergasted by the competition. Alexandra Swanberg said she reduced the price of her 1,482-square-foot town house to $245,000, from $287,000 last year, to keep up with the dozens of for-sale signs sprouting throughout her middle-class South Miami neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone has been in a panic,'' Ms. Swanberg said. ''The Realtors are crazy; they want you to drop the price really low.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Swanberg, 52, acknowledged that she could afford it. Like many homeowners, the losses of the last few months have not erased the gains of two decades. She said she bought the house 19 years ago for $60,000, and she plans to move to the Orlando area simply because she feels it is time to move on. But when a real estate agent recently told her to cut the price to $225,000, she angrily refused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a large unit, three huge bedrooms, large windows,'' she said. ''This is not something you want to give away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many sellers, the culture of constantly rising real estate prices has been hard to shake, and now a new condition has appeared: seller's regret, or flashbacks to offers past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Swanberg, who works in public relations, has spent a lot of time recalling early offers of around $270,000 that she rejected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Diaz still thinks longingly of his first potential buyer, whose offer of $770,000 he turned down near the end of 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I should have taken it,'' Mr. Diaz said, his voice echoing inside the empty home he visits every few days to clean. ''I guess I was a little cocky, or stupid.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just across the street stood another sign of his self-described ''craziness,'' a two-bedroom bungalow he had planned to tear down to make room for another new home. He had been renting the house for $1,300 a month, but it has been empty since May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is just too much on the market,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, it is common for apartments and homes here to simultaneously be for rent and for sale. And rentals, which have historically made up about a quarter of all transactions in the area, have come to dominate. Roughly two out of every three deals in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale corridor since January have been rentals, according to data from the Florida Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a market reliant on demand for optional second homes, and with prices still falling, buyers have taken on an attitude of wait-and-see. Real estate agents across the region say that the typical purchase now comes only after three months of looking and three months of negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are more qualified buyers sitting on the sidelines than in the 35 years I've been doing this,'' said Ron Shuffield, president of Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors, which has consolidated to 11 offices from 14 because of the downturn. ''We're renting $2 million homes to people who haven't rented a home in 20 years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrea Heuson, a professor of finance at the University of Miami, said the local real estate industry had suddenly been forced to relearn economic lessons long forgotten. ''The 'rent vs. buy decision' is something you used to see in old real estate textbooks; the new ones don't even have it in there because for so long it was obvious that you should buy, not rent,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many owners, like Pasquale Pisana, 38, who works in marketing, have become unexpected landlords. About a year ago, he bought a new two-bedroom condo in downtown Miami for $285,000. He planned to move in as soon as he sold his apartment north of the city, which he put on the market for $349,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no one bought it, he said, though ''we've been close three to five times.'' It is now listed for $238,000. Mr. Pisana still lives there while he rents the new condo downtown for a discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're losing money,'' he said. ''We didn't know it was going to be this bad. We didn't know it was going to be so stressful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are of course winners, too: buyers like Tisha Medina, an inventory manager at a local nursery, who says she looks forward to owning her first home; and real estate agents like Grant Gannon of Urbaniza Realty in Coral Gables, which focuses on short sales and has hired several employees to deal with growing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The very rich also seem to be largely unaffected. Mr. Shuffield at Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell said that nearly a third of his firm's sales this year had been all-cash transactions. Properties selling for more than $1 million, agents said, were far better off than those being sold for $500,000 and below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in some of the recent data, a smattering of good, or less bad, news has appeared. Sales volume, for instance, appears to have stabilized across the state after months of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is not enough for many. After 25 years and 40 or so homes built and sold, Mr. Diaz said he had left real estate for farming. When he is not making sure vandals have not damaged the house that just will not sell he is out in the fields with his fruit trees south of Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the five-acre farm has lost about $200,000 of its value. ''This is the worst time I've ever seen,'' he said. ''This is brutal.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have begun to stabilize as sharply reduced prices lured buyers back into the market in July, according to a pair of reports issued this week. And prices, once plummeting at a breakneck pace, fell in June at a more moderate clip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices will have to keep falling, economists said on Tuesday, before the housing market can make a full recovery. Much of the buying last month stemmed from fire sales of foreclosed homes. And prices are expected to keep sagging under the weight of an enormous backlog of unsold homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, ''it's still a buyer's market, and likely to be so for a while,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist of <span class="companylink">PNC Bank</span>. ''Home buyers are holding all the aces.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report on Tuesday showed that in the 12 months through June, American home values dropped 15.9 percent, the biggest annual decline on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All 20 cities measured in the report, the Case-Shiller index, reported annual declines in June, with seven cities showing price drops of more than 20 percent. A separate 10-city price index, which began in 1988, was off 17 percent, its worst annual reading ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report offered signs that the pace of price declines is slowing. In June, nine cities recorded an increase in home values from the month before, with prices in Boston, Denver and Minneapolis all up at least 1 percent. That compared with increases in seven cities in May. For all 20 cities, prices fell 0.5 percent in June, after a 0.9 percent decline in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that more Americans bought newly built homes in July, with sales up 2.4 percent to an annual pace of 515,000 units, less than the 525,000 expected by economists. The positive sales figure came a day after a private agents' group reported that sales of previously owned homes rose 3.1 percent in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new reports signaled to some analysts that the sharpest corrections in home prices and sales might be over. ''The biggest declines, they're all behind us now,'' said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at Global Insight, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But,'' he added, ''that doesn't mean we're in any sense ready to move up. Or that we're ready for sales to accelerate. Or for prices to flatten out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some buyers may be coming back into the market, many obstacles to a recovery remain. Mortgage rates rose this summer as lenders continued to tighten their standards for issuing home loans. Inventories of previously owned homes rose last month, and foreclosures are expected to continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The supply of homes is going to remain very large for quite some time, and that means prices are far from hitting bottom,'' Mr. Hoffman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence also remains low, which could discourage demand. A survey by the Conference Board, released on Tuesday, showed that confidence was up in August, but still lower than its level in the spring. Among the 5,000 households included in the survey, 3.3 percent of respondents said they planned to buy a home in the next six months, a big increase from the month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists expect that home sales will stay moderately low for an extended period, as buyers wait for prices to fall even further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sales are probably not going to rebound any time soon because the mortgage conditions continue to get tighter,'' Mr. Gault said. He said that the excess supply meant that ''prices have still got to come down some more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 20 cities surveyed in the Case-Shiller index, Las Vegas had the worst annual decline, with values dropping 28.6 percent in the last year. Prices in Miami fell 28.3 percent, and prices in Phoenix dropped 27.9 percent in the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only previously owned, single-family homes are included in the Case-Shiller survey, which economists consider the most reliable indicator of home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes slipped in Midwestern and Southern states, according to the Commerce Department report, but rose in the Northeast and West. The median price of a new home in July was $230,700, down 6.3 percent from a year ago. Sales of new homes remained 35.3 percent below their level in July 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-home sales report is considered volatile by economists, and the government said it had no evidence that the actual change in last month's sales was ''different from zero.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOSTON -- As a wave of home foreclosures courses through the United States, some of the nation's hardest hit cities think they have found a way to ease the blight left on their communities by the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using taxpayer and private money, Boston, Minneapolis, San Diego and a handful of other places are buying foreclosed properties to refurbish and resell them to developers and homeowners in an effort to prevent troubled neighborhoods from sliding into urban decay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The efforts so far have been taken on a small scale. But local officials say they can become an important pillar of any housing recovery with the help of $4 billion in federal grants that were part of a housing bill Congress approved in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the sale of foreclosed homes -- not just to city governments but more broadly to investors and homeowners -- contributed to a 3.1 percent increase in existing home sales in July, the highest level in five months, according to data released on Monday by the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That hardly means that the housing crisis is over, because the number of homes for sale climbed to another record level as more people put their homes on the market. But without buyers taking foreclosed homes at steeply discounted prices, the problem would be even worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some advocates of free markets say those increased sales should address the rising heaps of distressed properties. But many mayors say the market is not moving quickly enough because lenders overwhelmed by foreclosures are not able to sell repossessed properties fast enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many developers and home buyers are also not willing to take a chance on dilapidated properties in distressed neighborhoods. With some homes staying vacant for months or even years, the government, they say, needs to act as an intermediary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a distressed patch of the Dorchester section of Boston, the city recently bought four foreclosed houses on Hendry Street and resold them to a local developer who will refurbish them and put them back on the market. At the same time, the city has increased street cleanings and police patrols, and has hired more social workers to help residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the area was constantly torn by gang violence and chronic joblessness, property prices surged at the height of the housing boom, providing hope of a better future. But the collapse in property values left an unmistakable bruise: The four homes, two of which sold for $550,000 each at the market's peak, were bought for a total of $314,000 by the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standing in front of darkened and boarded up houses, Mayor Thomas M. Menino said these types of interventions would breathe new life into neighborhoods riddled with foreclosed property. ''Our job as the city government is to restore these neighborhoods,'' he said. ''We can't let this cancer continue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents like Luis Rodriguez, a native of the Dominican Republic who earlier bought a fixer-upper across the street, expect the city's efforts to lift real estate values, and earn him a tidy profit if he decides to sell. ''With the mayor's help, I think the neighborhood will be a lot better,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Antonio Goncalves, a 36-year-old electrical worker who lives in the neighborhood, was less sure. He is interested in a home in the area, but the slowdown in construction means that he is not always working full time. ''Even though prices have come down, who knows what is going to happen in two years?'' said Mr. Goncalves, a native of Cape Verde, the island nation off the west coast of Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ailments plaguing parts of Boston are not the same as elsewhere in the country, and each community requires a tailored approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cleveland, Detroit and other places in the Midwest, the effects on neighborhoods from the mortgage crisis are exacerbated by a shrinking population, which is forcing officials to turn to grimmer solutions. Some officials there have concluded that the only way to revitalize certain neighborhoods is to demolish run-down homes and turn the land into small parks or side yards for neighbors who remain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That approach was pioneered by Genesee County in Michigan, which is also plagued by a declining population and a struggling auto industry. It created a land bank to acquire properties on which owners had not paid local taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The land bank has acquired 7,400 properties since it was created in 2002, including about a third of all vacant homes in the county, said Daniel T. Kildee, the county treasurer who oversees the project. The bank has turned 2,500 of them into parks, yards or refurbished homes; it is holding onto the rest until it finds a use for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inspired by Genesee County's success, officials in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includes Cleveland, have asked the state legislature to let local governments create similar land banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Southwest and in Florida, cities whose housing markets are among the worst-hit, are eager to buy foreclosed properties for resale, but must wait for federal money. While long-term prospects in these places are somewhat better because the population is still growing, they face an immediate challenge from a decline in property tax revenue. Many of the hardest-hit areas also are far from job centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Diego, a city grappling with swaths of foreclosures, is better positioned to take a more sweeping approach. Officials there are raising private money to acquire, refurbish and resell hundreds of properties. Investors including the <span class="companylink">California State Teachers' Retirement System</span> and the <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span> bank have committed $20 million so far, said Jim Bliesner, director of the San Diego Reinvestment Task Force, which plans buy its first homes by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This has to be large enough to deal with the problem at scale,'' Mr. Bliesner said. ''We have 14,000 properties in foreclosure. If we fix up four of them, it doesn't make a difference.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The involvement of local governments has not been free from controversy. The White House, for instance, opposed the $4 billion in federal grants. Daniel J. Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, argued that the task of putting families back in foreclosed homes should be left to banks and real estate buyers. The hand of government, he added, would distort the market and siphon capital away from better uses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The more government is involved, the more political and bureaucratic decisions are made,'' he said. ''The more the market is involved, the more efficiency is used.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local officials say they are trying to jump-start the housing market, not supplant it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Minneapolis, some homes in the lower-income north side of the city have been vacant for up to five years. The Greater Metropolitan Housing Corporation has trouble locating officials at mortgage companies who have the authority to sell the properties, said Carolyn E. Olson, president of the group. The effort, which is financed by the city of Minneapolis and the state housing agency, is similar to Boston's approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it has bought 75 homes in an area that had 1,500 foreclosures last year and has about 500 vacant homes; it hopes to do more with the federal grants. Ms. Olson said the group would have to buy and improve only a fraction of the vacant houses, and the market would do the rest. ''You try to strategically do what you think you can and where it will work,'' Ms. Olson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage industry officials acknowledge that they have struggled to deal with the unprecedented number of foreclosed homes. A group of banks has been working on streamlining the process of selling homes to local governments and community groups through the Housing Partnership Network, a Boston-based umbrella group for local community groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> is one of the banks talking with the group. A spokesman said negotiations with cities and community groups often boiled down to a disagreement about home prices. Local officials often want to pay less than what other home buyers will bid. The housing bill, in fact, stipulates that federal money be used only to buy homes at below-market prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to get somebody to buy it and have the house occupied and keep the community moving forward,'' said Thomas A. Kelly, a spokesman for the home lending division of <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>. ''But we have an obligation to our investors to get as high a price as we can.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders and public officials will have to come up with a workable compromise for these nascent efforts to be successful, said Michael A. Stegman, director of policy and housing at the <span class="companylink">MacArthur Foundation</span>, a nonprofit grant-making organization. ''This really is a question of balancing price discounts, losses and prices with what is in the best interest of the community.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Americans waded into the housing market last month, lured by falling prices that helped send sales to their highest level since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least a third of properties bought in July involved foreclosed homes snapped up at bargain-basement prices or homes sold at a loss by owners who had no alternative, according to the private National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These so-called distressed sales helped depress home values across the country, feeding into a downdraft that is making it increasingly difficult for many Americans to sell their homes for more than they paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of previously owned homes were 7.1 percent lower in July than a year earlier, the association reported on Monday, with the median value falling to $212,400, from $215,100 in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there were signs that prices would continue to spiral downward for months to come. The number of homes and apartments for sale jumped 3.9 percent in July, adding to the supply glut that has bedeviled the housing market for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which make up most of the nation's housing supply, rose 3.1 percent in July, the biggest monthly increase since February 2007. Sales are running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of five million units, the fastest in five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures suggested to some economists that the bulk of the decline in home sales had already occurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sales are down substantially from the peak, and they seem to be bouncing around what looks like a bottom,'' said Robert Barbera, chief economist at the research and trading firm ITG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The concern a lot of us have is, relative to last year, a large number of transactions involve houses that have been foreclosed on,'' Mr. Barbera said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's cold comfort to know that the banks are succeeding on selling their houses at prices that are pretty breathtaking,'' he said, referring to banks that have repossessed foreclosed homes from owners who could not pay their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, a big portion of those sales -- 33 percent to 40 percent -- stemmed from properties where owners were forced to sell at a loss, the association said. For many owners, desperation appeared to be driving sales, which means prices are not likely to rise anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, sales of distressed properties made up less than 10 percent of total sales, said Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed sales once accounted for so few transactions that economists for the association did not even measure them as a separate category until this year. But in July, the sales made up their largest percentage to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In places like California or Florida, many of the homes that are listed for sale can be classified as distressed,'' Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And many Americans may be waiting for prices to drop even further. The wave of foreclosures, coupled with tighter lending standards, has scared off many would-be purchasers from the market, which has entered its worst slump in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is still a considerable distance to travel before prices sink to levels necessary to balance supply and demand in the housing market,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief domestic economist at the research firm MFR, wrote in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales last month were 13.2 percent below the 5.76 million annual pace in July 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand may be slightly higher for condominiums and co-op apartments, sales of which rose 3.4 percent in July. Sales of previously owned single-family homes were up 3.1 percent for the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment prices also fared slightly better, declining 2.7 percent from a year ago. The median price fell to $223,400, from $225,900 in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the West, sales were actually higher than they were a year ago, making it the only region in the country with an annual increase. Western sales rose 9.7 percent in July; they were up 5.9 percent in the Northeast, 0.9 percent in the Midwest, and declined 0.5 percent in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales rate, it would take 11.2 months to work off the entire supply of previously owned homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> will release its Case-Shiller home price index for June, considered the most reliable indicator of the nation's home values. The Commerce Department will also release figures for sales of newly constructed homes in July.</p>

</div><div class="author">By MIREYA NAVARRO   </div><div>1694 words</div><div>21 August 2008</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- Candy Spelling, widow of the television producer Aaron Spelling, is downsizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After nearly 20 years in The Manor, a 56,500-square-foot French chateau-style home known for its size and extravagance -- it includes a wine-tasting room, a bowling alley, a silver room, a china room and a well-known gift-wrapping room -- she says she is ready for the next trophy property: a condominium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People say, How can you move from The Manor? There's no place like it,'' Mrs. Spelling said, sitting in the library with leatherbound scripts of every episode of Mr. Spelling's shows, from ''Charlie's Angels'' to ''7th Heaven.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a condo, she said, ''is no different than a house, maybe even better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Spelling is the most conspicuous buyer in an ultraluxury condo market that is new in the sprawl of Los Angeles, where wealth and fame have usually spelled out ''estate,'' not apartment living. But real estate experts say a New York-style luxury high-rise lifestyle is creeping into the wealthiest echelons, fed by trends like people looking to own more than one home, foreigners drawn by the weak dollar to invest in Los Angeles, and new residential buildings being designed by celebrity architects like Robert A. M. Stern, Richard Meier and Jean Nouvel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stern designed The Century, the 140-unit building under construction where Mrs. Spelling recently bought the top two penthouse floors -- 16,500 square feet -- for $47 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's $2,848 a square foot, if you're counting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles is becoming a more vertical area at all income levels as land for development becomes less plentiful and traffic congestion, and now high gas prices, steer more people to cluster around mass transit stations and more community-like sections, like downtown and West Los Angeles, said Delores A. Conway, director of the Casden Real Estate Economics Forecast at the University of Southern California. For 2006 and 2007 in Los Angeles County, condos sold better than single family homes, even as the market was dipping, real estate data shows, although sales above $5 million are still few.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, 59 percent of new home sales were condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The city is becoming more interconnected and growing up,'' Ms. Conway said. ''It's a major change in the landscape of Los Angeles.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And competing to lure the ultra rich out of their grand homes and compounds is a new generation of high-end high-rises, with hundreds of units already under construction or planned that promise a higher level of services and more square footage than the typical luxury condo here, which usually sold for under $10 million. The new pampering, with prices to match, includes restaurants open 24/7, outdoor entertaining spaces and patrols by Israeli-trained security guards to foil the paparazzi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a field of dreams,'' said Stephen Shapiro, chairman of Westside Estate Agency in Beverly Hills, which represents one of the new condo properties. ''Build it, and they hope they will come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Century, a project of Related Companies, the developer of the <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center in New York, sits on three acres of green and offers a 200-foot-long entrance driveway, ''meditation cabanas'' in the gardens, a wine storage and tasting room and guest suites for home offices or household staff. Units go for $3.5 million to $10.5 million and penthouses for $15 million to $29 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not too far away, The Carlyle Residences, a 24-story crescent-shaped building by Elad Properties, owners of the Plaza Hotel in New York, will have 78 units priced at $2.9 million to $20 million when it opens next summer. Among its offerings are a floor dedicated to staff quarters and hedges monitored by security cameras.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is Los Angeles, and the paparazzi problem is so prevalent here,'' explained Jill Eisenstadt, a spokeswoman for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least six projects are going up on the west side between Beverly Hills and Santa Monica alone, including hotels with a residential component. The Montage Hotel Beverly Hills, opening later this year, has 20 condos with hotel services, for $9 million to $32 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've had some terrific demand for them,'' said Alan Fuerstman, founder and chief executive of <span class="companylink">Montage Hotels &amp; Resorts</span>. ''You have all the offerings without the hassles of managing a large estate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Mossler, the real estate agent who sold The Century's first penthouse last December, for $15 million, said the cachet of Mr. Stern was a big draw for his clients, a couple he refused to identify to protect their privacy. They had been looking for a second home in Los Angeles for two years but had not found the looks, privacy or views they wanted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he mentioned a condo, Mr. Mossler said, ''I think they thought I was crazy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I told them about the high quality of the building and the security and the other amenities,'' he said. ''The light went on in their heads. They said, 'It's like a great hotel suite.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mrs. Spelling, 62, mother of the actors Tori and Randy Spelling, the draw was being able to worry less about the upkeep of a house and being ready to travel more two years after the death of her husband, who was afraid of flying, she said. She is entertaining offers in the $150 million range for her W-shaped mansion, which the couple built in the late 1980s in the neighborhood known as Holmby Hills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm looking forward to seeing the world,'' she said. ''I'm now single. My kids don't live at home. It's the next chapter in my life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But going condo can be a challenge when your idea of downsizing does not mean shedding a dining table for 26, or the private pool and rose garden, all of which Mrs. Spelling plans to install in her new digs. Her solution was to combine two duplexes on the 41st and 42nd floors, with 4,000 feet just for the master bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Spelling said she was shrinking her staff of 20 to less than half, three of whom will continue living with her and her wheaten terrier, Madison. She said she was talking to schools and children's hospitals about donating the contents of the library and most of her collection of Madame Alexander dolls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other things -- her china, silver, Impressionist art, wardrobe, wine cellar, ball clock collection and, yes, the gift-wrapping room -- are nonnegotiable, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not giving it up,'' she said of the sometimes ridiculed wrapping room that she calls her ''hobby and therapy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's special to me,'' she said. ''I've always liked my packages pretty.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Spelling said she had also been mindful of her two grandchildren when designing her new condo, which includes a guest suite and pool cabana reserved for their use. The boy and girl are by her daughter, Tori, with whom relations have been rocky, or ''complicated'' as they both have put it. (Mrs. Spelling is completing a book deal that is not meant, she said, as a response to her daughter's best seller, ''Stori Telling,'' which portrayed her as cold and controlling, and which she claimed not to have read.) Despite tabloid reports about their feuds, and about Ms. Spelling's inheriting less than $1 million from her father (Mrs. Spelling said her children and grandchildren would inherit all the Spelling money eventually), Mrs. Spelling said she saw her grandchildren weekly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mrs. Spelling extolled the 360-degree views and amenities of condo life, including a health club with on-call massage service, she said friends were already telling her ''maybe this is what we should do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some developers say the ultraexpensive condo market is still a gamble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The premium condo market is unproven in Los Angeles,'' said Paul Habibi, a developer who also lectures in real estate at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''Amenities are certainly a draw, but are they any better than what they already have?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stern, the architect of The Century, which is going up in Century City, an area with a shopping mall, movie theaters, upscale restaurants and many entertainment offices, said wealthy Angelenos were ready for apartment living as long as they got ''that outdoor-indoor type of living.'' He said Californians, unlike New Yorkers, felt entitled to space, light and fresh air, which he translated into spacious rooms and big balconies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are ready to live in a more urban way,'' Mr. Stern said. ''They're sick of driving everywhere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad economy and soft real estate market do not seem to be affecting the $5 million and up housing segment, brokers said. The Century, which will not open until at least the end of 2009, has sold half of its units, mostly to locals, said David Wine, vice chairman of Related Companies, the project's developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the $2,848 a square foot that Mrs. Spelling paid set a record for Los Angeles, Mr. Wine said, it was still a bargain by New York City standards, where less space in the highest-end condominiums can go for thousands of dollars more than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It gives you comfort,'' Mr. Shapiro, the Beverly Hills real estate agent, who handles sales of $20 million and over, said of Mrs. Spelling's decision. ''Nobody wants to be the first one. She sets the pace.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Facing potential lawsuits by the federal government, developers and landlords in New York City may need to spend tens of millions of dollars to renovate more than 100,000 apartments built since 1991 to comply with federal housing laws barring discrimination against tenants who use wheelchairs, real estate industry officials say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 20 years, residential developers have complied with a city law requiring them to ensure that all the apartments they build are accessible to disabled tenants. Considered path-breaking legislation when it was enacted in 1988, the city law essentially meets the federal requirements of the Fair Housing Act, developers and city officials say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the United States attorney's office in Manhattan has sent letters to about a dozen of the city's most prominent landlords and their architects saying that some of their buildings were ''not accessible to persons with disabilities,'' which would constitute discrimination under the Fair Housing Act. The recipients included Related Companies, the Durst Organization, Rose Associates, Rockrose Development and <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The letters said that doors were not wide enough, and that kitchens and bathrooms were not big enough to allow someone in a wheelchair to maneuver. Also, the letters said, tenants could not install ''grab bars'' to lift themselves in or out of a tub, because the walls had not been reinforced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal prosecutor's office, which began sending the letters in January, has asked owners for meetings, building inspections and all the records of the design and layout of the apartments in specific buildings. Until recently, the real estate industry had hoped that the matter would quietly go away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last week, the United States attorney's office filed a lawsuit against one of the recipients, <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span>, and its architects, charging them with discrimination against disabled people by failing to provide sufficient access at Avalon Chrystie Place, a building on the Lower East Side with 361 apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now other landlords and developers -- virtually everyone who has built an apartment house in New York City since 1991 -- fear they may be next. Along with city officials, they assert that compliance with what is known as Local Law 58 satisfies the standards set by the Fair Housing Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is not limited to these 12 or 13 buildings,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, the industry's powerful lobbying arm. ''If there's a decision that Local Law 58 does not meet the criteria for apartments' being accessible, you could easily argue that every building built since 1991 wasn't built in accordance with the federal guidelines.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Spinola estimates that 100,000 rental apartments have been built since 1991, as well as thousands of condominiums. The cost of renovating bathrooms and kitchens, one developer said, would be ''astronomical.'' Another said that his company was already redesigning apartments for future buildings in ways that would eliminate foyer closets to provide more room for entryways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials, who had scheduled a meeting with federal prosecutors for the day after the suit was filed against AvalonBay, promptly canceled it, furious that they had not been notified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In light of the U.S. attorney's lawsuit, we postponed our meeting so we could assess the matter,'' Martha Mann Alfaro, a deputy chief in the city's Law Department, said in a statement. ''However, we anticipate having productive discussions with the U.S. attorney.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rebekah Carmichael, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney, Michael J. Garcia, declined to comment, saying the office did not confirm or deny the existence of current investigations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward M. Schulman, general counsel for AvalonBay, said the company's housing was ''fully accessible to persons with disabilities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our buildings have been constructed in compliance with New York City's Local Law 58,'' he said. ''We are at a loss to understand why the federal government is suddenly viewing New York City's Local Law 58 as deficient and unsatisfactory.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the landlords and architects enlisted the Bloomberg administration to help push back the federal prosecutors. And the Real Estate Board hired a former federal prosecutor, Sarah L. Shudofsky, to represent them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Durst, co-president of the Durst Organization, described the investigation as ''an incredible waste of government resources.'' The Durst Organization got a letter concerning the Helena, a 600-unit apartment building at 57th Street and 12th Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Kleo King, senior vice president for accessibility services for the United Spinal Association, a nonprofit advocacy group, said that the federal government had never recognized Local Law 58 as an acceptable alternative, or ''safe harbor,'' to federal standards. She said that after Law 58 was in place, the city lowered clearance requirements for bathrooms and began allowing kitchen sink and cooktop installations that did not provide adequate floor space for tenants with wheelchairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just because they were able to get a building permit, it does not mean they complied with Fair Housing,'' said Ms. King, whose organization used to be known as the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association. ''The real point that the Department of Justice is trying to make is that people building these buildings have to look at both laws to make sure that they're in compliance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty years ago, advocates for the disabled hailed the stringent regulations in Local Law 58 while Mr. Spinola denounced it, saying it would drive up housing costs. It required that all new and renovated apartments be made accessible to the disabled, in contrast with federal standards at the time, which required that only 5 percent be accessible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was seen as a breakthrough,'' said Marilyn Saviola, an advocate for the disabled who was part of a group that helped write the city law. ''But it was a hard battle. There was tremendous resistance from the administration, initially, and there was a great deal of resistance from the real estate community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1991, the federal government also raised its requirements for housing accessibility. But there is not a mandatory and uniform set of standards, although the Department of Housing and Urban Development cites the design standards set by the American National Standards Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal investigation in New York began with a 2006 survey by the Fair Housing Justice Center, a nonprofit New York group, covering 14 recently built apartment buildings in Manhattan, including AvalonBay's Chrystie Place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane Houk, executive director of the fair housing center, said that her group found that all 14 buildings had interior apartment doors that were too narrow, 28 and 30 inches, thermostats as high as 63 inches from the floor and a lack of clear floor space in the bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We found that none were in compliance with the Federal Housing Act and referred all the information to the U.S. attorney and briefed HUD,'' she said. ''I do not understand why New York City developers and architects thought they were exempt.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a July 14 letter to the United States attorney's office, however, Michael A. Cardozo, the city's corporation counsel, wrote that the city's law addressed all the features of accessibility required by the law. He acknowledged that it ''does not impose precisely the same requirements,'' but he added that the local law satisfied the intent of the law.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest housing numbers from Zillow, the real estate research firm, are littered with minus signs. The data show that it may be a while yet before the housing downturn changes direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow found that nearly 24 percent of homes sold during the past 12 months sold at a loss. (That includes foreclosures.) And of those who bought homes in the last five years, 29 percent now have negative equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's another big negative: the median home value in the United States fell nearly 10 percent in the second quarter, compared with the same period the previous year. That is the biggest percentage decline since Zillow began collecting data 12 years ago. Out of 165 metropolitan areas surveyed by Zillow, 85 percent are in a declining-value zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes in a few places -- including Austin, Tex.; Mobile, Ala.; and Oklahoma City -- have managed to keep climbing in value. They did not partake of the boom that preceded the bust, and now they are being spared the bitter aftereffects.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in financing multifamily housing projects misstated the average price that buyers are paying for apartment buildings that are being sold by Archstone, a national apartment company. It is $200,000 per unit, not per square foot. Similarly, Tishman Speyer and Lehman Brothers paid $240,000 per unit, not per square foot, when they bought the company last October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Aug 15 2008 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the last huge transactions involving a leveraged buyout of a public real estate company was last year's $22.2 billion acquisition by Tishman Speyer and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> of Archstone-Smith, an apartment landlord with a national portfolio of nearly 88,000 luxury rental units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not long after the deal was announced, the credit markets stalled, and some analysts predicted that the transaction would never be completed because banks were no longer able to sell their loans on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase did close in October, however, but only because the two now-beleaguered mortgage powerhouses -- <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> -- provided $8.9 billion of the financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> have experienced painful losses stemming from the housing crisis; their shares have plummeted and an emergency bailout plan has been enacted in case either government-sponsored company fails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But though financing for multifamily housing, including Archstone, as the national apartment company is now known, represents only a small portion of their multitrillion-dollar business, ''it has been a rare bright spot for both of them,'' said Richard C. Anderson, a senior real estate investment trust analyst at the financial services company BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, both <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, though often associated exclusively with single-family housing, are rapidly increasing their multifamily portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Multifamily started off as a bit player with us, but in recent years it has taken on more importance,'' said Ken Bacon, an executive vice president at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. ''Not everybody's going to own their home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the two mortgage finance giants have helped to make the rental apartment industry the strongest of the publicly traded real estate sectors by providing liquidity that is no longer available through commercial mortgage-backed securities, or C.M.B.S.'s. Neither <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> nor <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> issues mortgages; instead they buy loans from banks, freeing capital to make more loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From January through July, total returns for multifamily REITs rose 16.74 percent, while hotel REITs, for comparison, were down 27.85 percent, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, a trade group. ''One reason that multifamily stocks have done better than other sectors is that they have a capital-raising advantage,'' Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors can no longer rely on the C.M.B.S. market -- in which mortgages are pooled and sliced up according to degrees of risk and then sold to investors as bonds -- because it is at a near standstill. Moody's Investors Service reported that only $12 billion of the securities were issued during the first half of the year, a decline of 91 percent from the corresponding period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The multifamily mortgage business at Fannie and Freddie dropped off significantly during the frenzied years of 2006-7. ''They were more conservative than the Wall Streeters,'' said David Tobin, a principal of Mission Capital Advisors, a loan-sale advisory company. ''In '06 and '07, they were marginalized by the investment banks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During those heady times, lenders were routinely providing loans representing 90 percent or more of a property's value, based on the expectation that rents would keep escalating at a rapid clip. ''We figured if that's what it took to compete, we were going to let them go,'' said Mike May, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bacon said <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> also takes a conservative approach to multifamily financing. ''We have a different business model in our multifamily business than we do on single-family homes,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That model was a reaction to the real estate slump in the early 1990s, when commercial buildings took the biggest hit. The ratio of the average loan to the property's value in <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>'s multifamily portfolio is 67 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the freeze in securitized mortgages has created opportunities. Since June 2007, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>'s multifamily loan portfolio has increased by 26 percent -- to $163 billion from $129.5 billion. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which has $63.8 billion in multifamily loans, bought $8.3 billion worth of new loans in the first half of this year, up from $5.5 billion a year earlier, a gain of 49 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two entities have about one-third of the outstanding multifamily debt, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a lucrative business for them, and they are doing a lot of it for that reason,'' said Cheryl Malloy, a senior vice president at the association. Buried in the midst of last quarter's hemorrhaging -- the two mortgage giants reported losses totaling more than $3 billion -- were modest earnings related to multifamily housing: $70 million for <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and $118 million for <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas M. Bibby, president of the National Multi Housing Council, a trade group for large apartment companies, said Fannie and Freddie have also played an important part in fostering newer types of rental housing -- for the elderly, students and the military.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though both were created to focus mainly on housing for people with low or moderate incomes, their role is not limited to those segments of the market, as the Archstone deal shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> recently announced that it would provide $73.9 million in financing for rehabilitating Linden Plaza, a 1,527-unit income-restricted complex in Brooklyn. But it also agreed recently to buy a $78.3 million loan for a $100 million recapitalization deal for the Pegasus Apartments, a 322-unit luxury building in downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bolstering their claim that they seek to minimize risk is the low delinquency rate of their multifamily portfolios -- 0.04 percent at <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and 0.11 percent (up slightly from 0.09 percent in the first quarter) at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, multifamily loans packaged into commercial mortgage-backed securities have a delinquency rate of 1.278 percent -- which still sounds low but is higher than any other property type, according to Realpoint L.L.C., a research company in Horsham, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> say they did not take on undue risk by helping to finance the highly leveraged acquisition by Tishman Speyer and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> of Archstone, the country's largest apartment landlord (in terms of market and equity capitalization). The company has a well-regarded portfolio in desirable markets, mainly on the East and West Coasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even though rents in Archstone buildings have risen by 5 percent, according to <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, the portfolio has lost value in the current downturn. While apartment REIT shares have risen recently, total returns have declined by 8.56 percent since the Archstone deal was announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> and Tishman Speyer recently said they would take a 25 percent write-down on the investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a private concern, Archstone has been scrambling to shed some of its portfolio to pay down its debt. The company has sold $2.3 billion in assets since the buyout, and has as much as $2 billion worth of properties on the market, said Robert M. White Jr., the president of <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York research company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales price so far has averaged around $200,000 a square foot, $40,000 less than the average price paid by Tishman Speyer and its financial partner, he said. Archstone's executives declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. May of <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said the agency is protected because its Archstone loans are senior debt, meaning that they would be the last to incur losses. ''That deal, from a credit standpoint, was a solid deal for us,'' he said. ''If they are overleveraged, it won't be the senior debt that suffers.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's be honest. No one actually knows when and where the housing market will bottom. Experts have been proclaiming the bottom is now -- this very moment -- since Alan Greenspan notoriously predicted the worst was over way back in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are some signs that might indicate the end is nigh, and those signs paint a picture of what that bottom might look like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York Times asked economists across the country to share the data they use to figure out how much houses in regional markets are overvalued, a calculation that approximates where the bottom may be. Models built on these variables show that while some markets -- such as California -- are on a road to recovery, others -- such as south Florida -- have a way to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These signs cannot possibly tell the whole story, especially since they point more toward where prices should be valued than where they will be. But these measures are nonetheless helpful to anyone buying, selling or borrowing against their home sweet home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anybody who says they know when it's going to end with confidence is delusional,'' said Karl E. Case, an economics professor at Wellesley College and co-creator of the Case-Shiller home price index. ''But yes, you can get a sense of where things are going.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to envision the bottom would be to look back at where prices were five or 10 years ago, before the current price run-up. There are some better ways, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noting that home prices have outpaced inflation in the past, one can calculate how much houses appreciated annually in the decades before the bubble, and then figure out how far out of line prices are now. Edward E. Leamer, director of the U.C.L.A. Anderson Forecast, has crunched these numbers for various regional markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ocean City, N.J., for example, inflation-adjusted house prices rose about 1.6 percent a year from 1988 through 2002. Compared with what this rate would predict, the city's houses in the first quarter of this year were overvalued by 51 percent. Over the previous year, they had fallen 0.6 percent; at this pace, Ocean City house prices will be at the right level in about 13 years. The model foretells eternal decline for some cities. It predicts that Kingston, N.Y., will not return to ''normal'' for almost four centuries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the reason these numbers may be hard to swallow, Mr. Leamer says, is that they do not capture the many differences between the economic conditions of the 1980s and today, or even 2002 and today. Income, mortgage rates and popular vacation spots have changed since then, as have myriad other factors deeply entwined with house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many experts look to price-to-rent ratios to estimate where house prices should be in a region. Because renting is a direct alternative to buying, and because rents tend to be less volatile than prices, rents are often considered to be a good shorthand for figuring out the intrinsic value of a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past decade, the price-to-rent ratio in many markets has exploded, indicating that people have been paying much more for their homes than the property is actually worth. From 1994 to 2002, for example, Phoenix had an average ratio of 11, according to data from Moody'sEconomy.com. After peaking in the last quarter of 2002 at 22.5, it cooled to about 17.3 in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This measure is popular but problematic because some economists say many of the homes that people rent (apartments in multifamily buildings) may not be comparable to the types of homes that people buy (single-family houses).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another ratio that housing economists watch is the ratio of home prices to per-capita income. This is telling because it shows whether Americans can actually afford the houses in their area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at previous peaks and troughs in the income ratio can provide an idea of where the housing market will bottom in a particular city. In Boston, for example, the housing market peaked in the late 1980s around 11, and then hovered around 7.5 when it bottomed in the late 1990s, according to Mr. Case. This time around, it peaked at over 12, and in the first quarter of this year, it was just over 10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Income and employment have had a particularly depressing effect on some regional housing markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Midwest, said Mr. Case, ''they never had a boom. There was no bubble. There's just a bust because employment's dropping like a rock.'' In Detroit, for example, the price to per-capita income ratio grew gradually from 1991 to about 2004, and has dropped steeply since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists argue that the price to per-capita income ratio is misleading, because the price used in that model does not take into account the full cost for buyers. This full cost should include not just the price of the house but mortgage rates as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As long as anyone can remember, as long as we have data, mortgage rates have been about 1.6 percent above the 10-year Treasury rate,'' said Christopher J. Mayer, an economist and senior vice dean at Columbia Business School. ''Today, it's more like 2.5 percent above the 10-year Treasury. That's a gigantic difference, literally reducing the amount of house someone could afford by 20 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has put together, in a model that has not yet been published, a rough calculation of where house prices should be if mortgage markets were functioning the way they had been in the last few decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This model shows that big-bubble cities like Miami and Phoenix were still overvalued in the range of 13 percent in May. It also found that San Francisco and Boston homes were corrected to the right level, and that homes were actually undervalued in New York by 5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Mayer says prices in these cities will probably continue to fall because of deteriorating mortgage markets and economic fundamentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet another ratio worth watching is the relationship of housing inventory to sales. This measures the imbalance between supply and demand, which is the economist's holy grail of market behavior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent International Monetary Fund paper argued this measure was the strongest determinant of housing prices in the short run. Booming areas were often overbuilt and have the most inventory to clear out before prices can recover. Inventory-to-sales ratio declines across California, for example, have given hope that the state is nearing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists put together many of these variables, along with others, to predict where housing prices will fall. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, for example, uses a complex data cocktail to calculate how overvalued each U.S. metropolitan area is. Its model takes into account per-capita income, wealth, vacation home demand, the attractiveness of investing in housing relative to other types of investments, and shifts in the availability of mortgage credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mayer's model, while unusual for its emphasis on mortgage rates, also uses rents, property tax rates, personal income tax rates, government interest rates, expected inflation and other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wrench in all these models is that this is the first national housing bust since anybody started keeping track of many of these useful data points. It is hard to predict how the national trends will affect state and city housing markets, which are otherwise very local organisms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trends from past national housing cycles are not especially helpful this time around. Mr. Case said that gross residential investment, the building of new homes, as a percent of gross domestic product peaked at about 5.6 percent and hit its trough at about 3.5 percent in three previous national housing cycles, from 1973 to 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These levels might therefore seem like good guidelines for the current cycle, which peaked at 5.5 percent in 2006. But the indicator has already dipped below that historic bottom, falling to 3.1 percent of G.D.P. in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For these reasons, some experts argued that it was silly to try to build a mathematical model for the market's overvaluation. Too much is unknown, they say, to make any predictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I try to avoid house price forecasting,'' said Paul S. Willen, senior economist and policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. ''Let me just say this, as an economist, that asset pricing is something we're exceptionally bad at.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHART: What's It Really Worth?: An analysis by Columbia Business School shows that home prices are still well above long-term averages in many cities.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sharp drop in June home sales started the stock market off on a sour note Thursday and new worries about banks sent shares into a slide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial shares plunged, snapping a six-session winning streak, as profit-taking dragged the Dow Jones industrial average down 283.10 points, or 2.43 percent, to 11,349.28, its worst loss in a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've had such a strong run especially in the financials,'' said Ryan Larson, a trader at Voyageur Asset Management. ''A lot of people are taking money off the table.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poor earnings at a regional bank, National City, and a gloomy report on the savings and loan, <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>, were two of the more obvious catalysts. And the disappointing home sales report for June renewed worries that the housing crisis could hound banks for months to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sell-off in financial shares brought down the broader market. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index declined 29.65 points, or 2.31 percent, to 1,252.54, and the Nasdaq composite index declined 45.77 points, or 1.97 percent, to 2,280.11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A glance at the day's worst performers highlighted the overlap between bank woes and mortgage troubles. Shares of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, the mortgage buyer, dipped 20 percent despite a rebound in recent days. Its sister company, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, was off 18 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of National City lost 2 percent after the Cleveland-based bank reported a $1.8 billion loss for the second quarter. It increased its reserves to $1.6 billion to protect against losses, more than 10 times the level from a year ago. ''We aren't going to be in a big hurry to declare that the corner has been turned and it all gets better from here,'' said the chief executive, Peter E. Raskind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>, which reported a $3.3 billion loss on Tuesday, fell 13.8 percent after losing more than 20 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analyst at Gimme Credit suggested that many of the bank's creditors were ''quietly pulling funds,'' a claim the bank called misguided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, however, forced <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span> to take the unusual step of issuing a statement about its financial strength for the second time in a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A California savings and loan, Downey Financial, watched its stock drop 34 percent after announcing its fourth consecutive loss and a shake-up in management. The bank said it was exploring ''strategic alternatives,'' which most likely means a sale, analysts said, given the challenge of raising capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big banks like <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, which had record gains in the last week, plunged. As a group, shares of financial firms listed in the S.&amp; P. 500 lost 6.3 percent Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil prices also moved higher. Crude oil futures settled $1.05 higher, at $125.49 a barrel in New York trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the market opened, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of previously owned homes, which make up most of the housing market, tumbled 2.6 percent in June after a 2 percent increase in May. The report reinforced fears that a weak job market and tight credit were discouraging home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June sales slowed to an annual rate of 4.86 million, adjusted for seasonal variables. Total sales were 15.5 percent below their level in June 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western states reported higher sales, with a 1 percent increase. But every other region saw declines, with sales falling 6.6 percent in the Northeast, 3.4 percent in the Midwest and 3.1 percent in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, the decline came from a 3.2 percent drop in sales of single-family homes; apartment and condominium sales increased 1.7 percent for the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was ''a little bit of a catalyst'' for the stock market, said Richard Sparks, an analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research. He said, however, that the declines in the Dow industrials were more likely attributable to profit-taking after the market's recent gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales rate, it would take more than 11 months to sell the current inventory of unsold homes, and some economists thought that estimate may be understated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Inventories are very high relative to sales rates, and would probably be even more so if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market instead of pulling it off in the face of weak demand and eroding prices,'' wrote Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at the research firm MFR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have risen modestly for the last four months, but they remain 6.1 percent below a year ago. The median price of a previously owned home in June was $215,100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Americans expect home prices to fall further in the next year, the Realtors group said, and many would-be buyers may be holding out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said that new unemployment claims rose 34,000 last week, to 406,000, the highest level since the month after Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the bond market, the price of the 10-year note rose 30/32, to 99. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, dipped to 4 percent, from 4.12 percent on Wednesday.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits and groundbreakings for new homes unexpectedly rose in June after a months-long downturn in residential construction, the government said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the gains came almost entirely from new apartment buildings in New York City, because of a quirk in the city's construction codes. Outside the Northeast, housing starts dipped 4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This report is much weaker than it looks,'' Ian Shepherdson, an economist at the research firm High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance, the report from the Commerce Department suggested a sudden change in fortunes for the ailing housing industry, which has suffered for months under a pall of plunging home values and a troubled mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 8:30 a.m., when the report was released, many economists said they felt thrown for a loop. Housing starts, which represent the beginning of work at new residential construction sites, were up 9.1 percent in June compared with the month before, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.066 million. The gain followed a 2.7 percent drop in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for new construction, which are issued before groundbreakings, were also up strongly, increasing 11.6 percent last month to an annual rate of 1.091 million. They fell 0.4 percent the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the figures reflected permits that builders in New York City had rushed to obtain so they could start construction projects before July 1, when the city enacted a new set of building codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, permits jumped 73 percent in the Northeast region and housing starts rose a whopping 103 percent in June. Nearly all of those increases involved multifamily dwellings like apartments and condominium complexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The city may never sleep, but many analysts, including us, were caught asleep at the switch,'' Richard Moody, an economist at the real estate firm Mission Residential, wrote in a research note. In reality, he said, ''the data do not significantly alter the view of the housing market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction on new single-family homes, a category that excluded the apartment buildings affected by the New York surge, dropped 5.3 percent for the month. Permits for single-family homes dipped 3.5 percent. After adjusting for New York City, permits were up 0.7 percent over all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreakings declined in Midwestern and Western states and gained slightly in Southern states. Permits were up 3 percent in the South, up 0.9 percent in the West, and down slightly in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downturn in the housing market has put enormous pressure on home builders. Permit and housing start levels are far below their level of a year ago in every region in the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, housing starts were 27 percent below their level in June 2007. Building permits were 24 percent behind their pace in June 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook, too, remains bleak. ''The magnitude of the housing bubble was unprecedented, and the corrective process promises to be a long and painful one,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief domestic economist at research firm MFR, wrote in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the number of new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 18,000 last week, to 366,000, the Labor Department said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in December, real estate interests -- which have helped bankroll so many city campaigns -- will be severely restricted from giving contributions to political candidates. That is a big problem for Melinda R. Katz, a candidate for city comptroller. As chairwoman of the City Council's Land Use Committee, Ms. Katz has taken in hundreds of thousands of dollars from the real estate industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Katz has come up with an unusual request that would allow her to keep the money from the real estate industry flowing. She has asked the city's Campaign Finance Board to permit her to set up now an account that she could tap if she faced a runoff in the election for comptroller next fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would allow her to keep collecting big donations from the real estate industry for much of this year, while they are still legal, and then to spend the money in the heat of battle next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly it's a move to circumvent the campaign finance limits,'' said one of her opponents, Councilman David I. Weprin of Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, it is not unusual for a candidate, especially someone likely to be a top contender, to set up an account ahead of time for a runoff campaign. But typically, such an account is authorized a month or two before the runoff begins, not 14 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's shocking that someone this far out from the election would put forth such a transparent effort to get around the intent, if not the letter, of the regulations or limitations,'' said Doug Forand, spokesman for David Yassky, another candidate for comptroller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new limits on donations from the real estate industry and others with interests before the city were approved by the City Council last year in an effort to reduce the disproportionate influence the interests yield over city elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lobbyists and contractors are among those affected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the most recent reporting deadline in January, no candidate for citywide office had attracted more real estate money than Ms. Katz, whose approval is required for all major projects and zoning changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if the city's Campaign Finance Board approves her request, real estate professionals who have already given her campaign the maximum allowed by law, $4,950, would be able to contribute a fresh $2,475 to a new runoff account, rather than the $200 that will be allowed after the new rules take effect in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Ms. Katz said that her request was not related to the looming restrictions and that she simply wanted to raise money as early as possible so she could focus on wooing voters next fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the request actually demonstrated just how qualified she was to be the city's chief accountant, because of her ability to anticipate situations and take calculated risks well ahead of everyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that the September 2009 Democratic primary for comptroller has attracted several well-financed candidates, Ms. Katz argues that it is reasonable to expect that no one will eclipse the 40 percent threshold necessary to prevent a runoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board could rule on Ms. Katz's request as early as Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that's exactly the characteristic you'd want in a New York City comptroller: thinking ahead, trying to be efficient,'' she said. ''In order to do a proper runoff, I'd like to be finished raising money, and I'd like to prepare for the debate. This will give me that opportunity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And far being apologetic for being supported by real estate professionals, Ms. Katz, who had raised $1.9 million over all as of January, said that she was proud of all the support she had received so far from a cross-section of unions, businesses and elected officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The folks that have donated to my campaign, I would hope, care deeply about the future of the economy of this city, so if developers, financial folks, business owners and others are donating, I'm proud of the fact that they believe that I would be a good steward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Friedman, a spokesman for the Campaign Finance Board, said he was not at liberty to discuss Ms. Katz's request because it was a pending matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But several campaign finance lawyers said they would be surprised if the board ruled for Ms. Katz, because of the precedent it would set and because of the impact such a ruling might have on the races for mayor and public advocate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The earliest the board has authorized establishing runoff accounts was Feb. 6, 2001, when Mark Green and Fernando Ferrer were dueling in the Democratic primary for mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such approvals, however, are typically not given until a month or two before the September primary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But already, 2009 is promising to be an election year like no other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the politicians occupying the offices of mayor, comptroller, public advocate, four out of five borough presidencies and two-thirds of the City Council all scheduled to leave office because of term limits, more people than ever have declared their candidacies.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the Editor:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Fuel Prices Shift Math for Life in Far Suburbs'' (news article, June 25) aptly describes the effects of rising gasoline prices on household expenses, particularly for those living in suburban and exurban areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it isn't merely gas prices affecting housing affordability. It's the total cost of car ownership: vehicle purchase(s), insurance and maintenance, along with fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research assessing the role of transportation costs in housing affordability shows that average transportation costs vary greatly depending on location, from 14 percent of household median income in transit-rich, compact communities to 28 percent or more where employment, retail and other amenities are dispersed and more cars are needed per household.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add that to the 30 percent of income that is the maximum a household should spend on housing, and little discretionary income remains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Choosing a place to live based on access to transportation options can help families significantly lower their cost of living.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Wednesday about second-quarter reports on the Manhattan real estate market misstated the period of time over which average co-op prices fell by 8 percent, according to Prudential Douglas Elliman. It was since the previous quarter, not the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Thu Jul 03 2008 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite slowing sales and continuing economic worries, market studies released yesterday showed that the Manhattan co-op and condominium market remained strong in the peak spring selling season, with prices up 25 percent or more compared with a year ago, and overall prices roughly flat or just below record levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average prices reached about $1.67 million for a Manhattan apartment in the second quarter, 1 percent to 3 percent below the record levels reported in the previous quarter, according to the series of competing market studies prepared by the major brokerage firms in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these figures include a number of closings over the winter at two immensely expensive new condominium projects -- the Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenue and 15 Central Park West -- that drove up average prices in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When these high-end sales were excluded for the second quarter, Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist of both Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens, said his figures still showed that average sales prices were actually up about 5 percent over the first quarter. ''Prices are at incredibly high levels,'' Mr. Heym said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Mr. Heym and other analysts said there was increasing concern that prices would remain flat or perhaps decline over the next year, especially if the economy continued to weaken. So far, he said, despite reports of recent and impending layoffs, the local economy has ''yet to show any real weakness.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While luxury sales remained very strong, the reports showed slowing sales and weakening prices for studios and one-bedroom apartments, where buyers are extremely sensitive to tighter lending requirements and larger down payments now being demanded by mortgage lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of sales dropped sharply, by about 22 percent, compared with the second quarter of 2007, which was a record year for sales, according to an analysis released by Prudential Douglas Elliman. But at the same time, the number of sales was higher compared with the same period in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of unsold apartments rose to 9,968 in the second quarter, 21 percent higher than the year before, according to a tally by <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group.</span> But the total number of apartments listed for sale in June had fallen by 1.2 percent since April, and was reported to be below inventory levels of several years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong luxury sales and faltering studio sales had the perverse effect of catapulting the median price -- the price of the apartment exactly in the middle of all sale prices -- to a record. It was close to or slightly above $1 million, depending on the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report by Prudential Douglas Elliman found that average co-op prices fell by 8 percent compared with a year before, to $1.28 million, while the average condo price fell by 2.3 percent, to $1.94 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, the president and chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said there was ''a lot of pressure on one-bedrooms and studios'' but that ''anyone who thinks price appreciation is over in this market is dreaming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flat sales picture has led many brokers to look back on 2007 as the golden age of Manhattan real estate, when inventory was falling and prices were rising regularly to new records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Liebman said that while ''everything was perfect in 2007,'' the party was far from over. ''It is still a party,'' she said. ''We are just not serving Cristal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Inc, an appraisal firm, who prepares the market report for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that the decline in average prices was the first since the fall of 2006, and could augur a turning point in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are looking at several years of lackluster performance at best,'' Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dorothy Herman, president and chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that ''obviously the frenzy mentality is gone,'' and she predicted that the market would be flat or down slightly during the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said buyers were cautious and price sensitive, and lenders were requiring a lot more cash down. Still, she said, ''New York was different from the rest of the country,'' and she said that bidding wars over well-priced apartments would continue. ''I don't think New York is going to collapse,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time, the report by <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> distinguished sales of new condo and co-op apartments from sales of existing apartments, which is similar to the way real estate sales data is collected across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report found that the average sales price of existing apartments rose 10 percent compared with a year ago, to $1.43 million, and fell 8 percent from the first quarter. But average sale prices at new developments rose to $2.2 million, a 61 percent increase from a year ago, and a 17 percent increase from the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn, the report found that co-op and condo prices rose 5 percent in the first half of 2008 compared with a year earlier, to an average of $621,000. In Williamsburg, where the prices were highest, the average price fell by 26 percent. The average price of a single-family town house fell by 17 percent in Brooklyn, to $1.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said that the market reports reflected closed sales, based on contracts that were signed in the last 3 to 12 months. But based on contracts signed recently, he said that sales were off 16 percent this year, but the total value of sales was roughly equal to the total value of sales a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If properties are priced within their value range, they sell and they sell well,'' he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Exports Lift Manufacturing; Construction Spending Falls</span>
</div><div class="author">By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   </div><div>454 words</div><div>2 July 2008</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>The New York Times on the Web</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of manufacturing activity in the United States has grown for the first time in five months in June, but mostly because of strong exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading of 50.2 from the Institute for Supply Managementsurvey was up from 49.6 in May. It beat economists' prediction of a reading of 48.7, according to the consensus estimate of Wall Street economists surveyed by Thomson Financial/IFR. A reading above 50 signals growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the previous four months, the index had hovered near its lowest level in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending fell in May for the 11th time in the last year as a continuing slump in housing offset strength in nonresidential building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending dropped 0.4 percent in May, slightly less than had been expected. There was strength in spending on hotels and office buildings but continued declines in housing, which has been in a slump for two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction dropped 1.6 percent in May, the 25th decline out of the last 26 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders have been frantically slashing back on their production in the face of the worst slump in housing in more than two decades. Analysts believe housing activity will keep falling for some time because even with the cutbacks in production, the backlog of unsold homes is remaining near record levels. The problem is that a rising tide of foreclosures is forcing even more properties onto the already glutted market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private nonresidential construction rose 0.2 percent in May to an all-time high of $405.3 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. The small increase followed even bigger 1.6 percent gains in both April and March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength in May reflected a big increase in spending on hotels and motels and a smaller advance in office construction. These gains helped to offset declines in spending on shopping centers and amusement and recreation centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists believe that strength seen recently in nonresidential construction will not last. They are concerned that a severe credit crunch occurring as banks tightening standards in the wake of rising mortgage defaults will begin to squeeze nonresidential building projects as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on government projects rose by 0.4 percent to a record of $301.1 billion at an annual rate in May. A gain of 0.6 percent in state and local building projects offset a 1.7 percent drop in federal construction spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 0.4 percent drop in overall construction spending represented the 11th decline in the last year and left total construction spending at $1.085 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT the Fitzgerald, a new condominium development carved out of a prewar warehouse on West 117th Street in Harlem, sales have been steady but slow, with some would-be buyers worried about getting the jumbo mortgages they need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the developers, Robert Friedman and his brother, Bernard, have decided they will issue mortgages directly to buyers at competitive interest rates, on as much as 90 percent of the purchase price, with no points and no appraisal fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We see buyers who otherwise in a different market would have qualified for mortgages,'' Robert Friedman said. ''It works for buyers, we break even on costs, and it facilitates a sale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Friedman has seen the ups and downs of the real estate market through several stormy cycles, and offered similar financing plans in the 1970s and '80s. Now, as the velocity of sales has slowed, he is trying again, though he is holding the line on asking prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the loan offer was included in a condominium plan amendment in April, Mr. Friedman said, three buyers have signed contracts with the financing and a fourth is about to. Two of the buyers took out the maximum conventional government-insured mortgages for the first $417,000 and then used sponsor financing for the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fitzgerald, just off Frederick Douglass Boulevard near the epicenter of Harlem's condominium development scene, has 47 one- and two-bedroom apartments, available from $655,000 to $1.85 million (for a two-bedroom 2,284-square-foot penthouse with four skylights and a terrace). The apartments are being marketed by Halstead's new development group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, 19 units are said to have gone into contract since the building was approved for sale about a year ago. The hulking warehouse was last used as a charter school. Under the renovation, much of its facade has been covered with terra-cotta-colored panels, and a sculpture that looks like a wall of water was installed in the lobby. The condominium is due to open in the next week or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loans offered by the sponsor have the same repayment schedule as 30-year-loans, but are available for a maximum of seven years -- more than enough time, Mr. Friedman said, to wait out the national real estate malaise. Interest rates will be set a half a percentage point below those offered by Citicorp on comparable 30-year loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said buyers would be required to put down at least 10 percent, or $65,000 for the least expensive unit, and to qualify for the loans. But he also said the sponsor's standards would be ''much more liberal'' than the ones currently set by most banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Gerringer, who overseas new developments at Prudential Douglas Elliman and is not involved in the Fitzgerald, says that ''when things are tough,'' sponsor financing is ''not a crazy idea,'' if pricing is in line with the market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE euphoria is past. The era of rampant house flipping is gone. What was once a seemingly unstoppable climb in home prices has given way to a plunge in value in many areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, there is a bit of good news: This might be the right time to find a bargain, especially for buyers approaching their retirement years who can afford to take their time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only are home prices down more than 25 percent in some parts of the country, there remains a glut of inventory on the market in traditional retirement destinations like Florida, Arizona and Nevada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, anyone looking to buy can also find good reasons to take a wait-and-see attitude, like the fact that good deals may not exist in every location, and no one really knows if prices will continue to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like missing the top of the market -- it's the same thing with the bottom,'' said Maurice Veissi, president of Veissi and Associates in Miami. ''Generally you know it's happened because you're looking in the rearview mirror and it's passed you by.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the latest <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, the average price for a single-family home is down nearly 27 percent in Miami compared with a year ago, versus a 25 percent decline in Phoenix and a 27 percent drop in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three markets were at the forefront of the recent run-up in home prices and are now leading the decline -- a pattern reflected to varying degrees in other markets in all three states. But that means there are deals to be found in places where buyers previously felt priced out of the Sunbelt lifestyle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One beneficiary of the bust is Franke Watson II, a 69-year-old retiree from New Orleans who purchased a home in Prescott, Ariz., in February for more than $100,000 below its initial list price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The house had originally been listed for $430,000,'' he said in a phone interview after a morning hike. ''When I looked at it, it was $349,000. I offered them $300,000 and we finally settled at $309,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Watson first discovered Prescott, a city of around 40,000 people 100 miles north of Phoenix, on a road trip to California. After scouting out options near San Diego and Long Beach, he returned to Prescott, preferring its climate, proximity to hiking and small-town feel. (The city's motto is ''Everybody's Hometown.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when he relocated to Prescott last July he decided to rent at first rather than buy. ''I didn't think the real estate market was where I wanted it to be,'' he explained. He finally purchased a three-bedroom brick ranch once prices came down to what he expected to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the same approach Mercedes Gutierrez and her husband, Alex, are taking in looking for a second home where they will eventually retire. They currently live with their 9-year-old daughter in Cooper City, Fla., but would like to buy a home in the Keys to use as a weekend getaway until Mr. Gutierrez, a police officer, retires in a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far, prices haven't fallen into the $500,000 to $520,000 range they hope to pay for a three-bedroom home on the ocean side of the Keys -- ideally on a canal, since Mr. Gutierrez plans to spend some of his free time fishing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've found a few things, but at the same time we're not in a hurry because we have time on our side,'' Ms. Gutierrez said. ''We're playing the waiting game to see how much people will drop their prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although she said brokers haven't balked at the couple's expectations, most of the properties that fit their criteria are currently listed in the $650,000 to $700,000 range, which means they may have to compromise if prices don't decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At some point, we're going to have to sit down and say what's more important and what can we live without,'' Ms. Gutierrez said. ''Because if the prices are still high, we're going to have to give in on something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wayne Archer, executive director of the Bergstrom Center for Real Estate Studies at the University of Florida, said many buyers were still waiting on the sidelines to see where prices settle, but he emphasized that the state's housing market was more complex than general statistics -- and some news reports -- might suggest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Florida is not over, as far as we can tell,'' Mr. Archer said. While acknowledging challenges like the oversupply of condos in Miami and the decline in people moving to the state, he pointed to the wide variation in the housing markets in different areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to data from the Florida Association of Realtors, although the median sales price for an existing single-family home declined 28 percent in the Fort Pierce-Port St. Lucie area in the first quarter compared with last year, prices declined only 1 percent on Marco Island during the same time period. Statewide, prices dropped an average of 15 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from the ups and downs of the real estate market, what may end up becoming more of a factor in Florida and other retirement destinations is broader demographic trends, particularly as baby boomers approach retirement age -- or delay those plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An April survey by AARP looking at how people 45 and older are managing the economic slump found that 19 percent of respondents aged 55 to 64 were postponing their retirement, which underlines a long-term trend of people planning to stay in the workforce longer, at least part-time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they do finally retire, 9 out of 10 people stay either in the same home or the same county -- a pattern that is expected to continue, if not increase, with the baby boomer generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are looking to stay where they are -- they're closer to family, they're closer to friends, they're closer to the life that they built,'' said Jim Dau, an AARP spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But turmoil in the housing market has certainly played a role in some people's decision to stay put. William H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution who studies migration patterns, said the most recent census data showed a slowdown in the number of people flocking to Florida, Arizona and Nevada, all previously hot destinations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, Florida gained 35,000 residents in the last year measured, through July 2007, versus an average of 230,000 per year for the previous three years. Mr. Frey attributed that change partly to the tightening credit market and the difficulty of selling a current home in order to relocate somewhere else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He expects that baby boomers will further affect migration patterns as they head into their retirement years and settle in a wider range of places than previous generations of retirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will be a much more varied group of destinations -- they're going to sprinkle out all over the place,'' Mr. Frey said. ''Some will go to the city, others will go to high-amenity places in the West and Southeast, others will be going to the classic retirement communities in Florida and Arizona. So it's hard to pigeonhole this generation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although not a boomer at age 73, Hank Wintczak fits the profile of a retiree who has no intention of moving far from home. He and his companion, Kelly Guyett, live in Elgin, Ill., west of Chicago and recently purchased a two-bedroom home for $330,000 in the nearby Sun City Huntley development. It is one of 60 Del Webb active adult communities open for new home sales in 20 states, an expansion that reflects the diversity of destinations appealing to buyers, who must be 55 or older.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wintczak said he and Ms. Guyett both have children, grandchildren and lots of friends in the area, so never considered relocating far away, but were attracted by Sun City Huntley's activities and amenities, which include a fitness center, swimming pool,softball field, tennis courts, a restaurant and many classes and clubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've just heard from a lot of people that they love it there,'' he said, mentioning the daily poker games friends reported as a particular draw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That hobby may explain why Mr. Wintczak was willing to take a gamble and go ahead with the purchase, even though he still has to sell his own home, which is listed for $269,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know I'm taking a chance, but eventually it's going to sell,'' he said. ''It's time to get on with our lives in a different situation where we can have a lot more fun.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who are thinking about relocating, Las Vegas may be a good place to take a gamble. Patty Kelley, president of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors, said more than 50 percent of closed sales in May were foreclosures, and prices in some areas are down more than 30 percent compared with a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the median price of a single-family home increased 0.3 percent between April and May, an early if tentative sign that prices may be stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acknowledging the impossibility of determining a market bottom ''until we look back six months after the statistics have come out,'' Ms. Kelley said she is blunt about that point with prospective buyers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ailing housing market got a bit of a bump last month, as steadily falling home prices led to a small increase in sales, a realty group said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which make up most of the nation's housing market, increased 2 percent in May, reversing two months of declines. Sales ran at an annualized pace of 4.99 million, up from 4.89 million in April, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors, an industry group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though sales were up for the month, economists said that May was an anomaly amid a broader downward trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We do not expect residential real estate markets to turn around soon,'' Stuart G. Hoffman, the chief economist of <span class="companylink">PNC Bank</span>, wrote in a note to clients. ''Buyers still face significant disincentives as home prices continue to drop in most markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seasonal factors were cited by economists as an impetus for the rise in sales. Some warned that conditions had deteriorated since the data for the report was recorded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unemployment and mortgage rates have risen further, and consumers have moved closer to a breakdown,'' Dimitry Fleming, an economist at ING Bank in London, wrote in a note. ''We doubt a further recovery is at hand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes were up 1.6 percent, and sales of apartments and condominiums increased by 5.5 percent. Sales rose 5.5 percent in the Midwest, 4.6 percent in the Northeast and 2 percent in the West. In the South, sales dropped 0.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Values rose as well, with the median price rising to $208,600, from $201,200 in April. Prices moved higher for both single-family and multifamily dwellings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high level of inventories still poses a problem for sellers; at this pace, it would take about 11 months to work off the current housing inventory, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The large supply of homes on the market clearly favors buyers, and it should take several months to draw the inventory down,'' Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the increase in home sales came in slightly ahead of economists' expectations, a comparison with May 2007 reveals the extent of the damage done to the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were down nearly 16 percent from a year ago, and condominium sales were off by 25 percent. Median prices were 6.3 percent lower than in May 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said that while foreclosures continue to hurt the market, sales in some distressed markets had improved. He cited Sacramento, the San Fernando Valley and Monterey County in California; Sarasota, Fla.; and Battle Creek, Mich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report on Thursday, the government slightly raised its estimate for the nation's economic activity in the first quarter. The growth in the gross domestic product was revised up to 1 percent, from a preliminary estimate of 0.9 percent, the Commerce Department said. The government originally estimated that the economy grew by a sluggish 0.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said in a report Thursday that the number of new applications filed for unemployment benefits was unchanged last week, holding steady at 384,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the better-than-expected data, stock markets traded sharply lower Thursday after several prominent companies received downgrades from Wall Street analysts. Shares of <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> dropped 6 percent, and <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> fell 11 percent after <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> said the companies would face new problems in coming months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE evidence of the Manhattan real estate miracle -- or is it a mirage? -- continues to pour in. While most of the country is in the doldrums, prices during the second quarter have so far remained at or close to a peak, despite a decline in sales of lower-priced apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even among apartments priced under $1 million, where hedge fund managers don't deign to tread, it is far from a runaway buyers' market, real estate brokers say. A well-priced apartment can still produce a sizzling bidding war among those yearning for that rarest of commodities -- an affordable family-sized apartment in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what happened after David G. Rubin, a professor of literature specializing in Indian and Nepali literature at Sarah Lawrence College and Columbia University, died earlier this year at age 83 and his co-op apartment went on the market at 54 Morningside Drive, at West 116th Street, in the heart of Morningside Heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broker hired by the estate, Peter Griffiths of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, listed the apartment in May for $799,000. It has six rooms in 1,300 square feet of space. He wanted to price it aggressively he said, but he soon discovered that he had flat out made a mistake. Because of an error in a corporate data system, Mr. Griffiths said he never noticed that a similar apartment listed on the same floor had sold a few years ago for just over $900,000. But no matter. As soon as the listing went up, he was besieged by would-be buyers who began making offers above the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In five days, 39 buyers came through the apartment. For two and a half days, he said, he scheduled a showing every half hour, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. A neighbor told him about the $900,000 sale and he soon learned, he said, that the building was one of only a few on Morningside Drive not owned by Columbia University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffiths's listing noted the apartment ''may need a little T.L.C.,'' but it also has three bedrooms, if you include the 9-foot-by-10-foot former maid's room. It has a large 22-foot-wide combined dining room and living room with large windows facing east looking over Morningside Park and Harlem and beyond. ''The apartment had great bones,'' he said, perfect for ''families looking to find a place big enough to stay in Manhattan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the apartment was shown for five weekdays, Mr. Griffiths held an open house two days later, and 25 groups of buyers showed up. He and the estate decided to go to a ''highest, best offer by the following Tuesday.'' There were 10 offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment, now in contract, went for nearly $1 million.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN Manhattan, foreign investors, trading on the dollar's weakness, have helped keep apartment prices at stratospheric levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But across the country, in markets that have typically attracted second-home buyers, overseas money has been far more ethereal. And it still remains both a great hope and a much less sure bet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents for properties adjacent to America's most desired beach and ski communities say there have been a lot more foreigners looking to take advantage of favorable exchange rates in the last year. But they say these prospective buyers are still wary of America's volatile economy and concerned that housing prices could continue to decline. The result is that despite their interest to get a great deal, foreigners have been slow to purchase in all but the most recession-proof properties in the most expensive areas, like East Hampton and Beverly Hills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rick Hoffman, regional senior vice president with Corcoran, which runs one of the largest real estate offices on the East End of Long Island, said sales at the very high end have remained very strong, though they have slowed in the midtier, which he defined as $1 million to $3 million. ''We are seeing more foreigners looking at properties,'' he said, ''but nothing like New York City has had.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we are definitely seeing is an increase in foreign renters,'' he said, noting the firming of the euro and pound over the last two years and a leveling of rental prices. ''So for them,'' he added, ''it is an automatic discount.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other markets, like Cape Cod, which is not inexpensive but still pales compared with the Hamptons, foreigners are cautious, but are looking and are providing hope for the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In truth, this year was a little slower out of the blocks than last spring,'' said Brendan Cunningham , the chief executive of ERA Cape Real Estate in Harwichport, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said that open houses have been full of foreigners interested in renting, perhaps with an eye to buying. The Cape, he said, was getting a large number of Britons, in part because of a marketing campaign in England.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deb Howard, who runs a real estate firm in the Lake Tahoe area, said her region was also among those drawing a lot more foreigners, primarily from Mexico and Asia because of more favorable currency rates. There, too, she said, a lot of visitors are looking but have not yet committed to buy. ''I am seeing an increase in inquiries; the early signs of the interest,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite that hesitation, Ms. Howard said she saw a positive trend. ''I believe it will eventually be good for sales,'' she said. She added that in just the last two years the Heavenly Valley Ski Resort, which straddles the Nevada-California border, has had a 22 percent increase in condo owners who registered their first address as being overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Eventually,'' of course, can be a painful period of time to wait. Some second-home markets have fared poorly in recent years. Sales of vacation properties fell nearly 31 percent in 2007 from the previous year, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the sales of homes that were bought as primary residences declined by only 10 percent in the same period, the association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEITHER the association nor the Census Bureau keeps track of how many of those second homes went to people who make their primary residence outside of the United States, but there can be no doubt that the exchange rates for the last few years have made such purchases tempting. Although it has lately recouped some strength, in the last two years alone, the dollar is off nearly 6 percent against the pound, over 18 percent against the euro and about 9 percent against both the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists who track the housing market say foreign buyers must be helping, or are at least lessening the pain, in the real estate market. ''The circumstantial evidence strongly argues that global investors are indeed supporting these second-home markets,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People have cash overseas, and U.S. vacation spots look like a bargain, so we are not seeing the decline in prices one might expect,'' he said. ''In places like Miami, for example, prices are falling but not collapsing the way you would have thought. It shows decline, not free fall.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the Realtors' association doesn't keep track of what percentage of second-home buyers are foreigners, it can say for sure that the buyers who are most likely to put down money describe themselves as long-term owners -- that is, not so worried about immediately recouping money for a mortgage through rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That focus on long-term value has hurt places like Orlando, which sells a lot more moderately priced properties and condos, said Darlene J. Brannigan, an agent with Florida Spirit Real Estate Services, who primarily sells properties under $400,000 near <span class="companylink">Disney</span> World.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Foreigners were our best buyers,'' she lamented, particularly the British and the Irish until 2007. ''Now they are afraid of our shaky economy. If they buy a house, what if it crashes and goes lower and lower. And I am supposed to rent them out when they are not occupied, and that's getting harder and harder.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But areas that have historically held their value are a lure to investors who don't need to worry about long-term carrying costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, soon after John Cook sold a vacation property in Italy, he visited friends in New York City. As part of the trip, Mr. Cook, who runs a furniture importing business from London, went to the friends' summer home in East Hampton. He fell in love with the beaches and with what his money could buy on this side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I guess I was bowled over at what a pound was worth compared to the dollar,'' he said. He decided to start looking. In the fall, he returned and visited 30 properties and bid on three. By January he had closed a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS it turns out, Mr. Cook will rent out his property for $30,000 for July and August but only, he said, because his agent, Michael Schultz, also of Corcoran's Eastern Long Island office, found an interested party and delivered the deal to his door. Otherwise, he might just have kept it for himself. He plans to make his money in the resale eventually, and he is confident that the Hamptons will hold value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The place he chose was in the woods instead of close to the ocean. With a double-height ceiling in the living room and a 40-foot in-ground pool in the back, it was far from a dump -- but with three bedrooms, nor was it a mansion. Although it was listed at $1.25 million, Mr. Cook said he had managed to pay a little less. Still, he added, with the British pound at about $2, ''it felt like a steal.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales unexpectedly rose in April to the highest reading since October, an industry group said Monday, but experts said the large proportion of distressed property sales would continue to weigh down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' seasonally adjusted index of pending sales for existing homes rose to 88.2, from a March reading of 83.0, the lowest since the index was started in 2001. It was still 13 percent below April 2007's reading of 101.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street economists polled by Thomson/IFR had predicted the index would remain steady at 83.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reading of 100 is equal to the average level of sales activity in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Global Insight economist, Patrick Newport, tempered his enthusiasm for the surprising increase in April's pending sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's good news, but I'm not jumping for joy because I'm not convinced that it's telling us things are picking up,'' he said ''It's telling me that banks are dumping properties at fire sale prices, spurring home sales.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Newport said that inventory remained at record highs and was growing, especially in the West where foreclosures and so-called short sales made up the bulk of deals. In a short sale, the house is sold for less than the amount owed on the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales there climbed 8.3 percent from March and were 4 percent higher than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank-owned properties and short sales in San Diego are also pulling first-time home buyers from the sidelines, said Gregg Neuman, a Prudential real estate agent. Once shut out of the market, buyers now stand to receive a 20 percent discount on these distressed homes, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Bargain hunters have entered the market en masse,'' said the agent association's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, remarking on the increase in pending sales, especially in the most troubled markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Midwest, the index jumped 13 percent, while the South index posted a 4.6 percent gain. Only the Northeast index registered a decline, of 1.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association expects existing home sales to total 5.40 million this year and increase to 5.74 million in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price is expected to drop 8.4 percent in the first half of the year before stabilizing. Next year, prices will rise 4.4 percent, to $213,900, it estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody'sEconomy.com, said he believed that April marked the bottom for home sales, but that prices would not bottom out for a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the beginning of the end of the housing downturn, but it will be a long painful ending,'' he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE death knell for the Manhattan real estate bubble has been sounded regularly for at least four years. Yet despite the warnings, and a bleak housing picture across the country, average Manhattan co-op and condominium sale prices continued their upward trajectory last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A preliminary tabulation of sales completed in May shows that median and average apartment prices edged up slightly, to a record level, nearly $1.54 million (excluding recent closings at two of the most expensive new developments ever, at 15 Central Park West and at the Plaza Hotel).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of sales in May, filed with the Department of Finance by the middle of last week, was higher than in any month since August 2007, and the number of sales above $4 million -- 52 so far -- was the highest ever. Brokers said there was considerable demand for unusual and expensive trophy properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there were some signs of caution in the preliminary numbers, the first indicator of the contracts signed in the spring selling season, which usually continues through the Fourth of July. The number of sales closed during May was 20 percent below May 2007, when the number of sales set a record for any single month. They were, however, above the sales volume recorded in May 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a number of celebrated recent developments, from the <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center facing Central Park, to 40 Bond Street off the Bowery in NoHo, condo owners have trimmed their asking prices on resales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 40 Bond, the resale asking price on a three-bedroom triplex was cut by $1 million in late May, to $10.9 million, or about $2,900 a square foot. Dennis Mangone, a broker at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> who recently had three listings in the building (one was just rented), said that competition between the sponsor (there is still one unsold one-bedroom ) and individual owners had ''cannibalized resales'' and that he expected prices to appreciate considerably in the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>, there are now 16 apartments on the market, according to Streeteasy.com, including three for which the asking prices were cut in the last few weeks, two of them by more than $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there were signs of a slowdown in sales of smaller, lower-priced apartments, though there too the picture was mixed. May sales of apartments under $1 million were roughly flat compared with recent months, but off by nearly a third compared with the year before, according to the sales tabulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers said that some buyers were holding back because of market uncertainty and tighter credit standards set by mortgage lenders. But some properties were still setting off bidding wars among buyers who had already been qualified for loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory Hall, a Corcoran broker, listed a 1,000-square-foot co-op on 71st Street between Columbus Avenue and Central Park West for $1.095 million in mid-April and quickly had six people bidding, two for the full asking price and four above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment was once a one-bedroom, but the architect who owned it converted the dining room into a second bedroom and transformed a closet into a half-bath. It is now in contract for well over the asking price, Mr. Hall said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some buyers are definitely sitting on the fence,'' he said. ''What this proves is that if something is nice and priced right, it is still going to move fast.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal company Miller Samuel, said that unsold inventory was running about 27 percent above that of last May, a time when inventory was unusually low. He said the market was ''moving sideways, flat'' with some apartments selling for less than they would have a few months ago, and some selling for more, a trend that he believes is likely to continue.</p>
