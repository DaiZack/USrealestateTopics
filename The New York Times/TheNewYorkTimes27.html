<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just because the median sales price of a single-family home jumped 16 percent to an all-time high of $660,000 during the second quarter of this year, sellers should not jump to conclusions about how much money their properties might fetch.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The major driver of the second-quarter price picture was a sharp increase in the number of sales of high-end homes, the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service reported. And while it may seem counterintuitive, year to year price appreciation was highest -- about 8 percent -- for properties selling for less than $750,000. High-end properties increased in price only about 4 percent; it's just that so many more of them sold. There were 319 sales in Westchester of $1 million and higher properties in the second quarter of 2004, 66 percent more than the 192 that sold in that price category in 2003. ELSA BRENNER  </p>

</div><div class="author">By ELSA BRENNER  </div><div>599 words</div><div>1 August 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>2</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price of a single-family house in Westchester County soared to an all-time high of $660,000 in the second quarter -- the first time it ever exceeded $600,000 -- according to the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. The price represents an increase of nearly 16 percent over the county's median for the second quarter last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of sales also sharply increased over all, and the rise was most pronounced among the most expensive properties, the report said. The listing service reported 319 sales of Westchester properties in excess of $1 million in the three months that ended on June 30, compared with 192 in the corresponding quarter of 2003, a 66 percent increase. In the next tier down, from $750,000 to $999,999, there were 274 sales in the second quarter compared with 191 a year earlier, a 43 percent increase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency said the increases appear to have been fueled in part by anxiety over rising mortgage interest rates. In January, the average rate on a 30-year conventional mortgage was about 6 percent and it declined to about 5.5 percent by early March, but it rose to 6.5 percent in May. Buyers apparently feared that their window of opportunity might be closing and accelerated their purchasing decisions, the listing service said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other factors were seen as contributing to the county's healthy residential market. There were reports of new corporate relocations to the county, and the unemployment rate has remained steady, hovering around 4 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, perhaps as a result of the impulse to act before interest rates rise, many more new listings came on the market this year than last: 5,065 in the second quarter of 2004 compared with 4,483 in the corresponding period of 2003. Thus, even with the intense sales activity, the second quarter closed with an inventory of 5,250 homes in Westchester, a 2.5 percent increase over last year's level at the quarter's end. In the past several years, there has been a shortage of listings, which has undoubtedly contributed to the increase in prices but has also held down the number of sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that changed in the most recent three months, with total Westchester sales setting a record for any second quarter: 2,531 closed sales, 24 percent higher than a year earlier. The figures reflect sales activity in the first quarter of the year, which is typically the peak selling season. The previous record of 2,509 sales was set in the second quarter of 1998.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester's condominium and co-op markets were also robust. The median sale price of a condo was $340,000, up 13.3 percent from a year earlier. And the median price of a co-op rose to $147,000, up 12.2 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, the combination of higher sales volume and higher prices resulted in a record-high dollar volume for a second quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar value of all sales in Westchester was almost $1.56 billion, a 44 percent increase from last year. That number encompassed sales of two- to five-family homes in addition to single-family homes, condominiums and co-ops. ELSA BRENNER  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, July 26 -- Sales and prices of existing homes in the United States rose to record highs in June, the National Association of Realtors said on Monday, as home buyers moved to take advantage of low mortgage rates that were expected to rise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased 2.1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 6.95 million units in June, from an upward-revised pace of 6.81 million units in May. Analysts had expected a decline to 6.67 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price nationwide rose to $191,800.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There could be some rush of last-minute buyers realizing this could be their last opportunity to get into the home buying market,'' said Lawrence Yun, senior economist with the Realtors' group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing inventories dipped to a 4.1-month supply at the current sales pace. The limited number of homes for sale has been driving prices higher in recent months. June's median sales price was up from $182,400 in May and was 9.6 percent higher than in June 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Home price increases are being driven by the fundamentals of strong demand and lean supply,'' Mr. Yun said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the increase in selling prices, which has been pronounced in some areas of the country, some economists insist there is little reason to fear that a national housing price bubble is forming because the economy is growing and adding jobs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now, the fundamentals don't suggest any housing bubble, not in general for the U.S. economy,'' John Silvia, chief economist at Wachovia, said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States with weak jobs markets -- like Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania -- have experienced flat or declining home values, he said. But in areas like Washington, D.C., house prices have risen as expanded employment draws people there, he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes are recorded when deals close and reflect a purchase decisions several weeks old. New-home sales, which are logged before a builder breaks ground on a lot, are expected to show a dip when the data for June is reported on Tuesday.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By KATE MURPHY  </div><div>1162 words</div><div>25 July 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>13</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DALLAS -- SHE walks into a room and people nudge each other and whisper, ''It's Ebby.'' Crowds inevitably gather as admirers request a word or ask to have their picture taken with her. Though known by her first name, like Cher or Madonna, Ebby Halliday is not a rock star. She is a 93-year-old real estate mogul from Dallas who has reached iconic status.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ebby is a living legend in these parts,'' said John S. Baen, a professor of real estate at the University of North Texas in Denton. ''She was the first woman to enter what was a chauvinistic profession in a macho state.'' That was back in 1945, and ''she beat those ol' boys at their own game,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Ebby Halliday Realtors is the top locally owned residential real estate brokerage in Dallas, not to mention Texas, and ranked 23rd nationwide in sales, according to Real Trends Inc., a trade publishing and communications company based in Littleton, Colo. Ebby Halliday Realtors, which has 27 offices and 1,200 agents, had sales of around $3.8 billion last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drive around just about any residential neighborhood in the 12 counties that make up the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and Ebby emblazoned yard signs sprout like daisies on the front lawns. Her billboards line the highways and her picture is a fixture in the society pages of the local newspaper. ''I get around,'' said Ms. Halliday, who still drives to work every day in her sleek, gray Cadillac. Popular on the speaking circuit, she is met with roaring ovations when she addresses real estate associations, business groups, civic organizations and charities. ''People will actually stand in line to hear her,'' said Jan Hart Black, president of the Greater Dallas Chamber of Commerce.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With her big, white hair and penchant for playing the ukulele, she's a character even by Texas standards. Born Vera Lucille Hanson in 1911, Ms. Halliday grew up on a farm in Abilene, Kan. She became Ebby Halliday when she left home at age 21 to work at the hat counter in a Kansas City, Mo., department store. ''A Miss O'Shea in the couture department came up with the name,'' Ms. Halliday said. ''She told me Vera wouldn't get me anywhere.'' But with the name Ebby, she said, she was soon transferred to manage the hat department at a store in Omaha and finally relocated to a Dallas store in 1939.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Halliday gave up hats for houses in 1944 when a customer's husband issued her a challenge. He was a developer who had built 50 single-family insulated concrete houses north of Dallas that weren't moving because prospective buyers found them stark and unattractive. ''He told me that if I could sell all those crazy hats to his wife, maybe I could sell his crazy houses,'' she said. With her most expensive hats selling at $10.95 and the houses priced as high as $9,000, she saw an opportunity to boost her commissions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Ms. Halliday spent her savings covering the concrete floors and walls of one of the homes with carpet and cheery wallpaper and hanging cottage curtains -- essentially creating a show house before there was such a thing. She sold all the properties in nine months. ''I've never looked back,'' Ms. Halliday said. She opened her first office the next year and has since paced the growth of her business with the growth of Dallas and its suburbs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She has this incredible knack for picking the right markets; it's like she instinctively knows which areas are about to take off and opens an office there,'' said David L. Fair, chairman of the Hexter-Fair Title Company of Dallas, adding that it's no coincidence that his company will often open an office nearby.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though still very involved in the general planning and direction of her company, Ms. Halliday turned over day-to-day operations to the company president, Mary Frances Burleson, in 1993. ''Mary Frances came to me as a Kelly Girl secretary in 1958,'' Ms. Halliday said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Empowering women like Mrs. Burleson explains much of Ms. Halliday's success, said Dr. Baen of the University of North Texas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She gave women hope back when divorce or being a single working gal was a stigma'' and still is in certain social circles, he said. ''Ebby educated them and gave them a way to make a very good living.'' Not surprisingly, her employees tend to be highly motivated and fiercely loyal. More than 70 agents have been with the company for more than 25 years. Eighty percent of agents and full-time employees are female.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mary Kay used the same uplifting women strategy,'' Dr. Baen said, referring to Mary Kay Ash, the late founder of Mary Kay Cosmetics, also based in Dallas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Halliday has also been very active in Texas and national politics and knows the Bush family. ''Ebby and her husband were very well-connected and they were very smart in supporting politicians that would protect Realtor interests,'' said Dr. Baen, who is a commercial real estate broker as well as a professor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Halliday married Maurice Acers in 1965 at age 54. A former F.B.I. agent and executive assistant to Gov. Allan Shivers of Texas in the 1950's, Mr. Acers had a wide range of business interests throughout the state. He died in 1993. ''He was the love of my life,'' Ms. Halliday said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Ebby Halliday Realtors is undeniably a product of her vision and persona, Ms. Halliday said, ''I've always thought of this as a team operation.'' That's why she said she has never considered selling out to her many dogged suitors, including Merrill Lynch, Coldwell Banker and Prudential. ''This company is going to the people who helped me build it,'' Ms. Halliday said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has already conferred 49 percent of the company's privately held stock to the management and employees. The remaining 51 percent will be transferred upon her death.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she was asked if she worried about rising interest rates; accounting troubles at the government-backed mortgage finance companies, Freddie Mac and the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae; and whispers of a housing bubble, Ms. Halliday's bright eyes narrowed and her broad smile tightened slightly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been around a long time and we've survived many turndowns,'' she said, recalling the double-digit interest rates of the 70's and the oil bust and savings and loan scandals of the 80's. ''If things get tough, we just turn up the steam and charge ahead.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A front-page chart in this section last Sunday about changes in regional home values over the decades misstated the year that the Phebe Comstock House in Norwalk, Conn., sold for $124,500. It was 1979, not 1999. CORRECTED 7/26/04.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE is no way to convert into current dollars the price of ''60 pounds lawful money'' paid in 1781 for the Phebe Comstock House in Silvermine, Conn. But while its appreciation over its first two centuries is difficult to track, the two-story clapboard house with an open-hearth fireplace and dormer windows increased in value by 143.8 percent, when adjusted for inflation, between 1971 and 2001, when it last sold for $442,500.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may seem a stretch to cite a Revolutionary-era homestead as an illustration of long-term property appreciation, but the example is not so farfetched. By and large, house values in the New York metropolitan region have taken long strides over the decades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate gains in many parts of the city and its suburbs have been higher than those that were typical for the nation as a whole. That sets the metropolitan region apart, too, from average statewide appreciation. Gains in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in general lagged or barely exceeded the national median.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted for inflation, the median home price in the nation rose 168.5 percent from 1950 to 2000. In New York State, the increase was 141.8 percent; in New Jersey, 170.9 percent, and in Connecticut, 132.3 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the counties in and around New York City did far better. Using decade-by-decade Census Bureau data going back to 1950, James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, has traced the broadest trends in home prices in the region and the nation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Despite cycles of lagging and surging values, relative to the nation as a whole there have been extraordinary gains in value in the region over the last half century,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bergen County, for example, the median home value over those 50 years rose 220 percent, adjusted for inflation. In Westchester, it climbed 207 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan, not surprisingly, outstripped them all: over those five decades its median home value increased by 721 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By way of illustration, Jonathan Miller, president of the Miller Samuel appraisal company in Manhattan, searched the records on a two-bedroom apartment in a 21-story, 159-unit co-op at 860 Fifth Avenue that sold for $22,400 when the building opened in 1949.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sold for $530,000 in May 1984, he said, for $900,000 in June 1996, for $1.3 million in July 1998 and, most recently, for $1.5 million in January 2002. That constituted, over those 53 years, a 785.9 percent increase in inflation-adjusted value.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Van Winkle, president of A. W. Van Winkle &amp; Company in Rutherford, N.J., knows something about long-term value. His company was founded by his great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, Waling Jacob Van Winkle, in 1692.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardly going back that far, a four-bedroom Cape at 158 Highland Cross in Rutherford -- described by Mr. Van Winkle as ''a very typical post-World War II, returning veteran's house'' -- sold for $7,500 in 1948. In May 2002, it sold for $252,000. And seven months later, the owners ''flipped it,'' he said, for $270,000. So, over that 54-year period, it increased by an inflation-adjusted 382.3 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But how does housing stack up against other investments -- for instance, the stock market? To make the comparison, Dr. Hughes traced the Dow Jones industrial average and data from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which tracks price changes for the same housing units, from 1980 through the first quarter of this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In 1980, the Dow was at 830,'' Dr. Hughes said. ''In 2004, it has been running between 10,000 and 10,500. Rounded off, that's about a 1,100 percent gain.'' Home prices in New York State over the same period, by comparison, increased 400 percent, according to the federal data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So, on the surface, it looks like you would have done better in the stock market,'' Dr. Hughes said. ''However, that does not take into account the ability to leverage your initial housing investment.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words -- keeping the numbers simple -- assume you bought a $100,000 home in 1980. ''By 2004, it would have increased to $400,000 in value,'' Dr. Hughes said. ''Thus your gain would have been $300,000.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''However, assuming you only made a 10 percent down payment on the home -- or $10,000 -- that means your initial $10,000 investment grew to $310,000,'' he said. ''That's a gain of about 3,000 percent, which is far better than the stock market. If you had invested the $10,000 in stocks, it would have grown to $110,000 in the same 24-year period.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So that indicates the effect of leveraging your initial housing investment into a much larger value through borrowing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, of course, other factors to consider in comparing housing leverage and capital gains. ''Obviously, you have to pay the mortgage each month over the 24 years,'' Dr. Hughes said. ''However, that is generally not appreciably different from what you would have paid in rent if you hadn't bought the home.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, at the same time, a home buyer receives income-tax benefits because of interest-rate and property-tax deductions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also to be taken into account is the fact that people's ability to pay for a home has also climbed over the years. In 1953, the median family income for the Northeast region was $4,575; in 2000, it was $57,000 -- a 121.8 percent increase when adjusted for inflation. That 1953 income could buy a lot more than one would think, looking at today's prices. In 1950 a basic Ford coupe cost $1,333, a quart of milk cost 20 cents and the tab for a salad lunch in the Palm Court at the Plaza Hotel was $1.50.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A particularly considerable factor to weigh is the volatility of the investment. ''While housing prices have, obviously, gone down during certain periods,'' Dr. Hughes said, ''their volatility is nowhere near that of the stock market in general, and of individual stocks. While losses are possible in housing, very rarely will you confront a complete wipeout, which is always possible in the stock market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some cautionary notes were offered by Joseph S. Tracy, a senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, particularly on individual expectations drawn from broad geographical price data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Each share of stock in a company is interchangeable with any other, so the price is going to be the same,'' Dr. Tracy said. ''But every house is sort of unique, in its location and other attributes. So there can be a lot of individual price variations within a housing market. We must be careful when using these price indices to infer what you should expect from your own investment.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So part of the equation must be the cost of adding a bedroom, installing a pool, a major renovation and, perhaps, all those coats of paint over the decades. You don't, after all, have to paint your portfolio; on the other hand, you can't live in it either.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, while it's one thing for the homeowner who stays in place, it can be a completely different picture for someone who moves often. ''If I get a job opportunity in, let's say, Houston, then most likely I'm going to have to sell my house in order to accept that job,'' said Dr. Tracy. ''And it may not be the best time to sell in the current housing market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, a one-bedroom apartment at 11 Riverside Drive, near 73rd Street in Manhattan, sold for $180,000 in 1985. Ten years later, at the bottom of the region's most recent real estate slump, it sold for $167,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pointing out that some people lost all their equity during that downturn, Dr. Tracy said, ''If you know you can stay, that's the thing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence of staying power: that Riverside Drive apartment sold again, a year ago, for $430,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Campbell, a professor of real estate finance at Hofstra University, points out that ''buying a home is an investment over which the investor has substantial control.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't do much to control the people who run I.B.M.,'' Dr. Campbell said, ''but I can make good decisions about the condition of my home, thereby increasing the value. I can even exercise some influence on the community and the schools by participating in neighborhood organizations, which also increases value.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So particularly for people who remain in their home for a long time, and don't incur repeated transaction costs, Dr. Campbell continued, ''it's an investment with overall very reliably positive returns.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the professor pointed out, a three-bedroom colonial at 10 Brookwood Street in Glen Head on Nassau County's North Shore first sold for $2,900 in 1939. ''The lady who purchased the property back then is the same person who sold it in 1991 for $170,000 -- a tidy little profit,'' he said. It is now on the market for $580,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another house for sale in Long Island is a three-bedroom Tudor at 15 Tarence Street in Rockville Centre that sold for $4,000 in 1944 sold again in 1954 for $13,500, in 1967 for $22,500, and is now on the market at $550,000. If it goes for that price, as Dr. Campbell thinks it might, that would be an increase of 1,179.7 percent, adjusted for inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relatively new homes have also shown significant appreciation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the once desolate South Bronx, a two-bedroom condominium in the Melrose Court development on Brook Avenue that went for $55,000 in 1991 recently sold for $110,000 -- a 44.1 percent increase when adjusted for inflation, according to Mario Procida, president of the Procida Realty &amp; Construction Corporation, which specializes in affordable housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And at that 223-year-old home in Silvermine, Conn., its current owner, Anne Carbone, a member of the Norwalk Historical Society, traces a price trajectory that, though not without dips, has continued to climb.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After ''60 pounds lawful money'' in 1781, the 13-acre Comstock house -- including a cottage for the last slave in Connecticut history -- sold for $900 in 1824; for $812 in 1844; and, suffering from post-Civil War depression, for $650 in 1866.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by 1971, though by then reduced to less than an acre, the property sold for $41,500. And now, three years after she paid $442,500 for the house, Ms. Carbone -- who sometimes dons a settler's drawstring chemise, black boots and bonnet while entertaining in her home -- has high hopes for a future price, though she's not about to leave.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My friend, who's a Realtor, told me it's gone up quite a bit since I moved in,'' said Ms. Carbone, who usually dresses in the more contemporary costume of a financial services adviser. ''I ask, 'How much?' He says, 'Are you going to sell?' I say, 'No.' He says, 'Don't ask.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble with asking, of course, is that the lure of profit can overwhelm the reality that people have to live someplace. But should she decide to put it on the market, her friend the broker, Bill Axness of Coldwell Banker in Norwalk, estimated that it would probably go for ''in excess of half a million.''  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The Sale Prices Of Apartments In Manhattan Keep On Rising  </span>
</div><div class="author">By JOSH BARBANEL  </div><div>409 words</div><div>13 July 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of Manhattan apartments continued their rapid ascent in the first half of the year, with the average selling price of condominiums approaching $1.25 million, according to a new market snapshot. The average price marked a 38 percent jump from the same period a year ago, an increase due in part to the sale of more high-end apartments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-op prices increased as well, but more modestly. The average price increased 19 percent to $858,000. The biggest increases were seen in studios, which increased by 20 percent, and in two-bedroom apartments, which increased by 18 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new sales figures were released yesterday by the Corcoran Group, a day before a similar study is due out from a competitor, Douglas Elliman. The surveys provide the first inkling of the possible effects of rising interest rates on what has been one of the hottest real estate markets in the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corcoran survey, based on completed sales reported by brokers throughout Manhattan, found that about half the increase in condo prices was due to the increasing strength in the upper-end market. The average price for a two-bedroom condo rose by 25 percent to $1.28 million, while the average price of apartments of three bedrooms or more rose by 32 percent to $2.721 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We still have an oversupply of buyers over sellers, especially in the largest apartments and most desirable neighborhoods,'' said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive officer of the Corcoran Group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Liebman said that much of the surge in prices occurred over the winter, setting the tone for 2004 as ''an incredibly strong year,'' as former renters rushed to buy and affluent Wall Street investors decided to put money into high-end real estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, she said, the supply of apartments for sale began to rise, especially among smaller apartments, as interest rate increases and higher prices persuaded some renters to sign new leases. Even so, the prices of condominium studios over the six-month period were up 11 percent over the same period in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hard-to-find apartments, apartments with something special -- a park view, a terrace, or a prime neighborhood -- are still creating a frenzy,'' she said. ''You would think we were giving something away. You have open houses, and 70 people show up and 9 or 10 make bids.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANAHEIM, Calif. -- For years, Ray and Shahrazad Daneshi sought to buy a home, only to be told that they did not earn enough to qualify for a mortgage. But they recently managed to buy a small house in the shadow of Disneyland for $360,000 -- six times their annual income -- thanks to a lender who allowed them to borrow the entire value of the home, with no down payment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will not be going to any movies or eating out at restaurants,'' said Mr. Daneshi, a self-employed wedding photographer who came here from Iran in 1988. ''But in two years, the house will be worth a lot more and we will have something to show for it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Daneshis' purchase underscores the new, ever-optimistic economics of home buying. A kaleidoscopic array of mortgages for people with little cash or overstretched budgets has enabled families of modest income to take on debt that once would have been beyond their reach. As long as new home buyers could count on rock-bottom interest rates and housing values were going nowhere but up, this seemed to be a virtuous circle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, with the Federal Reserve expected to embark on a series of interest rate increases starting with its meeting on June 30, some experts worry that recent first-time buyers could find easy home ownership a lot harder on their wallets, possibly causing housing prices to wobble in some high-price markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Daneshis, for example, rising interest rates on the two adjustable-rate mortgages they took out to buy their house would mean that their monthly payment of $2,500 -- already more half their monthly income -- could go up substantially in two years. Mr. Daneshi realizes that, but is unconcerned.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why worry?'' he said, adding that he believes rising home prices will help him obtain a better loan deal by then.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With interest rates going up, that may be wishful thinking. Most analysts agree that there is no nationwide housing bubble because housing prices have climbed only slowly in the Midwest and the South, even as they have soared on the East and West Coasts. Still, if rising interest rates cause housing prices to drop, even slightly, industry officials warn that some new buyers will have no equity in their homes and could choose to walk away from their loans if they run into trouble with payments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of these loans are dangerous,'' said Allen Jackson, manager of Bristol Home Loan in Bellflower, Calif., a mortgage broker who specializes in so-called subprime loans, which charge higher interest rates to people unable to qualify for traditional mortgages. ''If you have any dip in values, people can just say the heck with it because they don't have any of their own money in the house.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders have aggressively encouraged home buyers to stretch in ways that would have been unimaginable a decade ago. In the new world of flexible mortgage lending, it is possible to buy a $600,000 house with no down payment, and to pay only interest and nothing on the principal for years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The financing has changed everything,'' said Humid Karat, a manager of Tarbell Realty's office in Anaheim. ''Ten years ago, if I offered to buy your house with a 100 percent loan, you would have called it 'creative financing' and thought I was crooked. Today, everybody wants a 100 percent loan.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volume of subprime mortgages, primarily for people with poor credit ratings, has risen sharply, as indicated by securities backed by the mortgages. Such securities soared to a total of $195 billion in 2003 from $17 billion in 1995, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry research firm in Bethesda, Md. Securities backed by unconventional mortgages, like no-money-down loans, climbed to nearly $80 billion from less than $1 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Underwriting standards have loosened to almost historic levels,'' said Bill Dallas, a pioneer in no-money-down loans and a board member of the California Mortgage Bankers Association. ''Nobody is heeding the yield signs.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say these novel techniques have democratized the access to credit and home ownership. The overall rate of ownership climbed to nearly 69 percent in 2003 from 64 percent in 1994. Home ownership among blacks rose to 48 percent from 42.2 percent. Among Hispanics, it was up to 46.4 percent from 41.1 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the experts worry that problems may be just over the horizon, especially in markets where housing prices have risen far faster than personal income. Here in Orange County, one of the frothiest markets of all, the median price of a single-family home is $572,000, up 28 percent in the last year alone.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the New York area, the median home price -- half were less expensive, half more expensive -- rose 88 percent from 1998 to 2003, to $353,000 from $188,100; in Miami, prices jumped to $226,800 from $121,500. The median home price for the Washington area increased to $286,200 from $172,100.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs that the frenzy has not yet reached a peak abound in Southern California. In Ladera Ranch, a planned community in the southern part of Orange County, more than 1,000 people are on a waiting list for the chance to buy one of 27 unbuilt three-bedroom houses at prices starting in ''the low $400,000's.'' In San Bernardino County, where some commute as long as two hours a day to jobs in Los Angeles and elsewhere, a five-bedroom tract house that sold for $378,000 a year ago is on the market again for $609,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, chief economist at the research firm Economy.com, estimates that about a third of the nation's housing is now overpriced and poised for at least a mild drop in values as the Fed begins to push up rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there is a risk that the situation could turn into something a lot worse. ''If there is a fissure in the economic system, it's in housing,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''This is a big, rapidly growing market that has not been tested by higher interest rates. Many people got into their houses by the skin of their teeth.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southern California is at the leading edge. People with poor credit ratings or low incomes can take out subprime mortgages at high interest rates. Those with good credit but erratic earnings can get what are called no-document loans, in which they do not have to prove their incomes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By any measure, such innovations have vastly expanded the availability of credit over the last decade, making it possible for people previously shut out of the market to share in the dream of home ownership.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Thanks to God for finding me a mortgage program that let me buy my own house,'' Mr. Daneshi said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife, a seamstress at Disneyland, had lived for years in a cramped apartment with their autistic son. They took out two mortgages this month, one for $280,000 at 6 percent and the second mortgage for $80,000 at 10.25 percent. Both are adjustable after two years, and the payments are virtually certain to rise, meaning that their budget will be further pinched unless their income rises, too.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they are hardly alone in stretching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Christian, 33, a controller at a stock brokerage firm, is buying a four-bedroom house for $620,000. Mr. Christian, who earns $160,000 a year, is also borrowing the entire purchase price. To keep his monthly payments down to $3,700, he is taking out an interest-only loan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Christian is already bracing for higher monthly payments. His mortgage will adjust to prevailing interest rates after three years, which he expects will be higher. ''I'm figuring that my income will have climbed by then as well,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices have climbed so rapidly in the last few months that banks are refusing to appraise some properties as high as their selling prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Tracy, a graphic designer, recently agreed to buy a condominium in Los Angeles for $235,000. But the same property had exchanged hands less than a year before for $114,000, and no appraiser would value it at more than $195,000. Ms. Tracy bought the condo anyway, but only after coming up with the extra cash to bridge the gap.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big question is whether prices will remain so high once the Fed begins raising interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents and many homeowners here vividly remember that Southern California housing prices soared in the 1980's and then fell in the early 90's -- the bubble ruptured by a combination of rising rates and a severe contraction in the region's aerospace and armaments industries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, interest rates are clearly heading up, but employment is climbing and economic growth appears strong. As a result, the Fed is widely expected to start raising rates at the end of this month, and some analysts worry that it may have to raise rates more sharply than originally planned to keep inflation under control.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi, of Economy.com, said that in overheated markets like Southern California, housing prices could easily drop at least 5 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage brokers who help people qualify for bigger loans, acknowledge that they are nervous. But for the moment, they are pressing ahead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What can I do?'' asked Mr. Jackson, the manager of Bristol Home Loan, the subprime loan specialist. ''My job is to help people realize the American dream.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increases in housing prices slowed in New Jersey in the first quarter of 2004, but the general trend is still upward. According federal figures, prices of single-family homes in New Jersey rose on average only 0.63 percent in the first quarter. That slightly lagged the national rate of 0.96 percent for the quarter ending March 31. But it still put the annual rate of increase in the state at 10.93 percent, versus a national average of 7.71 percent. New Jersey was eighth among the states in housing-price increases.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EAST PALO ALTO, Calif. -- MOSTAFA AMIRI moved to this little Silicon Valley city in 1980 and became the ice cream man, selling chocolate drumsticks to kids from his truck. That was dangerous enough, said his friends, who worried that anyone driving around with a lot of cash would be a prime target for crime. But when he proposed buying a home here, that was just too much. They begged him to reconsider.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They said, 'How can you live in the bullets?' '' Mr. Amiri said, speaking in the vernacular of his native Iran.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He ignored their admonitions, bought several houses in the late 1980's and early 1990's, and as a result, has become a millionaire. His fortunes underscore how Northern California's real estate market has transformed a city that a decade ago had the highest per capita murder rate in the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices for the ZIP code that includes East Palo Alto averaged $469,000 in the first quarter of this year, according to DataQuick Information Systems in San Diego. That is a 46.5 percent increase from 1992, the year that East Palo Alto -- home to around 30,000 residents -- endured 42 homicides, mostly related to drugs and gangs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate brokers, residents and city officials attribute the pricing change to a variety of factors, including a plummeting crime rate, thanks to community efforts and improved policing, and the opening on the edge of town of a shopping complex that includes a Home Depot and Ikea. But the overriding factor may simply be that, in the well-heeled Silicon Valley, East Palo Alto is a rare enclave of relative affordability.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighboring cities are among the country's most exclusive, with the average home price in the ZIP codes covering adjacent Palo Alto hitting $869,000 in the first quarter, according to DataQuick. So even though East Palo Alto's housing prices have risen faster than those of Palo Alto since 1988, it still is far more accessible to young couples and the region's service workers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no place else to go,'' said Alvin James, the city manager, adding that within East Palo Alto's 2.5 square miles are dozens of empty acres. ''We are sitting on the last bit of low-cost, undeveloped land,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In matters of affluence and education, East Palo Alto has lived in the long shadow of Silicon Valley. In proximity, it is a literal stone's throw from the wealthiest communities, resting directly across the freeway from Palo Alto, Atherton, and Menlo Park, where the captains of the technology industry live. The freeway has served as a kind of gate, relegating to the east side the crack trade and turf wars that erupted between gangs vying to control East Palo Alto.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, a shopping complex opened on the East Palo Alto side of the freeway, and brought a Baskin-Robbins store, a Starbucks, a California Bank and Trust, Circuit City and Home Depot, among other shops. Last September, an Ikea opened in the same shopping center, which has become valued by retailers because it is on the freeway that runs between San Jose and San Francisco, tying together some very affluent communities. By May 2005, a 200-room Four Seasons Hotel is scheduled to open in a neighborhood once known as Whiskey Gulch and rechristened University Circle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New housing developments came, too. Near Home Depot are 221 new single-family units, and 129 multifamily units, with the single-family homes selling for $600,000 to $700,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Amari, the former ice-cream man who now manages his properties, said the new developments allowed some prospective real estate buyers to feel more comfortable with East Palo Alto. He himself stands to profit handsomely from the change.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1989, he bought a three-bedroom, one-bathroom house for $67,000. It is now on the market for $525,000. In 1987, he bought a parcel on the same block that includes a three-bedroom house and two smaller homes -- one with two bedrooms and a one-bedroom studio. And in 1993, he paid $110,000 for what he said was a former crack house in foreclosure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new buyers moving to East Palo Alto are not primarily engineers and managers moving from the other side of the freeway. Rather, according to Mr. James, the city manager, the existing housing stock is being bid up by the people who perform manual labor for Silicon Valley.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. James said East Palo Alto has become home to large Hispanic families who have six or more residents sharing a house to afford the mortgage. ''Stated or unstated, there is a need for people who do the gardening in Silicon Valley,'' Mr. James said. ''East Palo Alto is a working-class city. That's the role it's playing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Caucasians are moving in around the edges, said Jimmy Oyenuga, a real estate agent who has worked in the city since 1989. He said that the new housing developments, like the one beside Home Depot, have a demographic of buyers that is ''99.9 percent white.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes have wrought a new generation of race politics in the city. Some residents have been upset that the new housing developments are like gated communities and have not integrated with East Palo Alto.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One owner of a home in a new development about six blocks from the freeway is Brian Bushnell, 56, an elevator mechanic. Mr. Bushnell said he chose the development because East Palo Alto is centrally located and less expensive than neighboring communities. In January, he paid $615,000 for a 2,350-square-foot home that he said would have been twice as much on the other side of the freeway.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bushnell said he remains wary of ongoing crime issues in the community. Although murders are down, there have been two homicides this year and an armed robbery of the bank branch.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, William Vines, a former councilman, sold a house in a small development he created to Peter Kim, 54, for $665,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kim said he is pleased with his four-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath home. And Mr. Vines said he is too, with perhaps one caveat. ''I wish I could have afforded to buy more property,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photos: A PLACE FOR THE MIDDLE AND WORKING CLASS -- Mostafa Amiri at one of his five houses, at left.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAS VEGAS, May 29 -- One lure that has made moving to southern Nevada so irresistible to so many striving Americans for so long -- the prospect of owning a bigger or cheaper house -- is disappearing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas and its suburbs have been a housing bargain for more than three decades. But now houses here cost about as much as houses in Chicago, Denver or Baltimore. The median cost of a house here is 32 percent above the national median, according to a survey by the National Association of Realtors; until three years ago, houses here were cheaper than they were nationally. And the once ubiquitous dream home that sold for under $150,000 is getting hard to find. The median price of an existing house is $224,900, roughly the price of a new house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Las Vegas was a small town, and suddenly it is becoming a big city and running into the big-city effect,'' said S. Lawrence Yun, a senior economist with the association. ''With more crowding, the value of the land gets pushed up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising house prices may have helped turn back the tide of newcomers somewhat, with fewer people arriving here in 2003 than in 2002. Still, Nevada remains the fastest-growing state in the nation, but the demographic profile of the new arrivals is changing. Three of every five new residents now come from California, where housing prices still make those here seem like a bargain.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of houses in the Las Vegas area that sold in the first three months of this year rose by 31 percent compared with the same period last year, the second highest increase in the country, according to the Realtors association. New subdivisions here have waiting lists of six to nine months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have never seen a market like this,'' said Lee K. Barrett, president of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors. ''My concern as a businessman is we need to be working on affordable housing. We are seeing people priced out.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it looks as if the desert surrounding Las Vegas goes on forever, some builders here estimate that the available land for new housing will run out in 7 to 10 years. Most of the land is federally owned. In 1998, Congress authorized the sale of 55,000 acres, much of it at public auctions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the market grows hotter, the price of the federal land goes up. The Bureau of Land Management will hold an auction on Wednesday that includes 1,940 acres in Henderson, a booming suburb. The land today is appraised at $250 million, or about $129,000 per acre. At the first bureau auction, in 1999, the land for sale was about 40 percent cheaper.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">What a Million Dollars Will Buy You   </span>
</div><div class="author">By CARIN RUBENSTEIN   </div><div>1653 words</div><div>30 May 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE house may be selling for more than $1 million, but it's still just a teardown.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-bedroom house in Old Greenwich shares a driveway on a barely paved dead-end lane and sits on almost a half-acre. It has partial water views of Greenwich Cove, but the exterior is slightly mildewed and the concrete landings are crumbling. That hardly matters, though, since the $1.725 million dollar home is scheduled to be demolished.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes they bring the wrecking ball to the closing,'' said John W.M. Cooke, only half joking, the listing agent for the house and manager of Merritt Associates, a real estate agency in Greenwich.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, in this part of Connecticut, he said, ''One million dollars doesn't buy you much house. I've never seen it like this; it's like Monopoly money.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cooke said one Greenwich home that recently sold for $1.4 million had some unusual qualities, but he admitted ''if you showed that million-dollar house to somebody in Iowa, they'd think you were crazy.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a few other communities, including Darien and Westport, $1 million barely buys a starter home. Indeed, a growing number of home buyers in and around lower Fairfield County are entering the million-dollar home market, whether they expect to or not.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten years ago, $1 million bought a ''pretty high-end home, but $1 million now is pretty much entry level,'' said Mary Palmieri Gai, a broker at William Raveis in Westport. ''A million buys a tired house on half an acre or less that is waiting to be knocked down,'' she added.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlotte Felt, manager of Kelly Associates Real Estate in Darien, said $1 million will buy a four-bedroom colonial style house on half an acre in Darien, while 10 years ago, that much money would have purchased a 16-room home on two acres.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, in the first quarter of 2004, 48 percent of the single-family homes sold in Darien went for more than $1 million, as did 66 percent of those sold in New Canaan. In fact, the average price of single-family homes exceeds $1 million in Greenwich, Westport, Darien and New Canaan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Greenwich, the average sale price of single family homes went over $1 million in 1997; the average price in the first quarter of 2004 was $2 million, according to Mr. Cooke. In New Canaan, too, the average price is now $1.9 million; the average price first topped $1 million there in 1999. In both Westport and Darien, the average price of single family homes hit the $1 million mark for the first time in 2002.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many real estate experts said high prices for single-family homes was due to extraordinarily low interest rates and a historically low level of inventory.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1990's, not even 1 percent of homes in Fairfield County sold for $1 million or more, said Don Hull, president of the Connecticut Multiple Listing Service, which tracks housing prices in the Fairfield area, excluding Greenwich, Darien and New Canaan. But during the first quarter of 2004, 9 percent of the 1,326 single-family homes sold in 20 towns in Fairfield County went for at least $1 million, he said. With the addition of Greenwich, Darien and New Canaan, that figure rises to 27 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ten years ago, a $1 million house was very much a rarity,'' Mr. Hull said. But today, million-dollar plus prices no longer surprise him, he added.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Real estate values double every seven years, and God hasn't created any more land, so you've got supply and demand,'' Mr. Hull said, in trying to explain the increase in seven-figure home prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the National Association of Realtors in Washington, which charts housing sales nationwide, does not even track homes that sell for more than $1 million, since ''it's fewer than 1 percent of transactions,'' said Walter Molony, a spokesman.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With some notable exceptions. In several metropolitan areas nationwide, million dollar homes are becoming commonplace.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cambridge, Mass., for example, nearly 12 percent of single-family homes were valued at more than $1 million, as were 7 percent of those in San Francisco and 3 percent of those in Stamford, according to data drawn from the 2000 Census by Zhu Xiao Di, a research analyst at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. Although he did not examine figures for other parts of Connecticut, Mr. Di said that he is not surprised by the large number of million-dollar homes there.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In places where housing demand exceeds supply, and there is little open land to build more, ''one million dollars does not purchase a huge mansion, just a standard thing,'' he said. Mr. Di's study focused on owner-occupied single-family homes and thus excluded New York City's co-ops and condos.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proportion of million dollar homes, however, varies widely across municipalities in southern Connecticut, as well as across the New York metropolitan region as a whole.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Greenwich, for instance, 64 percent of the single-family homes sold this year have been for more than $1 million, said Russell Pruner, a partner at Shore and Country Properties in Greenwich. Just across the New York State border, in Rye City, however, 38 percent of the homes sold in 2004 went for more than $1 million, according to George M. Stone, a co-owner of Julia B. Fee Real Estate in Rye. And across the Long Island Sound, in Nassau County, just 6 percent of home sales this year included those selling for more than $1 million, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This wide disparity stems in part from the fact that housing prices have always varied from community to community, but also because of differences in property and income taxes, as well as perceptions about school districts and community prestige.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In towns with a high proportion of million dollar homes, ''you pay for a certain exclusivity, and it's largely land values,'' said John Clapp, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of Connecticut who collects data on real estate statewide.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're paying for the neighborhood, the low tax rate, access to work places and recreation, and for the panache,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have risen in the New York metropolitan area substantially, ''especially in lower Fairfield County, and especially in terms of income,'' he said. Homes are becoming less affordable in the region as prices increase faster than income, added Mr. Clapp.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Million dollar homes also come with a special Connecticut state tax burden.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sellers of homes priced below $800,000 pay a real estate conveyance tax of 0.5 percent to the state, those who sell a home for more pay a 1 percent tax, a levy that was enacted in 1989, according to Sarah Kaufman, spokeswoman for the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services in Hartford.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fiscal 1997-1998, for instance, 1,934 homes in the state sold for more than $800,000, bringing in revenue of $34.1 million, Ms. Kaufman said. By fiscal 2002-2003, that number had increased to 2,740, bringing in $46.5 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many real estate agents in southern Connecticut said even $1 million is not really a standard by which a home becomes truly impressive.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes that induce a mild ''wow,'' said Mrs. Gai, sell for at least $2.5 million, but even then, ''brokers have become so jaded that it's the land that makes them say 'wow' and not the house.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One million dollars buys a perfectly lovely house, and if that's your dream house, that's your mansion,'' said Barbara Cleary, owner of Barbara Cleary's Realty Guild in New Canaan. But still, she acknowledged that a dream house, or a true mansion, would probably be a newly constructed home that would be priced between $2.5 and $3 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't say that $1 million makes a mansion, for sure,'' Mr. Clapp said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photos: This house in Old Greenwich, with partial water views, sold this month for $1.7 million and will be torn down. Above, a home in Westport for sale at $1.1 million.; This house in Westport is on more than an acre of land and is going for $2.3 million. From Jan. 1, 2003 to March 31, 2004, 46 percent of the homes sold in the town went for $1 million or more.

</div><div>By Bloomberg News</div>
<div>817 words</div><div>27 May 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes fell 11.8 percent last month, the largest decline in a decade, after mortgage rates reached a five-month high, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the Commerce Department said that orders for durable goods declined 2.9 percent in April after the biggest two-month gain since 1992, when such records were first kept.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in single-family home purchases was greater than expected, to 1.093 million at an annual pace, after a record 1.239 million pace in March. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast that sales of new homes would decline to a 1.2 million annual pace from 1.228 million the month before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales of previously owned houses rose 2.5 percent in April, to a 6.64 million annual pace, the second highest on record, a report yesterday from the National Association of Realtors showed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased in April to 5.83 percent, up from 5.45 percent in March, according to Freddie Mac, the No.2 purchaser of mortgages in this country. The median price of a new house increased to a record, and the supply of homes rose.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The price appreciation that we've seen is unsustainable,'' said Van Davis, chief executive of Century 21 Real Estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April sales of new homes fell in three regions of the United States and rose in one. They dropped 22 percent in the South, to 460,000 at an annual pace; 9.4 percent in the West, to a 339,000 pace; and 2.5 percent in the Northeast, to 78,000. Sales increased 10.8 percent in the Midwest, to a pace of 216,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales account for 15 percent of the market and are considered a harbinger of the market for sales of previously owned homes. New-home sales are counted when a contract is signed, while resales are tabulated at the contract's close.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the April decline, sales so far this year are at an annual pace of 1.283 million houses, which would exceed last year's record.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five chief economists from housing trade groups and mortgage-buying companies said in a report for the Homeownership Alliance yesterday that the construction of 1.85 million to 2.17 million homes a year would be needed for the next decade.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of new homes increased 8.8 percent last month, to $221,200 from $203,300 in March. Inventories of new homes for sale rose to a 4.3-month supply in April from 3.7 months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, known for hot real estate markets, home prices registered the second-biggest increase in 26 years in April, the state Association of Realtors said. The median price of an existing single-family detached home in California rose 24.6 percent from a year earlier, to $453,590.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April's decline in orders for durable goods, products intended to last at least three years, reflected less demand for commercial aircraft and automobiles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfilled orders to factories rose in April for an eighth month in nine, and there was an increase in shipments of business equipment, which economists expect to help fuel the economy this quarter. Manufacturers hired more workers last month than at any time in almost four years. In March, business inventories were at record lows compared with sales, recent reports show.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The slippage in orders in April looks modest and leaves volumes high enough to ensure continued expansion of production in the months ahead,'' said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International in New York.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at Bear Stearns said the value of nonmilitary capital-goods shipments excluding aircraft, a component in calculating the gross domestic product, was 15.8 percent higher at an annual pace than the first-quarter average.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength ''suggests that business-equipment spending will likely post another double-digit gain in the second quarter,'' John Ryding, Bear Stearns' chief market economist in New York, said.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOME home buyers are rushing into the market because mortgage rates have inched up by a percentage point since March, brokers throughout the New York region say. For precisely the same reason, they say, other buyers -- particularly skittish fledglings -- are cringing from taking the plunge.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And at the same time, some sellers who had been holding onto their properties to maximize a seemingly inexorable rise in prices have now made that phone call to a listing agent, suddenly wary that the housing market -- a reliable piston of the nation's economy even during recent sluggish times -- might go into a grind should interest rates take too many more upward ticks. As a result, listings have lurched up a bit in the last two months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or is it just spring?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are affected by sunlight,'' said Sari Kingsley, president of the Staten Island Board of Realtors. ''Listings have started to pour in. Then, maybe, it was just the lousy winter we had.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the heights of Manhattan's towers to the capes of the New Jersey coast, the market remains on an inventory-squeezed, high- and higher-priced roll, a boon to sellers (at least until they have to find new digs) and a bane to buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Brooklyn broker says buyers these days seem to move in flocks -- the same faces showing up at every open house; some people submitting defensive bids for a home not quite of their dreams, then slipping into buyer remorse and sometimes, just sometimes, backing out of the deal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary angst for buyers, of course, stems from still-rising prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average cost of a Manhattan apartment set a record during the first quarter of this year, coming in just short of $1 million at $998,905. Manhattan's median price of $625,000 also set a record during the first quarter, bounding up 21.4 percent from $515,000 in the first quarter of 2003. In the not-quite-as-rarefied environs along the southern tier of Brooklyn, the median home price during the first quarter of 2004 was $495,000, a 13 percent increase from the same period in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester's median price also hit an all-time high in the first quarter, $574,900, a 9 percent rise from a year ago. And in one of the hottest markets of northern New Jersey, Short Hills, the median was $1.35 million, a 28.5 percent escalation from $1.05 million a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'A Perverse Positive'  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Rates Rise, Market Heats Up  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some degree the volatility in the market is, rationally or not, related to the first significant mortgage-rate rise in several years. ''I'm starting to feel rumblings,'' said Dawn Roman, owner of Century 21 Dawn's Gold in Yonkers. ''People are worried about how long rates will stay down. Buyers and sellers fear their window of opportunity is closing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So throughout the region, in a perhaps counterintuitive effect on the long-term lack of inventory, previously-wait-and-see sellers are deciding it is now or never for that top dollar.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A perverse positive,'' said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, describing how, instead of inhibiting sales, higher rates are spurring the market. ''It's the fence-sitter phenomenon.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries about further rate increases have also generated some creative arrangements. ''One of my buyers wanted to protect himself from a June rate hike by closing and moving in right away,'' said Elayne Jassey, a broker for Coldwell Banker in Stamford, Conn., ''but the seller did not want to move out until Aug. 1.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They worked out a deal,'' Ms. Jassey continued, ''whereby the buyer paid $900,000 for the house, which the seller is leasing back from him for $4,000 a month. The seller has his money in hand and continues to pay about $1,000 a month in property taxes, and the buyer figures the amount he would be paying in higher interest for years to come will be his compensation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the run-up in mortgage rates has seized the attention of buyers as well as real estate specialists -- though its full impact is a matter of disagreement -- the higher rates have quickly generated one measurable effect: an increase in the popularity of adjustable-rate mortgages.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Across all markets in recent months there has been a continuing shift toward ARM's, which has accelerated in recent weeks,'' said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage research company in Pompton Plains, N.J. With rare exceptions, adjustable mortgages offer interest below the current 30-year fixed rate for a specific period of time, but the rate may then increase or decrease according to market conditions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the more favored products at the moment,'' Mr. Gumbinger said, ''is a 5/1 hybrid, whose rate is fixed for the first five years before adjusting'' yearly after that. As of May 14, according to the latest statistics available from the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, 35.2 percent of all mortgage applications were for ARM's, up from 26.3 percent on Feb. 6, and from 13.1 percent a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, to be sure, long-view real estate observers wondering whether all the interest-rate jitters are much ado about not all that much.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously, rates are increasing,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''But they are increasing from near-record lows in our lifetime. And even as they increase further, they probably will still not reach the level they were at in 2000, when the average rate on a conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 8.14 percent. And housing was certainly red hot then.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gumbinger at HSH Associates pointed out: ''We saw historic lows last June when 30-year fixed rates bottomed at 5.37 percent. Recent lows were 5.53 percent in March.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past Wednesday, the rate was 6.39 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The rates have risen,'' Mr. Gumbinger said, ''but they remain favorable compared with almost any point over the last 20 years.'' Ten years ago, the average 30-year fixed rate was 8.9 percent; 15 years ago, it was 11.03 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Perspective has become distorted in recent years by the prevalence of cheap money,'' Mr. Gumbinger said. ''Remember, in September 1981, 30-year fixed rates peaked at 18.31 percent, making today's rates look minuscule, even with the recent increase.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And certainly the housing market, regionally and nationally, has remained strong. According to the National Association of Realtors, there were 6.1 million sales of existing homes in 2003, a record. ''However,'' Dr. Hughes at Rutgers said, ''January and February of this year actually surpassed January and February of 2003.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seasonally adjusted rate for January and February of 2003 was 5.8 million sales, he pointed out, ''while in '04 we're ahead of that pace in the first two months with sales approaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.1 million.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For New York City, Long Island, northern New Jersey and western Connecticut, the realtors association data show, the median price climbed from $258,200 in 2001 to $309,800 in 2002 to $352,600 in 2003 -- a 36.5 percent increase in two years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the fourth quarter of last year alone, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (which does not provide dollar figures), prices rose 4.26 percent in Connecticut, and 5.51 percent in both New York and New Jersey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These all represented a sharp acceleration over the third quarter,'' Dr. Hughes said, ''and this was during the winter, one of the slower selling periods in the year.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If prices continue to increase at that rate,'' he added, ''fears of a bubble would be justified. But with interest rates rising, we may actually see a stabilizing effect.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan Trends  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices Go Up, Volume Goes Down  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bit of price stability would certainly be welcomed by Manhattan buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The record average of $998,905 in this year's first quarter, reported in the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Overview, constitutes a 10.6 percent jump just since the end of 2003, when the average was $903,259. And the median of $625,000 in the first quarter, also a record, was 7.8 percent higher than the $580,000 median at the end of last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales volume, indicative of the enduring Manhattan squeeze, dropped sharply during the first quarter. There were 1,825 closed deals by April 30, down 19.1 percent from 2,256 in the previous quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This was a result of the drop in inventory,'' said Jonathan Miller, president of the Miller Samuel appraisal company, which prepares the Elliman report. Listings dropped by 11.2 percent to 4,299 from 4,843 at the end of 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''However, during the last two months, we've seen inventory begin to rise,'' Mr. Miller said -- by 7.6 percent in March over February and by 20 percent to 5,159 in April.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That indicates the concerns over rising mortgage rates,'' Mr. Miller added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group, believes Manhattan buyers and sellers have their ''eye on the wrong ball.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She told of a buyer who signed a contract to pay $260,000 for a studio in an Upper West Side condominium, then backed out of the deal because of the rise in interest rates. ''So one month later,'' she said, ''he's out there looking for something cheaper, and everything's gone up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mostly,'' Ms. Corcoran said, ''people are rushing in as though it's the last chance at a Macy's Day sale. But very few people are asking: what does the one point rise actually mean in dollars and cents? They're having a knee-jerk reaction to their fear of rising rates.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My advice,'' she said, ''it's ridiculous to overreact to a one point rise when Manhattan apartment prices are going up 2 percent each month.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyer haste, on the other hand, can lead to buyer remorse, said Christopher Thomas, vice president for Brooklyn for the William B. May Company.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the recent uptick in inventory, said Mr. Thomas, whose firm specializes in the high end of brownstone Brooklyn: ''There are still many more purchasers than product. Buyers' frustration has led to a situation where they tend to move in flocks. They accumulate for a type of property, particularly our middle market: $600,000 to $800,000 for a two-bedroom. Many have bid unsuccessfully several times and are primed to move immediately on a new listing. ''The day the property is seen, they come in at 9 in the morning,'' he said, ''and by the end of the day competitive bids often drive the ultimate price above the initial offering.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some bids, however, are ''defensive.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The seller feels he's in the catbird seat with bids above asking price,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''But sometimes he can wind up accepting an offer from a buyer who in his heart is only lukewarm about the property. And if the deal is not consummated quickly, buyer remorse sets in. That buyer is gone, and so are all the other bidders.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, by and very largely, prices keep climbing. Mr. Thomas cited, for example, the $1.5 million sale last July of a historic single-family home in need of work in the Fort Greene section. ''For personal reasons, the purchasers decided to sell,'' he said. ''They put it on the market in January. By February, a deal was struck for over $1.8 million, a 30 percent increase in six months. And that's not an isolated example.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have also climbed, though not so precipitously, in other parts of Brooklyn. Gerard Longo, president of Madison Estates and Properties in the southern part of the borough, said that during the year that ended on April 30, his company closed 671 deals, 9.6 percent more than the 612 sales during the previous year. ''And while the median between May 1, 2002, and April 30, 2003, was $438,000,'' he said, ''for the last 12 months it was $495,000,'' a 13 percent increase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pointing to recent deals, he said that on May 7, a frame house in Bensonhurst with a three-bedroom apartment over a one-bedroom sold for $480,000. A semiattached three-bedroom in Bay Ridge sold for $547,500 on March 26. In Bedford-Stuyvesant, an attached two-family limestone sold on March 5 for $450,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Although rates have gone up,'' Mr. Longo said, ''it still makes sense for someone in Manhattan paying $3,000 rent to relocate to Brooklyn, purchase a $500,000 home, pay almost the same money and, on top of that, get the tax refund.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond Manhattan  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'I Want to Buy Now, No Matter What'  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though certainly not as fevered as in tonier sections of the city, the pattern of urgent demand, restricted listings and climbing prices was evident throughout the five boroughs and the suburban ring.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Queens, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, which includes the borough, the median price between Jan. 1 and April 30 this year was $388,000, 10.8 percent higher than the $350,000 median during the first four months of 2003. And 1,797 homes were sold in the borough from January through April, 10.7 percent more than the 1,623 sold during the corresponding period last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Staten Island, Rich Schulhoff, a spokesman for the borough's board of realtors, said that between Jan. 1 and May 12 of this year, there were 1,344 homes sold at a median price of $339,900. Last year through the same period, there were 1,255 homes sold at a median of $299,000 -- a 13.3 percent price rise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, according to the state's association of realtors, the median for single-family homes was $334,300 during the first quarter of 2004, a 10.6 percent increase over $302,300 a year ago. The highest increase was seen in Monmouth and Ocean Counties, combined, where the median climbed 16.6 percent from $255,500 to $298,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Otteau Appraisal Group, which surveys 18 of the state's 21 counties, 21,387 homes went into contract during the first quarter of this year, 16 percent more than the 18,381 a year ago. ''The sales increase, coupled with a 5 percent reduction in inventory, just keeps pushing prices higher,'' said the company's president, Jeffrey Otteau.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supply is so tight, said Ronnie Laiken, president of Coldwell Banker's 60 offices in New Jersey, that ''if a home comes on the market in move-in condition, people are lined up for it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And if a house comes on not in move-in condition, and the price reflects that, people are waiting for that, too,'' she added. ''This market has eliminated the hopes of some people to get into their dream house.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen Bigos, an agent in the Millburn-Short Hills office of Burgdorff ERA, said that after bidding wars, ''one in three deals falls apart after the contract is signed because buyers are unable to secure financing. In those cases, the other bidders are contacted and allowed to renew their offers before the house is placed back on the market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester, P. Gilbert Mercurio, vice president of the county's board of realtors, said the median price of single-family homes reached an all-time high of $574,900 during the first quarter, a 9 percent rise from $527,000 a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Roman, the owner of the Century 21 office in Yonkers, said: ''These days, even on co-ops, there's no negotiating. It's just the highest and best offer.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pricing in Nassau and Suffolk had been fairly stable between October and January, said Joseph Mottola, chief executive of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. But then . . .  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the average price for a Nassau home was $481,300; in April, it was $537,500, an 11.6 percent jump. In Suffolk, the average price in April was $417,100, up 9.5 percent from $380,000 in January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is because as interest rates go up, people are committing,'' Mr. Mottola said. ''They're saying, 'I want to buy now, no matter what.' So they're losing their negotiating strength.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comprehensive statistics for western Connecticut were not available. But in Stamford, for example, the median price during the first quarter of this year was $606,000, 10.2 percent higher than $550,000 a year ago. And in Greenwich, the median price of $1.15 million during the first quarter of 2003 crept up to $1.675 million this year -- a mere 45.7 percent -- according to Jackie Hammock, a broker at Coldwell Banker in Greenwich. ''It's because we have had so many high-end sales this year,'' she said. ''The big boys are really out spending bonus money.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is all the frenzy worth it?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the long run, yes, insists Ms. Kingsley of the Staten Island Board of Realtors. ''Homeownership lets you build wealth over the years,'' she said. ''It's mental security, it centers you, it keeps you stable.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hughes at Rutgers backs that up with numbers. ''In the tristate region, home prices have tripled in a little more than two decades,'' he said. In New York State, since 1980, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, home values rose 393 percent; in New Jersey, 314 percent; in Connecticut, 271 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even in inflation-adjusted terms, they more than doubled'' in the region over all, Dr. Hughes said -- in New York, by 134 percent; in New Jersey, by 96 percent and in Connecticut, by 76 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Homeowners,'' Dr. Hughes said, ''were richly rewarded just for being alive.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting on signs that the long-hoped-for renewal of Asbury Park, N.J., is starting to catch on, a developer plans to turn an empty office building into 25 condominiums and build an adjacent building with 25 more residences on a block sandwiched between this faded resort city's recovering downtown and its oceanfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work will start in two weeks on the $7 million-plus conversion of the six-story 1920's building at 501 Grand Avenue, once the headquarters of <span class="companylink">Jersey Central Power and Light</span>. Renamed Asbury Grand, it will be reshaped into 900- to 1,500-square-foot apartments, some with ocean views. There will also be 5,500 square feet of ground-level commercial space as part of the conversion, which is being designed by WORK, a Manhattan architectural firm, and is to be completed by the first quarter of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of the new building will not start until most or all of the residences in the conversion are sold, said Harvey Schultz, a principal of Asbury Grand Partners, the developer. Other principals include Frank Mandia and the Murnick family, who had owned the land as well as the limestone-colored brick building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schultz, who grew up near Asbury Park, said the amount of development taking place now persuaded the partners to invest in the city. ''It has started to come back,'' said Mr. Schultz, who also is a principal of the Schultz Organization/TCN Worldwide, a commercial real estate services company in Woodbridge, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the more than 30 years since race riots drove out much of Asbury Park's middle class, there have been a few unsuccessful plans for its rebound. But in the last 18 months, the 12-block central business district, which had become a virtual ghost town, has slowly revived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Gilmour, the city's director of economic development, said that in that time 38 businesses had opened in formerly boarded-up downtown buildings, while the upper floors were being turned into housing, mainly condos. He added that 244 residences had been completed or were under way or about to begin, with most of the rest of the downtown buildings spoken for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the larger developments is the conversion to 61 rental apartments of the vacant Steinbach department store, formerly the Commercial Hotel, on Cookman Avenue. The transformation of the five-story, 19th-century building, which is listed on both the State and National Registers of Historic Places, is to begin next month, said Carter S. Sackman, a principal of Emory Realty of Manhattan, the developer. An average 1,000-square-foot apartment will rent for $1,300 to $1,500 a month, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also are signs of success from the current $1 billion mixed-use redevelopment plan for the oceanfront and several nearby blocks. One is that Asbury Partners, the city-designated master redeveloper of the 56-acre redevelopment area, will complete the restoration of the nearly milelong boardwalk by July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, work is to start late this summer on the first 146 town houses and condos of the 3,000 residences planned for the redevelopment area. They are expected to sell at prices starting from mid-$300,000's for the condos and in the $400,000 range for the town houses, according to the developer, the <span class="companylink">Kushner Companies</span> of Florham Park, N.J. Those residences will rise on two blocks between Cookman and Lake Avenues along Wesley Lake at the southern end of the redevelopment area. Kushner will ultimately build 750 residences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the northern end of the redevelopment area, Paramount Homes of Jackson Township, N.J., will start construction in November on 153 waterfront condos. Prices are expected to range from $400,000 to $800,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schultz, the developer of the Asbury Grand, said the location of the Grand Avenue building and lot was a key to his decision to proceed. The properties are near the ocean and downtown, and two blocks from the <span class="companylink">New Jersey Transit</span> train station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Brown, a sales associate at the residential brokerage firm Gloria Nilson/GMAC who is marketing the conversion, said that last year 64 condos were sold downtown for $100,000 to $375,000, up from the 29 apartments that sold the previous year for $104,000 to $215,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices at the Asbury Grand have not yet been finally set, he said, but an average 1,100-square-foot apartment is expected to sell for $330,000. Sales are to start by July.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, May 18 -- Starts of new housing decreased in April, but permits to build homes exceeded expectations as builders anticipated steady demand underpinned by mortgage rates still relatively low.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report from the Commerce Department showed on Tuesday that home builders broke ground at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.969 million units last month, down 2.1 percent from an upward-revised 2.011 million in March. Analysts had expected housing starts at a pace of 1.99 million units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are a little lower than expected,'' said Richard Egelton, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Montreal, ''but they are still at pretty stratospheric levels.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, a sign of builder confidence, climbed to 1.999 million units in April, compared with an upward-revised pace of 1.975 million the month before. Analysts had expected permits to remain steady at some 1.95 million units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank UBS, in an economic report, said, ''A recent rush to buy homes, telegraphed by yesterday's solid reading on the home builders survey and recent strong mortgage applications, suggests starts will stay robust near term, partly as buyers rush to avoid yet higher mortgage rates ahead.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders said its housing index, a gauge of builder sentiment on sales and buyer traffic, registered 69 for May, unchanged from April. An index reading above 50 means that more builders see sales conditions as good than as poor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates, which dipped near 40-year lows at the start of 2004, have risen in recent weeks as the economic rebound continues and the Federal Reserve offers stronger hints of increases to come in the benchmark short-term interest rate.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By ELSA BRENNER  </div><div>1329 words</div><div>16 May 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT may seem counterintuitive, but a recent uptick in mortgage interest rates has apparently prompted some homeowners to finally spring into action and put their homes on the market, according to Westchester sales agents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, brokers say, there are signs that a three-year drought in the inventory of houses for sale may be easing, although there are not yet any coutywide figures to confirm this. Buyers, too, are eager to clinch deals now and lock in interest rates that are still low by historical standards, they said. ''Both sides are worried that the window of opportunity may be closing,'' according to Pat Barry, an associate broker at Bronxville Ley Real Estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, by contrast, there was solid demand on the part of prospective home buyers and very attractive interest rates, but the lack of inventory put a damper on what otherwise might have been a red hot market, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the situation become part of a vicious cycle. ''Many people who were thinking of putting their houses on the market were waiting, because they were afraid they wouldn't find anything to move into,'' Mrs. Barry said. ''So the situation just got worse, not better.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, listings seem to be picking up. In Pound Ridge, Jon Posner, the president of Preferred Realty, reported that in the six weeks after April 1, 318 new listings came on the market in the northeastern Westchester real estate region that covers Armonk, North and South Salem, Pound Ridge and Somers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My impression is that's a lot more than last year, although I'm still compiling exact statistics,'' said Mr. Posner.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Pelham, rising interest rates also appeared to be prodding heretofore reluctant sellers into action, reported Mary Grimm, an owner at C. S. McClellan &amp; Company. ''It's not that we weren't busy before,'' she explained, ''but the difference now is that we finally have some properties to show. My calendar has really filled up in the last couple of weeks.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone, however, is attributing the increase in inventory to rising interest rates. ''Maybe it's the rates, and maybe it's just the usual surge that we see in the spring,'' suggested Merritt Mitchell, president of Merritt Associates, which has offices in Larchmont, Rye, Scarsdale and Greenwich. ''It's too soon to know for sure.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of Thursday, the interest rate on conventional fixed-rate 30-year mortgages was 6.38 percent, reported John E. Malesardi, senior vice president of the Hudson Valley Bank in Yonkers. By comparison, 30 days ago, the rate was 5.75 percent, and 11 months ago, in June 2003, the rate hit a low-water mark of 5.125 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester bankers and economists like David F. Seiders at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington are forecasting more interest-rate increases to come. Mr. Seiders said he expected that rates would go as high as 7.5 percent by late 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we're getting right now is a perverse positive,'' Mr. Seiders said, explaining that instead of inhibiting sales activity, the higher rates are actually spurring people into action. ''It's the fence-sitter phenomenon.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But there's a point you reach as the rates go higher and continue to do so, that you move past that temporary acceleration and experience a drag on the market,'' he added. But he noted that recent strong job numbers and positive income creation were hopeful signs that might help to counteract the eventual impact of higher rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many regions in the country, Westchester has experienced what P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, recently described as a ''longstanding problem with low inventory.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report of real estate activity for the first quarter of 2004, Mr. Mercurio explained that ''the relatively brisk pace of sales through the 2003-2004 winter did not give inventory much of a chance to rebuild.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By March 31, the county's inventory of all residences was 4,003 units, which was 8 percent fewer than at the end of the first quarter of 2003, the report said. The sharpest drop in inventory -- 34 percent -- occurred in the category of condos, which had 315 units available at the end of March, compared with 474 in the first quarter of 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SALES were up, but they could have been even higher, Mr. Mercurio said. While low inventory causes prices to rise, it also puts a brake on sales volumes. Prospective buyers ''do not purchase any property at any price,'' Mr. Mercurio said. ''Rather, when they are too limited in choice by too little stock, many will postpone their decisions.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the total of 1,925 closings of residential real estate in the county for the quarter ended March 31 -- which mostly reflects contracts signed during the last quarter of 2003 -- was the highest number for a first quarter since the record set in 1999, when the number was 2,002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of sales for single-family dwellings increased by 13 percent in the first quarter of this year, to 1,063 from 942 a year ago. For condos, the increase was also 13 percent, to 277 from 246. And for co-ops, the increase was 14 percent, to 442 from 387 during the first quarter of last year. Closings of multifamily homes rose to 143, from 120 in the first quarter a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, prices reached an all-time high. The median sales price of a single-family home for the first quarter of this year reached $574,900, which was 9 percent higher than a year earlier. It was a similar story for condominiums, which posted a median sales price of $312,450, up 13 percent from the year earlier. The median co-op price was $135,000, up 17 percent from a year earlier. And the median price for multifamily homes with two to five units reached $437,000, up by 14 percent for the period.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the median price of a single-family home was $174,100, up 7.4 percent from a year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors, a trade group based in Chicago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Locally, the real estate market is presenting a mixed picture, with a number of variables at work and uncertain outcomes, Mr. Mercurio said. Although the recent increase in interest rates may prompt some buyers and sellers to move ahead now rather than later, even small increases could immobilize Westchester's first-time home buyers, who are already struggling with the price of housing, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Single-family houses are practically out of reach for them, and the much-more-affordable condominiums and co-operatives are increasingly in short supply as a result,'' he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mercurio explained that while the middle to high end of the Westchester market can sustain itself for a time on trade-ups, in the long run the market has to be replenished with starter purchases. If mortgage interest rates deter first-time buyers, he said, overall prices could level off and even decrease in the coming months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But just how the housing market performs in the coming months is anyone's guess, said Francine Silberman, president of the Asset Center, a mortgage brokerage in Armonk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are buyers who are risk-averse and will want to lock in interest rates before they go any higher,'' she said. ''And then there are others who think the market will settle down and are willing to wait things out. It's difficult to know which of them will have the most impact on the market.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEN years ago, $1 million bought you a lot of house,'' Robert Paladino, 53, said. ''One million dollars used to be a lot of money, but now it's not.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paladino and his wife, Louann, bought a house in Harrison recently that was half the size of their old one. The new home has five bedrooms, but it sits on just one-third of an acre; they paid $1.1 million for it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the Paladinos, a growing number of Westchester home buyers are entering the million-dollar home market, whether they like it or not.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The soaring house prices in Westchester, of course, are the cause. In the early 1990's, only about 5 percent of homes in Westchester sold for $1 million or more, according to P. Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. But during the first quarter of 2004, 15.9 percent of the 1,063 single-family homes sold in Westchester went for at least $1 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There will be more and more $1 million properties as market inflation continues,'' Mr. Mercurio said, adding that Westchester housing prices ''are far above both the region and the nation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the National Association of Realtors in Washington, which charts housing sales nationwide, does not track homes that sell for more than $1 million, since ''it's fewer than 1 percent of transactions,'' said a spokesman, Walter Molony.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a few metropolitan areas, including New York, million-dollar homes are becoming commonplace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cambridge, Mass., for example, nearly 12 percent of single-family homes were valued at more than $1 million, as were 7 percent of those in San Francisco, according to data drawn from the 2000 census by Zhu Xiao Di, a research analyst at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. Although he did not examine Westchester figures, Mr. Di said that he is not surprised by the large number of million-dollar homes here.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In places where housing demand exceeds supply, and there is little open land to build more, ''one million dollars does not purchase a huge mansion, just a standard thing,'' he said. Mr. Di's study focused on owner-occupied single-family homes and thus excluded New York City's co-ops and condos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proportion of million-dollar homes, though, varies widely across municipalities in Westchester, as well as across the New York region as a whole.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bronxville, for instance, 76 percent of the single-family homes sold so far this year (a figure that includes houses and town houses but not co-ops and condos) have been for more than $1 million, according to Carolyn Martin, a broker at Bronxville-Ley Real Estate. In Rye City, 38 percent of the homes sold in 2004 went for more than $1 million, according to George M. Stone, a co-owner of Julia B. Fee Real Estate in Rye.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Greenwich, Conn., 64 percent of homes sold this year were million-plus sales, said John Cooke, the manager of Merritt Associates, a Greenwich-based realty company. In Nassau County, just 6 percent of home sales this year included those selling for more than $1 million, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disparity stems in part from the fact that housing prices have always varied widely from community to community, and what matters most is, of course, location. Also, in places like Bronxville, there are only about 1,000 homes, and very few of them are small, said Ms. Martin, who seems to know the history and provenance of nearly every dwelling in the mile-square village. Home buyers who end up paying $1 million or more for a one-, two-, or three-family house are subject to a New York State ''mansion tax,'' a 1 percent levy on the total price, which is added to the standard real estate transfer tax of $4 per $1,000. (The transfer tax a buyer would pay on a $1 million home, for example, would total $14,000; the tax on a $990,000 home, however, would be $3,960.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax was instituted in 1989 by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, according to Tom Bergin, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance in Albany.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first year the tax was collected, in fiscal year 1990-1991, 559 homes paid New York State a total of $10.4 million in mansion tax, Mr. Bergin said. By fiscal year 2002-2003, that number had multiplied 10-fold, to 5,125 homebuyers paying a total of $99.3 million, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the tax is not collected on condominium or cooperative apartments in New York City, Westchester County home buyers contribute a sizable chunk of the mansion tax revenue, about $20.9 million last year, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York State's mansion tax is the only one of its kind in the nation, according to Charles M. Staro, the chief executive of the New York State Association of Realtors, which has lobbied, unsuccessfully, for its removal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It adds to the total taxing picture of New York, which is the highest taxing state in the nation,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patty Neuwirth, the owner of Hudson Homes in Tarrytown who has sold real estate along the Hudson for nearly 25 years, said: ''The term 'mansion' needs a new definition. To me, a mansion has lots of bedrooms and lots of land, but now a house that could tip $1 million is what I bought as a starter home, just a lovely house on a street.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes showed a healthy increase in March amid job and income growth, and consumer confidence rose in April to a three-month high, according to separate reports released yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes increased 5.7 percent in March to a 6.48 million annual rate, the National Association of Realtors reported in Washington. The annual rate of existing-home sales was second only to a 6.68 million pace in September. The March purchases of previously owned homes were led by increases in the West, South and Midwest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Countrywide Financial and other lenders say that demand for mortgages grew in the first quarter, when rates on 30-year mortgages fell to the lowest average since June's record and home ownership climbed to a record.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates on 30-year mortgages averaged 5.69 percent through the first two months of the year, when most of the decisions were made on sales completed in March, down from 5.98 percent in the second half of 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York-based Conference Board's confidence index rose more than forecast, to 92.9, this month as sentiment about current economic conditions improved to the highest level in almost two years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies say they expect to increase hiring this year as an improving economy lifts sales, according to a survey by the Institute for Supply Management released yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 43 percent of all manufacturers plan to increase payrolls in the balance of the year, up from the 36 percent that said so in December, the survey indicated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected the confidence index to rise to 88.5 this month, based on the median of 61 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey, from March's previously reported reading of 88.3.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, April 26 -- Sales of new homes surged 8.9 percent in March, the Commerce Department reported on Monday. It was the largest monthly increase in nine months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase pushed sales of new single-family houses to a record seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.228 million last month, up from 1.128 million in February. The monthly rise was the highest since June 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, new-home sales soared 19.3 percent in the South, reaching a record annual pace of 613,000. But in the Northeast, sales fell sharply, down 24.3 percent to a pace of 78,000. The West posted an increase of 5.1 percent, to 349,000, and in the Midwest, sales rose 5 percent, to a pace of 188,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, said the drop in sales in the Northeast did not reflect the rising real estate market in the region. Sales were brisk the previous two months, he noted, adding that builders could not keep up with demand and that land remained scarce.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the median sales price of a new home in March dropped to $201,400, from a revised $210,000 in February.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage interest rates continued to support the strong home sales last month, with 30-year fixed-rate mortgages falling to 5.38 percent in the week ended March 18.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers are scrambling to take advantage of such low rates. Signs that the economy may be gaining momentum have pushed up bond yields, causing long-term mortgage rates also to rise. The rates on 30-year mortgages have increased for five consecutive weeks, climbing last week to the highest level this year -- an average of 5.94 percent, according to the mortgage reseller Freddie Mac.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carliner said that rising rates would probably not slow new-home sales for a couple of months. After that, he said, the job market should improve enough to keep sales strong.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors will report on sales of existing homes on Tuesday. Economists expect a slight increase.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re ''Hanging On, From Predawn to Way Past Dusk'' (news article, ''A Home Too Far'' series, April 12):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I grew up in the 1950's in Monroe County, in the heart of the Pocono Mountains. Our front door was never locked, and traffic was sparse. I spent two weeks each summer attending the Girl Scout camp you mention, which is now a large housing development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I recall two house foreclosures, and what a shocking and scandalous event each was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most moms stayed at home; mine worked part time as a maid at Mount Airy Lodge. My dad worked in a material finishing plant. We were not wealthy, but my childhood was rich with nature, close friends to play with, a great elementary education, and neighbors who all watched out for each other's kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The promise of a rural lifestyle, which the builders of Poconos housing developments use to lure buyers from New York City, has been lost by the very presence of these developments. What a pity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, April 16 -- Housing construction rebounded in March, rising by 6.4 percent, the largest increase in 10 months, the Commerce Department reported Friday. But other reports showed that production at industries fell, and consumer sentiment declined, according to the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for April, which dipped to 93.2 from 95.8 in March.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported Friday that the number of residential projects that builders started last month clocked in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of two million units, representing a 6.4 percent rise from February.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, production at factories, mines and utilities dipped 0.2 percent in March, after two months of strong increases, the Federal Reserve said. Industrial production rose 0.7 percent in January and 0.8 percent in February.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It shows what every manufacturer knows -- business is volatile, growing in spurts, not in a smooth pattern,'' said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a research group. ''The report should be seen as a temporary pause in the context of a solid industrial expansion.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing output, which had registered a 1.1 percent surge in February, was flat last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall industrial production number in March was also held down by a 2.3 percent plunge in output at gas and electric utilities, the sharpest decline in a year. That reflected a decrease in demand because of unseasonably warm weather, the Fed said. In February, output at utilities declined 0.8 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Output at mines, meanwhile, slipped 0.3 percent in March, after a 0.1 percent rise in February.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the industrial sector, hardest hit by the 2001 recession, has experienced an uneven path to recovery, the housing market has been thriving in an environment of relatively low mortgage rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advance in housing construction, the largest since last May, came after two consecutive months of declines. Bad weather, which forced construction delays in some parts of the country, was cited for those declines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March's performance was stronger than analysts were expecting. They were forecasting housing starts to rise to around 1.9 million units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent economic reports showing an increase in job creation, retail sales and consumer prices have all added to speculation in financial markets that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates in coming months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has caused long-term mortgage rates to climb. Rates on 30-year mortgages rose to 5.89 percent this week, the highest since early December. Still, economists say that home sales, which hit record highs last year, will remain healthy this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While economists have differing opinions on when the Fed may start to increase short-term rates, they do agree that it will not be at the central bank's next meeting on May 4. Economists widely expect Fed policy makers to hold short-term rates at a 45-year low of 1 percent at that time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, new residential projects under way in March rose 10.6 percent in the Midwest, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 386,000. In the South, housing construction increased 8.5 percent, to a rate of 945,000 units, and in the West, housing starts rose 3.7 percent, to a pace of 502,000. But in the Northeast, new housing projects dipped 4.9 percent, to a rate of 174,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits filed to build new housing projects -- a good measure of current demand -- rose 1.9 percent in March from February, to a rate of 1.9 million units. The rise in permits came after two consecutive months of declines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders, meanwhile, feel good about prospects for home sales in April as well as for the next six months, according to a monthly survey by the National Association of Home Builders.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Apartments Going Up, to an Average of $1 Million   </span>
</div><div class="author">By MOTOKO RICH   </div><div>1187 words</div><div>15 April 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average sales price for an apartment in most of Manhattan rose to $998,905 in the first three months of 2004, surpassing the previous record of $919,959, set in the third quarter of last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when economists and homebuyers have been wondering whether a housing bubble is on the verge of popping, the average sales price climbed to a record high, according to the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Overview, one of the most comprehensive surveys of the real estate market below 96th Street on the East Side and below 112th Street on the West Side.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Miller Samuel, the appraisal firm that prepared the Elliman report, the median price -- the exact middle of all apartment sales -- in Manhattan during the first quarter was $625,000. But even that was a record, up 21 percent from the same period a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures from the Corcoran Group, one of the largest real estate brokers in Manhattan, showed that average prices breached the psychological barrier of $1 million in the first quarter of this year, rising 32 percent, to $1,001,000, from $760,000 in the same period last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high averages posted last quarter have all been skewed by high-priced sales as more people have bought bigger and more expensive apartments than at the same time last year. Many of the price increases were driven by bidding wars and buyers offering well over asking prices. According to Corcoran, the number of deals that closed over the asking price was 57 percent in the first quarter, up from just 23 percent in the same period last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dottie Herman, president of Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate, said the increase was simply a case of supply and demand. ''There really is no supply,'' she said. Indeed, according to the firm's market overview, inventories of available apartments for sale continued to fall in the first quarter to 4,299 apartments, down 32 percent from 6,349 a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fourth quarter of last year, prices dipped slightly, to $903,259. That was in comparison to a third-quarter figure that had been inflated by the record-setting $45 million sale of a penthouse at the Time Warner Center. The increase in prices in the first quarter of this year has delighted brokers, but also discouraged buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Herman said that the lack of available apartments had incited bidding wars, and that she believed the market was now even more frenzied than during the hot market of 1999 and 2000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such numbers have meant sticker shock for a lot of buyers. Ann McIndoo, a 50-year-old speechwriter for authors who is trying to move to Manhattan from Orange County, California, thought that with $1 million, she would be able to find a spacious two-bedroom apartment here.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when she started seeing what her money could buy in Manhattan, she was stunned, and began raising her offering price from $1 million, gradually hitting $1.8 million. She also scaled back the list of demands she gave her broker: ''When I first gave him my list, I said, 'I want two bedrooms, lots of light, closets, a window in the kitchen.' But when I started looking at things, I found that just isn't available here. Or you need three or four million to do it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Billitzer, the Douglas Elliman broker who is working with Ms. McIndoo, said: ''For people that have been in their homes for some time, $1.5 million is a lot of money. You can't just tell them 'no, you've got to increase your budget by 30 to 40 percent.''' He said he had several clients who had given up on buying for now and were renting instead.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crazy state of the market, though, makes some buyers wonder whether they will see a repeat of the late 1980's and early 1990's, when prices hit record highs and then plunged. With so much home buying driven by historically low mortgage rates, economists are watching for the impact of a probable rise in interest rates as early as this summer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The biggest danger to the market is that rates will go up,'' said Karl E. Case, a professor of economics at Wellesley College and a partner in Fiserv CSW, a real estate research firm. Still, he said, most people regarded real estate as a better investment than stocks or bonds, a factor that would likely keep prices from collapsing altogether.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, said rising interest rates would at first prompt even more people to enter the market. ''When people start to see interest rates picking up, they're going to try even harder to get in before they go even higher,'' she said. ''It's like a battle cry.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if prices do come down, said Hall F. Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens, a real estate brokerage firm in Manhattan, housing will remain a good investment. ''The only people in my entire career that I've ever seen lose money are those that by circumstance buy in a high market and then they are forced by circumstance to sell at a low,'' he said. ''Barring that, if you look over time, even where there are dips in values, the value of real estate over time continues to go up.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bidding wars have become a particular problem, said Chuck Sage, a broker with Douglas Elliman, because buyers were having trouble securing mortgages when bankers appraised the apartments for less than the purchase price. ''If somebody is buying something for several thousand dollars more than what the apartment is actually worth, then the buyer may not get the amount of money that you need to finance the apartment,'' Mr. Sage said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite such worrying trends, Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, said he did not believe the market was approaching the troubled waters of the early 1990's. The difference, he said, was that in the late 1980's, a boom in co-op conversions and condo development flooded the market with supply for which there was no demand. This time around, supply is in check and low interest rates are keeping demand high.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is not much comfort for the buyers who are struggling to find an apartment. Ms. McIndoo, the relocating speechwriter, said she would keep looking. But, she said, ''I'll probably have to spend more money.''   </p>

</div><div class="author">By EDWIN McDOWELL   </div><div>2389 words</div><div>11 April 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2004 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on April 11 about mortgages misstated the amount of interest on home loans that can be deducted on federal taxes. The $1 million maximum applies to the mortgage loan itself, not to the amount paid in interest on the loan. CORRECTED 4/25/04. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS home prices have floated upward in the last decade, the dollar threshold for what are called jumbo mortgages has also risen, from $133,250 in 1986 to $333,700 this year. Such mortgages can carry a slightly higher interest rate than what are called conforming loans, those that meet the criteria for purchase by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite the increases in the threshold, the percentage of mortgages in the jumbo category, though it has declined in recent years, remains about what it was a decade ago, at 6.52 percent of all home loans in 2003, compared with 6.37 percent in 1993.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world of jumbo mortgages -- and of ''super jumbos,'' home loans that start at $650,000 and can go up to $10 million or more -- is a large one. The top five originators of jumbo mortgages issued loans worth almost $340 billion in 2003, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a newsletter for executives in the residential mortgage business. <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Home Mortgage</span> accounted for $93.4 billion; <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span> was second with $84.8 billion; <span class="companylink">Chase Home Finance</span> was third with $65.38 billion; <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span> was just behind, with $65 billion; and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> was fifth with $30.69 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newsletter also estimates that in 2003 there was a total of $660 billion in jumbo loans, out of $3.76 trillion for the mortgage market as a whole. (A trillion is 1,000 billion.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most borrowers have fixed-rate mortgages, individuals who take out jumbo loans are much more likely to get adjustable-rate mortgages, in which the rates can change over time, depending on benchmark loan rates. And the financial requirements of the banks extending jumbo loans can rise with the size of the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One attraction that applies to holders of both jumbo and conforming loans, however, perhaps especially at this time of year, is deductibility: interest payments are deductible from federal taxes, up to a limit of $1 million a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an era of intense demand for high-end properties in some markets, stratospheric numbers are not as rare as they used to be. Six days ago, Dr. Stephen B. Colvin, the chief of cardiovascular surgery at New York University Medical School, and his wife, Helane, closed on a $2,535,000 loan from the New York Mortgage Company in Manhattan to refinance their condominium on East End Avenue at the corner of 82nd Street and gain funds to complete an extensive renovation. The 2,600-square-foot apartment has three bedrooms, three baths, a large eat-in kitchen, floors made of marble and rare woods and an assortment of other exceptional details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they bought the condominium about two years ago, Dr. Colvin said, the appraisal price was roughly $1.9 million and their mortgage from the <span class="companylink">Bank of New York</span> was $1.5 million. But when the Colvins decided to undertake what the doctor described as ''a massive construction project,'' they contacted New York Mortgage and received a second-mortgage ''bridge loan'' of $500,000 to begin the renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking to consolidate the loans and pay all the renovation costs, Dr. Colvin turned again to New York Mortgage. The company asked for two new appraisals. One put the value of the property at $3.9 million, the other at $4.2 million. New York Mortgage ended up lending $2,535,000. ''So we locked into an adjustable rate mortgage that started at about 3.7 percent for 10 years, but would never go above 10.5 percent,'' Dr. Colvin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, the details of loans at this level may be different from those for jumbo mortgages that are just above the ceiling of conventional mortgages. According to Neil Bader, the branch manager of Wells Fargo Private Mortgage Bank responsible for the New York area, ''Jumbo loans over $333,700 don't necessarily require a larger down payment,'' than smaller loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loans below $333,700 are usually underwritten to conform to the standards of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the Congressionally chartered companies that purchase loans from banks and other originators, then package them with others and sell them to investors on what is called the secondary market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conforming loan limit used by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, explained David Broderer, a financial analyst with the Federal Housing Finance Board, which helps oversee the nation's mortgage system, is derived from an annual survey of actual house prices. These surveys, taken in October and released in November, chart the average home price associated with newly issued mortgages, which is compared with the average home price the previous October. The percentage change is calculated and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> are responsible for using that percentage change to calculate the new conforming loan limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR mortgages conforming to the <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> standards, the down payment requirement is usually a minimum of 20 percent of the price of the home, and this standard often applies for loans in the low end of the jumbo category. ''But as the loan amount increases,'' Mr. Bader said, so could the percentage down payment requirements. ''At $500,000 it would ordinarily not require a larger down payment, but at $900,000 it might,'' Mr. Bader said. ''It varies from financial institution to institution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another difference, Mr. Bader noted, can be in the requirements for a borrower's monthly cash flow. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s standards ordinarily require that after closing the mortgage, the borrowers have enough for two months of ''PITI'' payments -- meaning principal, interest, taxes and insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As loans soar past the jumbo threshold, the guidelines can be significantly more rigorous. For example, a home mortgage over $1 million could require post-closing liquidity -- meaning cash and investments that can easily be sold-- of more than 50 percent of the borrower's annual income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for the continuing demand for jumbo mortgages in the New York City area is that housing prices continue to soar. ''House prices are so insane,'' said James C. Maloney, who together with his brother Christopher originates mortgage loans for <span class="companylink">J. P. Morgan Chase</span> in Melville, N.Y. Last year the brothers originated about 120 jumbos, sometimes, he said, for surprising amounts. ''For example,'' Mr. Maloney said, ''I sold clients a $3.2 million mortgage in the Hamptons, to buy a property valued at $5.6 million, and they're going to demolish and spend $1.5 million on construction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Super jumbos are concentrated where there are lots of people with lots of money. New York City and the Hamptons are obvious strongholds. In other parts of the country, San Francisco and nearby Marin County, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago and Boston are markets with many super jumbo loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many super jumbo borrowers are obviously very well off, high net worth does not necessarily mean corresponding cash flow. ''Some people take larger loans,'' said Steven Schnall, the president and chief executive of the New York Mortgage Company, ''because they don't have sufficient liquidity to pay all cash.'' Or sometimes, he added, they might have appreciated assets that they don't want to liquidate because they would have to pay capital gains tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bader said that the rates on fixed-rate jumbo mortgages are often slightly higher than the prevailing rate for conventional mortgages -- usually a quarter to one-half of one percent higher. This is a consequence of the more limited secondary market for such loans, unlike the easily securitized conforming loans bought, combined with others and then sold to investors by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> do not, by definition, purchase jumbo loans from their originators, they do purchase a small number of adjustable-rate loans, known as ARM's. Such loans often have the same rate whether they are jumbos or conforming loans. That depends on market conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard J. Russell, a mortgage broker and the president of Richland Equity Resources in Manhattan, said, ''I always insist that the consumer taking out a loan of $400,000 or more be sure to choose an ARM.'' Those products, he added, are available with a wide spectrum of conditions: mortgages whose rate is adjustable monthly, at one extreme, or ARM's with an initial rate frozen for three, five, seven or 10 years. Such loans are typically amortized over 30 years, and once the initial period stops, the consumer may want to convert to a fixed rate loan or keep the adjustable if the rates are favorable at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on the pattern that a high proportion of people who take out jumbo loans opt for adjustable-rate rather than fixed-rate mortgages, Douglas Duncan, the chief economist of <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, pointed to the balance of risk and reward -- and the ability of people with greater assets to take greater risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The larger the loan at any given interest rate, the larger the payment,'' he said. ''ARM interest rates are typically lower than fixed interest rates.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People in the jumbo market tend to have more wealth and typically more income,'' Mr. Duncan said, ''therefore they can afford to take the risk that their monthly payment will rise if interest rates rise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harry Tomlinson, a senior vice president of <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>, said that people who borrow in the jumbo range tend to have significant assets, so they often are quite sophisticated about financial matters. ''Because of that, they tend to understand how low rates are now,'' he said. ''They can recognize that the difference between fixed rate mortgages and an adjustable can be two to three percentage points and over the course of the year could save them significant interest payments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schnall of the New York Mortgage Company said that 65 percent of its jumbos are ARM's, but they are not for everyone, especially those with incomes that would keep them out of the jumbo market. If someone making $50,000 to $75,000 a year takes out a mortgage that is adjustable and it goes up significantly over time, he said, ''that lower income borrower might not be able to afford the higher payment.'' He added, ''For that borrower, the fixed-rate mortgage provides a lot of security.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he pointed out, the borrower of a super jumbo might be spending a lower percentage of his or her income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Mr. Schnall said, ''the average borrower with an income of $75,000 a year, which amounts to $6,250 a month, spends roughly 30 percent of that. And if you make $2 million a year, you're probably not spending the same 30 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you were to borrow $600,000 over 30 years at 4 percent, your monthly payment would be $2,864.'' He added, ''With taxes, insurance and other home expenses, your monthly payment would be $3,564.'' To qualify to carry $3,564 in monthly housing expenses, the borrower would need to demonstrate earnings of approximately $129,600, less than a person who earns $2 million annually makes in a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some people are borrowing more money than they may have believed possible -- and beyond what it is prudent for them to borrow -- according to Keith Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage publisher based in Pompton Plains, N.J. ''Those larger loan amounts may be the result of easier underwriting standards,'' he said. ''So because of market conditions, they may leverage themselves beyond what may have been typical in years past.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PART of the explanation is the historically low levels of interest rates. In <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s Primary Market Survey for the week ended last Thursday, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.79 percent, with an average fee -- called ''points'' -- of 0.7 percent, up significantly from the previous week, when a mortgage averaged 5.52 percent. Last year at this time, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.85 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the same period, the average for the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was 5.12 percent, with an average 0.7 point, up from 4.84 percent the previous week. A year ago at this time, the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.17 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amy Crews Cutts, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s deputy chief economist, said in a statement Thursday that the rise in mortgage rates was related to changes in the bond market. ''The bond market reacted to the welcome news last Friday that jobs are finally being created, which is much needed for continued expansion of the economy,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added that the increase spurred speculation that the Federal Reserve Board would raise rates sooner rather than later. ''With that said,'' she went on, ''it should also be noted that long-term rates are not expected to rise precipitously and, in fact, we still expect the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage will average below 6 percent for 2004.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRIDGEWATER -- WHEN Andrew McElroy ventured once again into the frantic, caffeinated, buy-buy-buy real estate market here recently, he wasn't quite sure what to expect. But shortly after he put his town house on the market, he found out just how hyperactive sales here can be. In his case, ''shortly'' turned out to be 24 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We put it on the market on a Monday, and we had 13 or 14 people who wanted to see it,'' recalled Mr. McElroy, 29. ''Tuesday, we had offers. It took one day, basically.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of pace did not come as a complete surprise to him: Two years ago, when he and his wife, Michele, bought the town house, it happened the same way -- a contract was signed within a single day of the property entering the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been crazy for a few years now,'' Mr. McElroy said. ''But I never expected to see it continue like this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only has the fevered market continued, real estate agents and other experts say it is getting more intense. Across the New York metropolitan region, high demand, limited supply and mortgage rates that sit at almost historically low levels have combined to drive the suburban real estate market. Price tags have jumped even in places like 43,000-person Bridgewater, which has long enjoyed a reputation for affordable home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the most recent census, home values in Bridgewater increased by about a fifth from 1990 to 2000, about double the median rate of increase in the state. But now, agents and others here estimate that the prices for some homes in this part of Somerset County are increasing by about a third each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding wars and multiple offers are just an accepted part of doing business here. One-day listings are not at all uncommon. And while the appreciation of home values is a boon to sellers, sociologists and other planning experts say that middle-class buyers who have traditionally looked toward communities like Bridgewater for housing in their price range often find themselves unable to buy. Average family income in the corridor between Far Hills and Bridgewater rose by half in the 1990's. In a reflection of the new wealth, real estate values grew even faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is still on fire, burning more fiercely than ever. ''You can't keep them on the market,'' said Bruce Gartner, an agent with <span class="companylink">Weichert Realtors</span> in nearby Bedminster, who helped the McElroys sell their home. ''Unless your client's willing to go out there the day it comes on the market. You kind of sound like a used car salesman when you say that to them. But then they lose one or two and say, 'Oh, that's the way it is.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things are the way they are partly because of a dearth of available housing in this part of New Jersey and the demand generated by more than half a dozen major corporations, like <span class="companylink">Johnson &amp; Johnson</span>, <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> and Verizon, that have big operations in Somerset County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add Bridgewater's proximity to both I-287 and I-78 and the allure of the area comes into clearer focus. According to the Census Bureau, this central New Jersey county is the state's fastest growing -- its population increased by roughly a quarter to nearly 300,000 during the 1990's. And according to that same data, the area around Bridgewater experienced the county's greatest percentage increases in home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both trends seem to have accelerated since the 2000 census. And prices haven't just jumped here in Somerset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market is exploding,'' said Esther Einstein, an agent with Coldwell Banker based in Flemington in the heart of Hunterdon County, New Jersey's wealthiest county. ''Right now, people are surprised if their homes don't sell in a week.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those increased expectations have forced a tactical shift among many buyers. ''You come to them saying, 'How much over list do you want to go?''' Mr. Gartner said, describing how he advises customers to place initial offers above a home's listed asking price. ''You know it's going to sell over list, so just put your best foot forward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gartner, who has worked in the area for the last half a decade, sighed when asked about the intensity and competitiveness of the market. ''This seems to be about the worst we've had it,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Forgotten Middle Class</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sociologists and economists say soaring real estate prices mean it simply costs more for a middle-class family to stay in the middle. Some experts see a widening gulf in the middle of the middle class, separating those who have and those who have more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey there are great extremes of wealth and poverty, and then, somewhere in the middle, is a middle class whose definition is at best slippery. Nationally, if a family's annual income is $75,000, by most definitions the family belongs to the middle class. By that standard a low six-figure income would put a New Jersey family in the upper middle class nationally -- yet that family may well not be in a position to buy a house in most of New Jersey's communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More and more it's a case of winners and losers in the middle class,'' said Susan S. Fainstein, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University. ''There are two groups. If you have a secure and steady job, own a home, you can be doing quite well. Then there are all those people who are on a slippery slope who are afraid that they're going to lose their job or that it will go off to India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're the ones who are the forgotten middle class,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Fainstein said that those most affected by skyrocketing home values in the region are first-time buyers and the young.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The people for whom it's really hard are people just entering the housing market, young couples, people without a nest egg or without parents who can help them,'' she said. ''They're the middle class that's downwardly mobile, because even if you have a decent income, who has $60,000 in the bank for a down payment when they just got out of college or graduate school or wherever?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current tightening of the real estate market in the New York metropolitan region is simple supply and demand. Because there is little affordable housing being built, whatever existing quality housing stock remains is sometimes fought over by prospective buyers with dueling bids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which serves to price large segments of the middle class out of some real estate markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know how people are doing it,'' said Rachel Ranis, a sociology professor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn. ''It's very hard for any family to buy in this market unless both parties are working.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time it has become harder for many to enter the housing market, those who do make it want even more once they get there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People's expectations have gotten higher,'' she said. ''Before, we were happy to have just one car in a household. Now, everyone has to have a car. If you buy a house, everyone has to have a room. People have changed a lot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has remained largely constant, Professor Ranis said, are the forces that drive homebuyers into the suburbs around the region: the quest for bigger yards, better schools and perhaps a slower, more measured pace of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Ranis noted that another factor appears to be playing a larger role: worry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One thing we find is that you're worried that you will be able to duplicate what you've always considered middle class,'' she said. ''The key value is how to keep yourself where you are and your children, how to give them the best start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of pressure on people to keep up with what they're accustomed to. It's no longer about keeping up with the neighbor next door, it's their own wants and what they're accustomed to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the status-conscious suburbs, a larger home is still the No.1 symbol of success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The ones who are doing well, you see people going out and getting bigger and bigger houses,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''You look at some of these homes that have closets the size of my bedroom when I grew up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the reason size matters?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the symbol of your achievement, the symbol of your status,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''It puts a premium on those homes with the center hall and the chandelier and all this space where you can demonstrate your lifestyle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While practically no one would prefer that a community be poorer rather than richer, some experts wonder about the effects of such changes on the character of established middle-class communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of the suburbs that have maintained quality housing have become more and more exclusive,'' Dr. Fainstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More exclusive perhaps, but also, say some, communities in high-priced markets grow less diverse and its residents less connected socially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has a huge impact of community connectedness,'' said Robert Fisher, the director of urban and community studies at the University of Connecticut's West Hartford campus. ''The issue of social connectedness, a lot of that has to do with destabilization. While bringing affluence into these communities, a lot of people are pushed out as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to mention, Dr. Fisher said, those who because of high prices never get to enter some communities in the first place. ''What's happening is that the American dream is a little bit less within the reach of a lot of people,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Old Crossroads</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dutch and Scottish settlers came to this part of Somerset County in 1749. ''The early Dutch were attracted by the rivers,'' Jim Kurzenberger, president of the Somerset County Historical Society, said of the Raritan, the Millstone and a handful of tributaries that run through the county. ''With Holland being below sea level, they were accustomed to farming in low marsh areas. So they stayed in an area where they could practice their traditional agriculture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As virtually everywhere else during the era, the agrarian economy dominated, but Somerset, like many surrounding counties, has also been a way to get from here to there. The Old York Road between Philadelphia and New York City passed through Somerset, and he the Camden &amp; Amboy railroad arrived in the 1840's, followed by the Somerville-Raritan Valley line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mid-19th century also saw the rise of grain mills and brickyards in the area, which flourished into the 1900's when residents of the area witnessed major transportation upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You see a lot of infrastructure improvements, a lot of road improvements,'' he said. ''People like to think that a lot of that happened only with the interstates, but it was happening back then.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Somerset was still sparsely populated and heavily rural, Mr. Kurzenberger said, until the end of World War II.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That was the biggest change,'' he said. ''You saw the return of veterans, you starting seeing the subdivisions, but those subdivisions would be considered tame by our standards.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next wave of major development here was spurred by the landmark Mt. Laurel decisions by the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1975 and 1983, which found that suburban communities had to provide their share of affordable housing in the region by relaxing zoning restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What followed was a state apparatus that set numerical goals for the amount of affordable housing in certain areas. Developers also used the decisions to leverage communities into allowing them to build higher-density developments, threatening to file suit against municipalities -- citing the decisions -- if zoning rules were not relaxed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Bridgewater was definitely affected by it, re-evaluating their zoning,'' Mr. Kurzenberger said. ''Everyone saw the writing on the wall.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, Mr. Kurzenberger said, the changes in the county and in Bridgewater have been dramatic. According to the Census Bureau, Somerset County is the fastest growing county in the nation's most densely populated state. The county's population rose by nearly a quarter during the 90's from about 240,000 people to more than 297,000. The increases in Bridgewater mirrored that trend. Although census figures show that the township's population grew by only about 3,000 people during the 1980's -- from about 29,000 to roughly 32,000 -- an average of 1,000 new residents moved into the 33-square-mile township each year during the 90's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too Many Bulldozers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although virtually every community in the county has drafted some kind of plan to improve road capacity, traffic flow and otherwise improve Somerset's infrastructure, many longtime county residents here say that the construction and congestion can be wearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I moved into Hillsborough 30 years ago,'' said Hubert Mertes, 62, an antique seller in Somerville. ''The day I moved in, they put a shovel in the ground and they haven't stopped since.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mertes said the traffic has gotten so bad in his neighborhood that where he once could back out of his driveway and head off to work, he often has to wait for a long line of cars lined up at a stoplight to pass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just too many cars and not enough road,'' Mr. Mertes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mertes said that one measure of the once-rural county's development could be seen in two plots of land near his home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was mostly farms,'' Mr. Mertes said. ''There were two big sheep farms in my neighborhood when I moved in. One of the sheep farms is now a housing development; the other is a shopping mall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My son, he moved out of the area, he won't come back down because he said it's sad what's happened.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other longtime county residents, however, have welcomed the changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're thriving,'' said Charyl Greenberg, a lifelong Somerville resident and a co-worker of Mr. Mertes. ''Downtown U.S.A. had to reinvent itself. And compared to a lot of other towns we're thriving.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of that growth has been spurred by the emergence of several major employers in the area. Bridgewater alone is home to a handful of major companies like <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span>, <span class="companylink">Ethicon</span>, <span class="companylink">Aventis</span> and <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span>, and Somerset County is base for about two dozen other companies with more than 500 employees apiece, according to John P. Maddocks, vice president for economic development of the Somerset County Business Partnership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Maddocks said that among the first companies to arrive in the area were <span class="companylink">Johnson &amp; Johnson</span> and <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span>, which -- just like other property buyers who settled here -- were drawn by the wide-open spaces that could still be found here in the 1970's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you left New York City and looked west, there were limited areas where you could go,'' Mr. Maddocks said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Somerset offered acres of office space land at prices attractive to companies looking for a place to put large office, research or manufacturing sites. The influx of employees filling those sites, and their families, have also filled the school district that serves Bridgewater. Since 1990, according to district figures, the student body has increased by more than half, from 5,179 to 8,704.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those increases mean that the district will soon be involved in no fewer than eight building projects, including the construction of a new elementary school and new gymnasiums and wings at other schools to accommodate the additional students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not easy, that's for sure,'' Walter Mahler, superintendent of the Bridgewater-Raritan Regional School District, said of the enrollment increases. From a budget standpoint, he said, ''we have to curtail everything we can aside from construction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Mahler said that next year alone the high school figures to have about 170 new students. ''You do the math,'' he said. ''Think about the courses a child needs, how many hours a teacher can teach. We estimate we're going to have to hire 11 more teachers this year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The esteem in which parents hold the district is both a compliment and a challenge for Dr. Mahler and other officials, who welcome the praise of parents of new students while trying to figure out where they're going to put them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the district's growth looks to continue for at least the next several years, Dr. Mahler said. Students have been coming to the district is such great numbers that school officials have started adjusting the enrollment projections every six months. The latest projection indicates that the district's population will edge toward 10,000 students within the next four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And those projections,'' Dr. Mahler said, ''they've been right on the money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too Few Houses</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money is, of course, key to the home-buying madness that currently reigns here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, some agents said, the spike in prices that has driven prices up for the past few years in the area have accelerated even in the past few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Terebey Jr., a seller with ReMax of New Jersey based in Princeton, said that in the past few weeks alone prices have increased anywhere from 3 percent to 5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Spring came in like a lion,'' Mr. Terebey said. ''Entry-level pricing is nonexistent in the Somerset, greater Mercer County area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes that were being offered for $125,000 two years ago are now selling for $200,000 and more. In this market, entry level has risen to the $300,000 range, and few houses are available at that price. Mr. Terebey recently labeled one Internet listing for a ranch in Hillsborough with the heading: ''Great home in a hard to find price range!'' It was being offered for $319,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such shifts, Mr. Terebey said, have been frustrating for even the most optimistic shoppers. ''Most of our buyers are just numb,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those with the temerity to buy often find themselves making tough choices, like deciding to buy outside of the area where they originally wanted to even if that means tacking on precious minutes to the daily commute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The farther east you go, the less you get for your dollar,'' said Cindy Czaskos, a Weichert seller based in Clinton. ''A lot of people, they're looking to go the extra miles to get more with their dollar.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, Ms. Czaskos said, an additional 15 minutes of commuting time could mean a savings in the tens of thousands of dollars on a home's price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She, too, noted home prices that have increased exponentially over the past five years or so, with properties sometimes tripling in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been even crazier the last few years,'' she said. ''Some of us just look at each other'' she said of her fellow real estate agents, ''and shake our heads.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was just about the reaction Andrew McElroy and his wife had when they first entered the market here a few years ago. And they leave it now, with the addition of their 8-month-old daughter, feeling much the same way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the sale of their home in Bridgewater is made final, the McElroys plan to move to Sussex County, at the northern tip of the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked why they didn't choose to remain near their current home or somewhere else in Somerset County, Mr. McElroy answered without hesitation. ''The prices,'' he said. ''They're a little bit more than I wanted to pay.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROSLYN HEIGHTS -- KIRIL TZOTCHEV has a problem: figuring out how to live among the wealthy, even though he isn't really one of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To hear Mr. Tzotchev tell it, he is just about the furthest one can be from rich: he is an artist. But those who buy his work tend to be in a higher tax bracket. So when it came time to shop for a home, he kept in mind the old adage and followed the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My art, the wealthy people can afford it,'' said Mr. Tzotchev, 42, a naturalized citizen who came to the United States from his native Bulgaria more than a dozen years ago. ''I want to be around the rich people,'' he said with a chuckle that indicated he was only half joking. ''As an artist, I have to be here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he focused his house hunt on the area around tiny Roslyn Heights, a place close to some of the most affluent communities on Long Island, yet known as a potential trove for middle-income bargain hunters. Still, the prices for places he liked were a bit outside sculptor range. So he decided to wait out the market. That was two years ago. He's still waiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The price,'' Mr. Tzotchev said, ''it keeps going up and up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up is the operative word for home values everywhere in the New York metropolitan area, particularly with mortgage rates so low as to be virtually unprecedented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those factors have combined to increase price tags even in places like 6,300-person Roslyn Heights, which was once seen as a refuge for those with mid-level incomes but upper-crust aspirations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to sales figures for Roslyn Heights compiled by the Multiple Listing Service, the sales database shared by real estate agents, buyers need more than twice as much money as they did just two years ago to get a foot on the bottom rung of the market. The lowest sale price for a house in the hamlet has risen from $135,000 in 2000 to $322,000 today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multiple offers on many properties are a given. Bidding wars are not uncommon. And sociologists and other planning experts say that a byproduct of these escalating pricetags is that very often the middle class, who for decades formed the core of communities like Roslyn Heights, find themselves priced out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents say it isn't hard to figure out what's driving values here so high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Lack of product. Period,'' said Linda Wohl, a vice president with Daniel Gale Associates and manager of the real estate brokerage's Roslyn office. ''The school district is excellent. The community is desirable because of that. There's the accessibility. We have more buyers than we have houses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Multiple Listing Service statistics for Roslyn Heights, the average sale price of a home has nearly doubled in the last four years, from $429,463 in 2000 to $848,926 today. That's a sharp acceleration from the 1990's, when home values in Roslyn Heights grew about 16 percent, according to census figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market has changed,'' said Ms. Wohl, who has sold real estate in the Roslyn area for nearly three decades. ''The market is a little bit of a slow roller coaster. This is a seller's market. Still, I remember when interest rates were 17 percent and we still sold houses. Now, we have more buyers. There are multiple offers. The numbers are incredible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that is a sentiment shared by both agents and prospective buyers alike. ''I don't know where people get the money to afford it,'' Mr. Tzotchev said. ''If you don't inherit, I don't know where you get it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downwardly Mobile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sociologists and economists say soaring real estate prices mean it simply costs more for a middle-class family to stay in the middle. Some experts see a widening gulf in the middle of the middle class, separating those who have and those who have more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island there are great extremes of wealth and poverty, and then, somewhere in the middle, is a middle class whose definition is at best slippery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, if a family's annual income is $75,000, by most definitions the family belongs to the middle class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By that standard a low six-figure income would put a Long Island family in the upper middle class nationally -- yet that family may well not be a position to buy a house in most of the Island's communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More and more it's a case of winners and losers in the middle class,'' said Susan S. Fainstein, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University. ''There are two groups. If you have a secure and steady job, own a home, you can be doing quite well. Then there are all those people who are on a slippery slope who are afraid that they're going to lose their job or that it will go off to India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're the ones who are the forgotten middle class,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Fainstein said that those most affected by skyrocketing home values in the region are first-time buyers and the young.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The people for whom it's really hard are people just entering the housing market, young couples, people without a nest egg or without parents who can help them,'' she said. ''They're the middle class that's downwardly mobile, because even if you have a decent income, who has $60,000 in the bank for a down payment when they just got out of college or graduate school or wherever?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current tightening of the real estate market in the New York metropolitan region is simple supply and demand. Because there is little affordable housing being built, whatever existing quality housing stock remains is sometimes fought over by prospective buyers with dueling bids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which serves to price large segments of the middle class out of some real estate markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know how people are doing it,'' said Rachel Ranis, a sociology professor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn. ''It's very hard for any family to buy in this market unless both parties are working.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time it has become harder for many to enter the housing market, those who do make it want even more once they get there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People's expectations have gotten higher,'' she said. ''Before, we were happy to have just one car in a household. Now, everyone has to have a car. If you buy a house, everyone has to have a room. People have changed a lot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has remained largely constant, Professor Ranis said, are the forces that drive homebuyers into the suburbs around the region: the quest for bigger yards, better schools and perhaps a slower, more measured pace of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Ranis noted that another factor appears to be playing a larger role: worry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One thing we find is that you're worried that you will be able to duplicate what you've always considered middle-class,'' she said. ''The key value is how to keep yourself where you are and your children, how to give them the best start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of pressure on people to keep up with what they're accustomed to,'' she said. ''It's no longer about keeping up with the neighbor next door, it's their own wants and what they're accustomed to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the status-conscious suburbs, a larger home is still the No. 1 symbol of success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The ones who are doing well, you see people going out and getting bigger and bigger houses,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''You look at some of these homes that have closets the size of my bedroom when I grew up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the reason size matters?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the symbol of your achievement, the symbol of your status,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''It puts a premium on those homes with the center hall and the chandelier and all this space where you can demonstrate your lifestyle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While practically no one would prefer that a community be poorer rather than richer, some experts wonder about the effects of such changes on the character of established middle-class communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of the suburbs that have maintained quality housing have become more and more exclusive,'' Dr. Fainstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More exclusive perhaps, but also, say some, communities in high-priced markets grow less diverse and its residents less connected socially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has a huge impact of community connectedness,'' said Robert Fisher, the director of urban and community studies at the University of Connecticut's West Hartford campus. ''The issue of social connectedness, a lot of that has to do with destabilization. While bringing affluence into these communities, a lot of people are pushed out as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to mention, Dr. Fisher said, those who because of high prices never get to enter some communities in the first place. ''What's happening is that the American dream is a little bit less within the reach of a lot of people,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaped by Transportation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, Roslyn Heights has been a fairly typical Long Island bedroom community. But its roots go deeper than those of most Nassau or Suffolk locales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Present-day Nassau County was part of the Dutch New Netherlands colony, but Myrna Sloam, the archivist at the Bryant Public Library in Roslyn, said the first Old World settlers in the Roslyn area were the English, who crossed Long Island Sound from Connecticut and set up quarters at the head of Hempstead Harbor in 1643 as a first step toward establishing what is now Hempstead about eight miles south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The settlement became Roslyn, and Roslyn Heights is one of a cluster of communities around it, also including Roslyn Estates, Roslyn Harbor, East Hills and Flower Hill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like countless other towns on the Island, early life in the Roslyns revolved around the water -- fishing and clamming -- but even from its beginnings, life here was a little bit different, Ms. Sloam said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was almost an industrial village,'' she said. ''There was farming on the outskirts, but there was a grist mill going back to the 1700's. There was a paper mill and other parts of a little industrial, craftsman community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most significant event in the area's early history was when the <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span> came to the Roslyn area in 1864. ''That made it easier for people to get out here,'' Ms. Sloam said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also made it easier for residents to make their way into the city. Before the rails came, the preferred method of transportation into Manhattan was by steamboat. Estimated travel time? About 3 hours. ''And that was the fast way,'' Ms. Sloam said. ''The roads could take 6 or 7 hours if it rained.'' (Insert your own Long Island Expressway joke here.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the area entered the 20th century, the mills faded, the steamboats disappeared and Roslyn Heights began to grow up around the train station. By the 1930's the five main villages that make up the Roslyns were in the middle of an uptick in home construction that would herald the population boom across the Island after World War II.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''None of the other industries carried on in any other way,'' Ms. Sloam said. ''It just became a suburban community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, in some areas, a decidedly upscale suburban community at that. But in a sea of affluence, Roslyn Heights had reputation as place where middle-class buyers could find bargains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Traditionally, the Heights was more affordable,'' Ms. Sloam. ''But from what I'm hearing the prices have gone up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making things more difficult for homebuyers here is the growth in home prices in surrounding communities. Two census tracts within seven miles of Roslyn Heights -- including communities like Old Westbury and Brookville -- notched the highest percentage increases in home values on Long Island from 1990 to 2000, according to census figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spike in home prices here over the past few years came after a decade during which census figures show Roslyn Heights actually lost population. In the 90's, the population of the Heights dipped about 2 percent. Its black population fell from 9 percent to 6 percent, while the number of Asians (5 percent in 1990) and Hispanics (4 percent in 1990) grew to 10 percent and 7 percent, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The community's growth has also been reflected in its schools, which agents say buyers frequently cite as a key draw. More than half of the children of Roslyn Heights attend the Roslyn Union Free School District; the rest are in the Mineola district. Barry Edelson, the district's director of community relations, said that over the past decade and half the student population has grown by more than third, from 2,400 in 1990 to roughly 3,300 today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've grown a lot in the last 10 to 12 years,'' said Mr. Edelson, but not because many new homes had been built. Rather, he said, ''it's been strictly demographic -- we're going from a town of people without children or whose children are not in school to younger families.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, fully 40 percent of taxpayers in the district have school-aged children, Mr. Edelson said, an increase of about 15 percent from a low several years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the area's school system, another attraction for potential buyers is the area's proximity to New York City. Located about 20 miles east of midtown Manhattan and convenient to Northern Boulevard, the Northern State Parkway and the Long Island Expressway, the Roslyns are enticing for weary commuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People always talk to me in terms of access and accessibility,'' said Renee Hughes, an agent with Daniel Gale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when it comes to price tags? Ms. Hughes says she rarely sees customers who lapse into slack-jawed sticker shock anymore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's about 50-50,'' she said. ''Some do. But most people already know what they're getting into.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Seller's Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During an open house here last Sunday, Yami Dotan, a Century 21 agent in the Roslyn Heights area for a dozen years, frowned as she described a couple who had recently made an offer on a home that they coveted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They made a low offer,'' Ms. Dotan said. ''I say to everyone, 'Give your best offer, as close as you can to the asking price,' because owners here will get the asking price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dotan said she knows a handful of sellers who have increased their asking price after noticing what was happening in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's amazing,'' she said. ''I remember days I would have a listing and I would open the door for an open house and the listing would expire and not go sold. I would get so frustrated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within 40 minutes of the Sunday open house, four families had visited. The asking price for the rather ordinary-looking, gray four-bedroom Colonial built just after World War II: $729,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective buyers have learned that such prices are just about par for the course here in Roslyn Heights, a pleasant though unremarkable community where much of the housing stock is postwar Colonials and split-levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sarah Pak was one of those visiting the open house. She said she had scoffed at the idea of paying in the upper six figures for a home in the area last year, much to her chagrin. In just the past year, real estate sales figures show, the average price for a home here has jumped about $150,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The demand is very high,'' said Ms. Pak, 37, who visited the gray Colonial with her husband, Yoon, 38, and their children, Curtis, 7, and Joseph 3. ''I'm not surprised. We were looking last year. The prices have gone up since then.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pak said that she and her husband are concerned about letting another year pass without buying something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now, I realize,'' she said, ''this is the time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Paks' story is familiar to Ms. Dotan. ''I had a customer two years ago, his friends told him, 'Don't buy, wait, the market's too high, it's going to crash,''' she said. ''Now he can't afford it because he has the same budget and the prices have gone up and up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Ms. Dotan's prospective buyer balked in 2002, the average price here has increased by more than a quarter million dollars, according to sales figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every time you think it's the top,'' Ms. Dotan said of home prices here. ''And then it goes up again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of what's driving the increases in home values here is what agents said was a spike in renovations and what are commonly known as ''knockdowns'' -- homes that have been purchased with the intent of being razed so that a new, more luxurious property can be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After leaving the gray Colonial, Ms. Dotan headed toward one property in the Country Club section of Roslyn Heights that was bought in the last five years or so for about a half-million dollars. The original home had been rebuilt and reborn as a majestic four-bedroom Colonial with a maple and granite gourmet kitchen and a walk-in closet upstairs about the size of a freight elevator. The owner was selling, asking $1.5 million.Ms. Dotan said it wasn't far-fetched for the owner to try to command that kind of asking price. In fact, she said, he was one of the customers who raised his initial price after watching the market boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had to raise the price here,'' Ms. Dotan said. ''He saw what's going on around here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people involved in construction and real estate on Long Island wonder whether the market for such opulent homes can be sustained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think anything over a million dollars and higher has plateaued,'' said Muzzio Tallini, a builder with Signature Homes in Elmont. ''I think people who spend that kind of money want value and they're going to start asking, 'Who are you to be charging that kind of dough?'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A visitor to the Country Club Colonial, Mike Youdim, was looking for a home in the Roslyn Heights area so that he and his wife, Sharona, can be closer to his parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These prices are whew,'' he said, shaking his head as he made his way through the master bedroom upstairs. ''It's ridiculous.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Youdim told Ms. Dotan that about four years ago he was looking for a home in the area and found that didn't want to pay for anything in the what-now-seems-pretty-reasonable half-million dollar range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were hoping the prices were going to steady,'' Mr. Youdim said. ''But every year you wait, it goes up another 15 or 20 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Location, Location</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kiril Tzotchev knows from those kinds of increases. Even after more than two years of looking for a home in the Roslyns, he still struggles to fathom how the market is able to sustain itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, he and his wife, Irina, are renting a modest place in Greenvale, about three miles northeast of Roslyn Heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're just trying to make a living,'' said Mr. Tzotchev, who also rents an artist's studio down in Sea Cliff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while Mr. Tzotchev dreams of home ownership, he fears that at the current rate he won't be able to afford anything he likes unless he hits the big time. And he wonders if even that will help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very expensive even if you are famous artist,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not too long ago, he came upon a house that looked great on the outside and had a decent price tag: $400,000. Once inside, he realized that there was a catch: it had only one bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Four hundred thousand dollars,'' he said, disbelief dripping from every syllable. ''For one bedroom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In hindsight, he wishes that someone had warned him away from the area before he fell in love with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I emigrated, I didn't even know where I was going,'' he said. '''Nobody said, 'This is the place to be for artists.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he found that for him it was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tzotchev is able to make a decent living between sales in a good year, he may sell a piece every month or so and teaching art courses at the Nassau County Museum of Art. Indeed, he's so spoiled by the area's charms and its well-heeled art buyers that he seems determined to stick the market out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I like the quietness of the area,'' Mr. Tzotchev said. ''As an artist I want to be not disturbed. That's why I'd like to be in a quiet area amongst the birds.'' He paused, then added with a laugh: ''Amongst the rich people and the birds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photos: For Kiril Tzotchev, living and working near the affluent North Shore buyers of his sculpture is a business necessity.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRIDGEWATER -- WHEN Andrew McElroy ventured once again into the frantic, caffeinated, buy-buy-buy real estate market here recently, he wasn't quite sure what to expect. But shortly after he put his town house on the market, he found out just how hyperactive sales here can be. In his case, ''shortly'' turned out to be 24 hours.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We put it on the market on a Monday, and we had 13 or 14 people who wanted to see it,'' recalled Mr. McElroy, 29. ''Tuesday, we had offers. It took one day, basically.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of pace did not come as a complete surprise to him: Two years ago, when he and his wife, Michele, bought the town house, it happened the same way -- a contract was signed within a single day of the property entering the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been crazy for a few years now,'' Mr. McElroy said. ''But I never expected to see it continue like this.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only has the fevered market continued, real estate agents and other experts say it is getting more intense. Across the New York metropolitan region, high demand, limited supply and mortgage rates that sit at almost historically low levels have combined to drive the suburban real estate market. Price tags have jumped even in places like 43,000-person Bridgewater, which has long enjoyed a reputation for affordable home prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the most recent census, home values in Bridgewater increased by about a fifth from 1990 to 2000, about double the median rate of increase in the state. But now, agents and others here estimate that the prices for some homes in this part of Somerset County are increasing by about a third each year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding wars and multiple offers are just an accepted part of doing business here. One-day listings are not at all uncommon. And while the appreciation of home values is a boon to sellers, sociologists and other planning experts say that middle-class buyers who have traditionally looked toward communities like Bridgewater for housing in their price range often find themselves unable to buy. Average family income in the corridor between Far Hills and Bridgewater rose by half in the 1990's. In a reflection of the new wealth, real estate values grew even faster.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is still on fire, burning more fiercely than ever. ''You can't keep them on the market,'' said Bruce Gartner, an agent with Weichert Realtors in nearby Bedminster, who helped the McElroys sell their home. ''Unless your client's willing to go out there the day it comes on the market. You kind of sound like a used car salesman when you say that to them. But then they lose one or two and say, 'Oh, that's the way it is.'''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things are the way they are partly because of a dearth of available housing in this part of New Jersey and the demand generated by more than half a dozen major corporations, like Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer and Verizon, that have big operations in Somerset County.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add Bridgewater's proximity to both I-287 and I-78 and the allure of the area comes into clearer focus. According to the Census Bureau, this central New Jersey county is the state's fastest growing -- its population increased by roughly a quarter to nearly 300,000 during the 1990's. And according to that same data, the area around Bridgewater experienced the county's greatest percentage increases in home values.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both trends seem to have accelerated since the 2000 census. And prices haven't just jumped here in Somerset.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market is exploding,'' said Esther Einstein, an agent with Coldwell Banker based in Flemington in the heart of Hunterdon County, New Jersey's wealthiest county. ''Right now, people are surprised if their homes don't sell in a week.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those increased expectations have forced a tactical shift among many buyers. ''You come to them saying, 'How much over list do you want to go?''' Mr. Gartner said, describing how he advises customers to place initial offers above a home's listed asking price. ''You know it's going to sell over list, so just put your best foot forward.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gartner, who has worked in the area for the last half a decade, sighed when asked about the intensity and competitiveness of the market. ''This seems to be about the worst we've had it,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Forgotten Middle Class  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sociologists and economists say soaring real estate prices mean it simply costs more for a middle-class family to stay in the middle. Some experts see a widening gulf in the middle of the middle class, separating those who have and those who have more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey there are great extremes of wealth and poverty, and then, somewhere in the middle, is a middle class whose definition is at best slippery. Nationally, if a family's annual income is $75,000, by most definitions the family belongs to the middle class. By that standard a low six-figure income would put a New Jersey family in the upper middle class nationally -- yet that family may well not be in a position to buy a house in most of New Jersey's communities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More and more it's a case of winners and losers in the middle class,'' said Susan S. Fainstein, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University. ''There are two groups. If you have a secure and steady job, own a home, you can be doing quite well. Then there are all those people who are on a slippery slope who are afraid that they're going to lose their job or that it will go off to India.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're the ones who are the forgotten middle class,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Fainstein said that those most affected by skyrocketing home values in the region are first-time buyers and the young.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The people for whom it's really hard are people just entering the housing market, young couples, people without a nest egg or without parents who can help them,'' she said. ''They're the middle class that's downwardly mobile, because even if you have a decent income, who has $60,000 in the bank for a down payment when they just got out of college or graduate school or wherever?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current tightening of the real estate market in the New York metropolitan region is simple supply and demand. Because there is little affordable housing being built, whatever existing quality housing stock remains is sometimes fought over by prospective buyers with dueling bids.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which serves to price large segments of the middle class out of some real estate markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know how people are doing it,'' said Rachel Ranis, a sociology professor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn. ''It's very hard for any family to buy in this market unless both parties are working.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time it has become harder for many to enter the housing market, those who do make it want even more once they get there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People's expectations have gotten higher,'' she said. ''Before, we were happy to have just one car in a household. Now, everyone has to have a car. If you buy a house, everyone has to have a room. People have changed a lot.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has remained largely constant, Professor Ranis said, are the forces that drive homebuyers into the suburbs around the region: the quest for bigger yards, better schools and perhaps a slower, more measured pace of living.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Ranis noted that another factor appears to be playing a larger role: worry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One thing we find is that you're worried that you will be able to duplicate what you've always considered middle class,'' she said. ''The key value is how to keep yourself where you are and your children, how to give them the best start.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of pressure on people to keep up with what they're accustomed to. It's no longer about keeping up with the neighbor next door, it's their own wants and what they're accustomed to.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the status-conscious suburbs, a larger home is still the No.1 symbol of success.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The ones who are doing well, you see people going out and getting bigger and bigger houses,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''You look at some of these homes that have closets the size of my bedroom when I grew up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the reason size matters?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the symbol of your achievement, the symbol of your status,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''It puts a premium on those homes with the center hall and the chandelier and all this space where you can demonstrate your lifestyle.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While practically no one would prefer that a community be poorer rather than richer, some experts wonder about the effects of such changes on the character of established middle-class communities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of the suburbs that have maintained quality housing have become more and more exclusive,'' Dr. Fainstein said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More exclusive perhaps, but also, say some, communities in high-priced markets grow less diverse and its residents less connected socially.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has a huge impact of community connectedness,'' said Robert Fisher, the director of urban and community studies at the University of Connecticut's West Hartford campus. ''The issue of social connectedness, a lot of that has to do with destabilization. While bringing affluence into these communities, a lot of people are pushed out as well.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to mention, Dr. Fisher said, those who because of high prices never get to enter some communities in the first place. ''What's happening is that the American dream is a little bit less within the reach of a lot of people,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Old Crossroads  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dutch and Scottish settlers came to this part of Somerset County in 1749. ''The early Dutch were attracted by the rivers,'' Jim Kurzenberger, president of the Somerset County Historical Society, said of the Raritan, the Millstone and a handful of tributaries that run through the county. ''With Holland being below sea level, they were accustomed to farming in low marsh areas. So they stayed in an area where they could practice their traditional agriculture.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As virtually everywhere else during the era, the agrarian economy dominated, but Somerset, like many surrounding counties, has also been a way to get from here to there. The Old York Road between Philadelphia and New York City passed through Somerset, and he the Camden &amp; Amboy railroad arrived in the 1840's, followed by the Somerville-Raritan Valley line.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mid-19th century also saw the rise of grain mills and brickyards in the area, which flourished into the 1900's when residents of the area witnessed major transportation upgrades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You see a lot of infrastructure improvements, a lot of road improvements,'' he said. ''People like to think that a lot of that happened only with the interstates, but it was happening back then.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Somerset was still sparsely populated and heavily rural, Mr. Kurzenberger said, until the end of World War II.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That was the biggest change,'' he said. ''You saw the return of veterans, you starting seeing the subdivisions, but those subdivisions would be considered tame by our standards.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next wave of major development here was spurred by the landmark Mt. Laurel decisions by the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1975 and 1983, which found that suburban communities had to provide their share of affordable housing in the region by relaxing zoning restrictions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What followed was a state apparatus that set numerical goals for the amount of affordable housing in certain areas. Developers also used the decisions to leverage communities into allowing them to build higher-density developments, threatening to file suit against municipalities -- citing the decisions -- if zoning rules were not relaxed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Bridgewater was definitely affected by it, re-evaluating their zoning,'' Mr. Kurzenberger said. ''Everyone saw the writing on the wall.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, Mr. Kurzenberger said, the changes in the county and in Bridgewater have been dramatic. According to the Census Bureau, Somerset County is the fastest growing county in the nation's most densely populated state. The county's population rose by nearly a quarter during the 90's from about 240,000 people to more than 297,000. The increases in Bridgewater mirrored that trend. Although census figures show that the township's population grew by only about 3,000 people during the 1980's -- from about 29,000 to roughly 32,000 -- an average of 1,000 new residents moved into the 33-square-mile township each year during the 90's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too Many Bulldozers  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although virtually every community in the county has drafted some kind of plan to improve road capacity, traffic flow and otherwise improve Somerset's infrastructure, many longtime county residents here say that the construction and congestion can be wearing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I moved into Hillsborough 30 years ago,'' said Hubert Mertes, 62, an antique seller in Somerville. ''The day I moved in, they put a shovel in the ground and they haven't stopped since.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mertes said the traffic has gotten so bad in his neighborhood that where he once could back out of his driveway and head off to work, he often has to wait for a long line of cars lined up at a stoplight to pass.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just too many cars and not enough road,'' Mr. Mertes said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mertes said that one measure of the once-rural county's development could be seen in two plots of land near his home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was mostly farms,'' Mr. Mertes said. ''There were two big sheep farms in my neighborhood when I moved in. One of the sheep farms is now a housing development; the other is a shopping mall.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My son, he moved out of the area, he won't come back down because he said it's sad what's happened.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other longtime county residents, however, have welcomed the changes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're thriving,'' said Charyl Greenberg, a lifelong Somerville resident and a co-worker of Mr. Mertes. ''Downtown U.S.A. had to reinvent itself. And compared to a lot of other towns we're thriving.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of that growth has been spurred by the emergence of several major employers in the area. Bridgewater alone is home to a handful of major companies like AT&amp;T, Ethicon, Aventis and Pfizer, and Somerset County is base for about two dozen other companies with more than 500 employees apiece, according to John P. Maddocks, vice president for economic development of the Somerset County Business Partnership.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Maddocks said that among the first companies to arrive in the area were Johnson &amp; Johnson and AT&amp;T, which -- just like other property buyers who settled here -- were drawn by the wide-open spaces that could still be found here in the 1970's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you left New York City and looked west, there were limited areas where you could go,'' Mr. Maddocks said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Somerset offered acres of office space land at prices attractive to companies looking for a place to put large office, research or manufacturing sites. The influx of employees filling those sites, and their families, have also filled the school district that serves Bridgewater. Since 1990, according to district figures, the student body has increased by more than half, from 5,179 to 8,704.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those increases mean that the district will soon be involved in no fewer than eight building projects, including the construction of a new elementary school and new gymnasiums and wings at other schools to accommodate the additional students.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not easy, that's for sure,'' Walter Mahler, superintendent of the Bridgewater-Raritan Regional School District, said of the enrollment increases. From a budget standpoint, he said, ''we have to curtail everything we can aside from construction.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Mahler said that next year alone the high school figures to have about 170 new students. ''You do the math,'' he said. ''Think about the courses a child needs, how many hours a teacher can teach. We estimate we're going to have to hire 11 more teachers this year.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The esteem in which parents hold the district is both a compliment and a challenge for Dr. Mahler and other officials, who welcome the praise of parents of new students while trying to figure out where they're going to put them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the district's growth looks to continue for at least the next several years, Dr. Mahler said. Students have been coming to the district is such great numbers that school officials have started adjusting the enrollment projections every six months. The latest projection indicates that the district's population will edge toward 10,000 students within the next four years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And those projections,'' Dr. Mahler said, ''they've been right on the money.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too Few Houses  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money is, of course, key to the home-buying madness that currently reigns here.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, some agents said, the spike in prices that has driven prices up for the past few years in the area have accelerated even in the past few weeks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Terebey Jr., a seller with ReMax of New Jersey based in Princeton, said that in the past few weeks alone prices have increased anywhere from 3 percent to 5 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Spring came in like a lion,'' Mr. Terebey said. ''Entry-level pricing is nonexistent in the Somerset, greater Mercer County area.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes that were being offered for $125,000 two years ago are now selling for $200,000 and more. In this market, entry level has risen to the $300,000 range, and few houses are available at that price. Mr. Terebey recently labeled one Internet listing for a ranch in Hillsborough with the heading: ''Great home in a hard to find price range!'' It was being offered for $319,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such shifts, Mr. Terebey said, have been frustrating for even the most optimistic shoppers. ''Most of our buyers are just numb,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those with the temerity to buy often find themselves making tough choices, like deciding to buy outside of the area where they originally wanted to even if that means tacking on precious minutes to the daily commute.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The farther east you go, the less you get for your dollar,'' said Cindy Czaskos, a Weichert seller based in Clinton. ''A lot of people, they're looking to go the extra miles to get more with their dollar.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, Ms. Czaskos said, an additional 15 minutes of commuting time could mean a savings in the tens of thousands of dollars on a home's price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She, too, noted home prices that have increased exponentially over the past five years or so, with properties sometimes tripling in value.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been even crazier the last few years,'' she said. ''Some of us just look at each other'' she said of her fellow real estate agents, ''and shake our heads.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was just about the reaction Andrew McElroy and his wife had when they first entered the market here a few years ago. And they leave it now, with the addition of their 8-month-old daughter, feeling much the same way.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the sale of their home in Bridgewater is made final, the McElroys plan to move to Sussex County, at the northern tip of the state.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked why they didn't choose to remain near their current home or somewhere else in Somerset County, Mr. McElroy answered without hesitation. ''The prices,'' he said. ''They're a little bit more than I wanted to pay.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WITH apartment prices rising across Manhattan, Vivian Ducat, a documentary filmmaker and creator of multimedia Web presentations, found the home of her dreams on the top floor of the Riviera, an aging but opulent building on Riverside Drive at West 157th Street, built in 1910 on a site where John James Audubon had an estate in the early 19th century.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the windows of her newly refinished oak-paneled dining room, Ms. Ducat can look out at the Empire State Building, and then she can wander down a long parquet hallway to her bedroom and watch the sun set behind the George Washington Bridge. The price was $650,000 for 1,600 square feet of space, including a butler's pantry and a maid's room. Only a decade ago this was a jarringly high sum for most Manhattan apartments, but today it is a fraction of what a similar apartment would cost farther downtown.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when the average two-bedroom apartment in the rest of Manhattan is selling for more than $1 million, price-numbed refugees like Ms. Ducat have been making the trek uptown to Harlem, Hamilton Heights, Washington Heights and Inwood, places once off the map of many brokers and buyers, to find more space at a lower cost, driving up prices of co-ops and condominiums there, too.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new study of a decade of apartment sales illustrates this trend. It found that prices in the parts of Manhattan dense with co-ops and condominiums -- below 96th Street on the East Side and 116th Street on the West Side -- have more than doubled from 1993, when the city was emerging from a real estate downturn, through 2003, with average prices rising from $444,000 to $1.06 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the last four years, the study showed, the rate of the rise in these traditional Manhattan co-op and condo neighborhoods has slowed, while uptown prices have soared as more and more buyers, once deterred by abandonment, crime and longer commuting times have looked northward. Sales north of 96th Street on the East Side and 116th Street on the West Side, which currently account for 4 percent of apartment sales in Manhattan, are at their highest prices on record, though far below prices in other neighborhoods.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market survey, by Jonathan Miller of the Miller Samuel appraisal firm, found that since 2000, when the economy and the stock market hit a peak, co-op and condominium prices per square foot in northern Manhattan have risen 63 percent, while prices elsewhere in Manhattan -- which started from higher dollar figures -- have risen by an average of 26 percent. Prices below 14th Street have risen by 33 percent, followed by 28 percent on the West Side and 19 percent on the East Side.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said that while demand for multimillion-dollar luxury apartments has picked up in the last few months, demand for more moderately priced condos and co-ops has been strong for most of the last few years. Powering the rise in prices was a combination of low interest rates, increasing demand and a smaller inventory of apartments for sale, as many long-term renters decided to buy -- with increasing numbers of buyers venturing northward in search of affordable apartments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has been a surge in activity at the entry level, and it continued to 2003,'' Mr. Miller said. ''We saw improvements despite a weak economy, and this was largely fueled by historically low interest rates.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also documents a 7.5 percent decline last year in the number of sales across Manhattan, as fewer owners put their apartments up for sale. The limited supply of apartments helped push up prices, but brokers and economists disagree on the cause. Economists say the low inventory is a sign of a weakness in the economy. Brokers say the market is so strong that owners are afraid to put their apartments on the market until they have already found a new property to buy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rae D. Rosen, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that a sluggish job market has meant fewer people moving in and out of New York, and therefore a lower supply of apartments for sale. ''Prices get bid up anyway,'' she said, ''because the city remains such a magnet and a place that people want to be.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven James, a senior executive vice president at Douglas Elliman, who supervises 300 brokers, said the shrinking inventory of apartment listings had contributed to the price rise and a return of a frenzy of bidding wars this winter ''every week, sometimes daily.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He described two one-bedroom apartments in postwar buildings -- one in Union Square, one in the West 70's -- offered for more than $600,000, with each attracting six or seven bids. ''Isn't it sad,'' he said, ''that a one-bedroom at $625,000 is the low end.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern Migration  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driven Uptown By Price Pressure  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is just such price pressure that has driven many buyers who want to stay in Manhattan to look farther and farther uptown.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout the 1990's there has a gradually awakening of interest in uptown Manhattan, as middle-class buyers rediscovered brownstone neighborhoods in Harlem, taking chances on areas that were often perceived as too close to the edge of crime, drug trafficking and decay. For much of this period co-op and condominium prices remained flat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over the last four years, brokers say, prices across upper Manhattan began rising in co-ops and condominiums too, as first a wave of people in the arts -- artists, musicians, theater people -- moved in, followed by a more eclectic and increasingly affluent mix of accountants, architects, schoolteachers and business people.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many had been renting for years farther downtown, saving up their down payment on an apartment. Without equity in an existing condo or co-op to sell, some buyers do not have enough cash to enter the regular Manhattan apartment game, brokers say. Last year, two-bedroom apartments in upper Manhattan averaged $340,000, but brokers say prices have continued to rise this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Jordan, a corporate recruiter, and his partner, Daniel Chisholm, a French teacher at the Collegiate School, spent a year looking to move from their rented studio on West End Avenue in the 70's. They wanted quiet and light and a real kitchen, ''not a Bunsen burner in a closet,'' Mr. Jordan said. These were nonnegotiable, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the West Side, they found they could afford two tiny rooms, with windows facing walls. Then, Mr. Chisholm went apartment hunting for a friend who was moving back to New York City and discovered Washington Heights.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He found a neighborhood, identified by brokers and neighborhood groups as Hudson Heights, a sliver of land that rises up along the Hudson, west of Broadway, between J. Hood Wright Park at 173rd Street and Fort Tryon Park, that was spared much of the decay that eroded many neighborhoods in the 1960's and 1970's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now they are preparing to close on a four-room co-op in a 1930's Art Deco building on Pinehurst Avenue and West 187th Street. They have a separate dining room, a sunken living room and a shared rooftop deck. The price is $310,000 with maintenance of $566 a month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were taken with the neighborliness of the streets, the new restaurants that had opened in the last few years and Frank's Gourmet Market, which while ''not Zabar's'' had enough exotic cheeses and other delicacies to make them feel they were not leaving Manhattan for the wilderness.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The more we went to the neighborhood, the more we liked it,'' Mr. Jordan said. ''The apartments were pretty big, there was less noise and people seemed less hurried and stressed. People say hello to each other on the street.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Neighborhoods  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renewal Comes In Different Styles  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upper Manhattan includes a mix of different neighborhoods with different demographics, histories, housing stock and styles of condominium and co-op apartments. In Harlem and Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood to the west of Harlem, there are a mix of older co-ops and newer condos and co-ops in renovated or new buildings, as the neighborhood goes through a period of renewal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the new buildings were built with government subsidies or on low-cost land, through the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, and include a mix of market rate and subsidized apartments for sale. For the subsidized units there are income limits, typically $104,000 a year for a family of four, though most buyers to date have had far lower incomes, housing officials say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the next few years hundreds of additional co-ops and condominiums will be completed, in buildings from 119th Street in East Harlem to Frederick Douglass Boulevard in Central Harlem to Bradhurst Avenue and 145th Street, according to Susan Ponce de Leon, a director of program operations for the department.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Miller's market study, which includes sales of apartments with income restrictions, prices averaged $340,000 last year for two-bedroom apartments in Harlem.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Rosa Parks, a new six-story red-brick building, with penthouses, set to open this spring at 163 St. Nicholas Avenue at West 118th Street, all 64 condominiums sold out quickly, according to Natasha Sinkov, a broker at Douglas Elliman, even in the face of several price increases. She said contracts had been signed for market-rate two-bedroom apartments for as much as $440,000, while a three-bedroom penthouse duplex with a 1,200-square-foot private terrace went to contract at $670,000. Prices in some of the building's units were kept lower to keep them affordable, under an agreement between the developer and the city, which provided land for the project.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farther north, Broadway has always been the dividing line, with high-quality housing built for the upper middle classes to the west near the river and the more utilitarian middle-class and working-class housing to the east, according to Andrew S. Dolkart, an associate professor at Columbia University who teaches and writes about architectural history and preservation in Manhattan. The co-op and condo markets are centered on the west side of Broadway.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Joel Levin and his wife, Tara Collins, were still unpacking boxes in their ground-floor apartment in a four-story building at Hudson View Gardens, with a view across to the Palisades out of a rear bedroom window. Their building faces a garden and stone retaining wall, on a perpetually quiet landscaped private street.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They paid $361,000 for a 1,100-square-foot two-bedroom apartment with a remodeled kitchen and a Sub-Zero refrigerator and were just getting to know their new neighborhood. Hudson View Gardens is a development with 453 apartments in 15 Tudor-style buildings at Pinehurst Avenue and West 183rd Street. It opened in 1924, as one of the first co-op developments in Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Levin, the location was ideal. He teaches and runs the computer lab at the Fieldston School in Riverdale. She is a lawyer at Legal Aid Society with an office in Lower Manhattan, at the other end of the island. They wanted to stay in Manhattan to avoid what they feared would have been a two-hour commute for one or the other if they had moved to Brooklyn or Riverdale.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had been paying $1,433 for a rent-stabilized 750-square-foot apartment on West 110th Street near Broadway, the rent low enough to allow them to begin accumulating a down payment. ''For years people were telling us the real estate market was going to drop, but we were watching and waiting for eight years,'' Mr. Levin said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by the time they started looking, it was too late for the Upper West Side. So they found a new neighborhood, Hudson Heights, that felt like a quiet Brooklyn neighborhood, but hard by the city. Mr. Levin said there are no washing machines or dryers allowed in apartments, and until the electricity is upgraded, they are permitted to use only low-power air-conditioners.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One 900-square-foot apartment at Hudson View Gardens tracked by Mr. Miller, sold for $50,000 in 1994 and then doubled in price to $118,000 four years later. Last spring, it sold again for $330,000, a sixfold increase in a decade.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simone Yen Song, a broker in Washington Heights since the mid-1980's, watched co-op prices drop in the early 90's and then witnessed the rebound over the last five years. She said many Manhattanites were scared off by their fears of longer commutes and the perception that Washington Heights is a dangerous place.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when Washington Heights had a reputation as a regional drug center, she said, the neighborhood remained stable, never abandoned by the middle class and working people who lived there. ''There are perceptions that were never true,'' she said. ''Washington Heights is 50 blocks. This immediate neighborhood has never been close to the drugs. People thought this neighborhood was too far away, until they got on the subway and realized it is 20 minutes to Midtown.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just across the street from Mr. Levin's home and closer to the river is Castle Village, which opened in 1938 with 579 apartments in a series of 14-story towers set on open lawns with a promenade overlooking the river. Another large co-op development, Park Terrace Gardens, is in Inwood near Inwood Hill Park and the northern tip of Manhattan. Built before World War II, it has 400 hilltop apartments in five buildings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone moving northward is a first-time home buyer. Ms. Song told of one buyer, a C.P.A. and investor, and his wife, who paid $630,000 a few years ago for a 2,300-square-foot double apartment in Castle Village with sweeping views of the Hudson and then spent several hundred thousand dollars renovating it, far more than the couple had expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But unlike many other purchasers moving northward, they were downsizing. They had just sold a 4,000-square-foot loft in Astor Place, where they had lived for 20 years, for $2 million, and they were searching for a smaller place that was still large enough to hang their art collection.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living closer to the George Washington Bridge makes the trip to their golf club in New Jersey more convenient, and they were still only 20 minutes from Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory Dwindles  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'We Don't Have Much Product'  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in the rest of Manhattan, the supply of apartments on the market in upper Manhattan dwindled last year -- but far more steeply, falling 25 percent, according to Mr. Miller's analysis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gus Perry, the principal broker of Stein-Perry Real Estate in Washington Heights, attributed this to a spike in prices in 2002, which brought out a rush of sellers trying to take advantage of the higher prices. Now, ''We don't have much product,'' he said. ''Anything that comes on the market in a nice building is basically name your price.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uptown living does have some inconveniences. In some neighborhoods there are few services and residents are forced to do most of their shopping elsewhere. There are still shells of buildings and vacant lots in some neighborhoods, standing as silent reminders of a troubled past. Crime and open drug sales have sharply declined as they have across the city, but the police are still under pressure in many communities to do more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the quality of many local schools lagging, many new residents send their children to private schools and public schools outside the neighborhood. But brokers say, discerning parents can find some higher quality schools or parent-supported alternative programs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Public School 187 on Cabrini Boulevard is a highly regarded traditional K-8 school. In Inwood, the Muscota New School, an alternative program at P.S. 176 has attracted interest, while the Hamilton Heights Academy is a small parent-founded alternative program in P.S. 28 on West 155th Street now in its second year. Groups of parents are working on other new schools and programs as well.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The perils and promises of the uptown co-op market are evident along upper Riverside Drive, where Ms. Ducat now lives with her husband, Ray Segal, a documentary film producer, and two sons on the 12th floor of an ornate 1910 building with a vast marble lobby and 202 apartments that follows a curve along Riverside Drive from West 156th Street to West 157th Street.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ducat grew up on West 72nd Street near Riverside Drive and after some stints in Boston and abroad, returned to live in the 80's on the West Side. But for a decade she yearned for more space in classic old New York apartment building, just across from where she now lives. It was 1992, a time when the New York co-op market was in the doldrums. Ms. Ducat saw an ad in The Westsider, a neighborhood weekly for an apartment in the Grinnell, an eight-story building topped by corner towers at 800 Riverside Drive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a 10-room apartment available, with high ceilings, and butler's and maid's rooms. But her husband said no. He had lived years before on the Lower East Side and knew, he said, what it was like to live in a bad neighborhood. She thought of that apartment often over the years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last May, Ms. Ducat, an executive editor at Columbia University Digital Knowledge Ventures, a group in the university that develops Internet-based courses and presentations, idly typed the name ''Grinnell'' into Google and rekindled a passion and a quest that led to the purchase of her apartment across the street.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her new apartment had been renovated by Michael Laudati, a movie makeup artist who frequently works with Harrison Ford. In his spare time, Mr. Laudati buys and restores historic properties in authentic styles. He said he worked on Ms. Ducat's apartment over the course of more than a year, stripping, rebuilding and refinishing cabinets, doors and woodwork and matching period lighting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the years that Ms. Ducat pined after a grand old apartment, the neighborhood of her dreams had gone through some extraordinary transformations as well. Jude Dayani, a broker with Orsid Realty who lives in the Riviera said that the entire building had been purchased for about $1 million in 1980 and converted to a co-op in 1985, in the midst of the conversion frenzy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Values rose and fell and rose again. One six-room apartment on the eighth floor tracked by Mr. Miller sold for $149,000 in 1987 and then sold again in 1993 at foreclosure for $23,000. But earlier this year it was sold a third time for $520,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only apartment now on the market is a one-bedroom unit on the 11th floor with an asking price of $465,000, Ms. Dayani said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In light of the rising prices, it seems possible that many once elegant rental buildings along Riverside Drive could be candidates for conversions to condominiums in the future.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Ms. Ducat has a stack of articles and books about the history and architecture of her chosen neighborhood in a prominent place in her built-in bookcases. In her dining room, she now has space to display possessions long locked away in cabinets: a colorful fruit bowl, a sculpture brought back from her travels in Zimbabwe years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is a volunteer with a group, Uptown Treasures, that promotes cultural institutions from Hamilton Heights to Inwood, though, she said, she never thought of doing anything like that while living on the West Side. She has come to believe that her new neighborhood, with its mix of cultures and languages, is more authentically New York, than her old neighborhood on the West Side is today.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now,'' she said, ''Broadway in the West 80's might as well be suburban, with Coach leather, Godiva chocolate and Victoria's Secret.'' Her new neighborhood, she said, ''reminds me of the Upper West Side of the 1960's.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SO many new construction projects have been started in East Lyme, so many zoning variances granted, so much discussion of clearing this and building that, that to Bob Gadbois the term ''planning board'' has been rendered almost an oxymoron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gadbois, who has spent virtually all of his 63 years in what is still a cozy New England town of 18,000, is concerned about the lingering effects of 15 years of intense development that has seen the town's population increase by better than a fifth, lengthening traffic delays, burdening sewer lines and heralding the arrival of decidedly uncozy businesses like the Super Stop&amp;Shop grocery store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But perhaps what puzzles Mr. Gadbois most about the changes in his community is the math that officials use to measure them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You go to these planning meetings and they say, 'Don't worry, this will only bring 1.2 more cars.' I ask them 'What's a point-2 car?''' Mr. Gadbois said. ''The same with kids. They talk about 2.5 children. What's point-5 children? I haven't seen half a kid yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What he has seen in his community, though, is more cars, more families, more children, more taxes, and especially more wealth. According to the Census Bureau, the 30-square-mile census tract that includes East Lyme and a cluster of other communities has witnessed the greatest percentage increase in family income from 1990 to 2000 in all of Connecticut. Figures show that the average family income nearly tripled in that decade, and economic experts say there is every reason to believe that the trend has accelerated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The texture of the town is in flux as well. Experts say the flood of new money may be squeezing those in the middle and working classes who have traditionally been a large segment of former farming and fishing towns like East Lyme. For longtime residents of such communities, it can be difficult not to feel alienated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people say: 'Oh, you live in East Lyme? It's a ritzy town,''' said Mr. Gadbois's wife, Mary. ''Well, there are some of us here that aren't so ritzy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resentment of the change may have been evidenced here last year when Democrats running on an anti-sprawl platform were the top vote getters for the town's planning commission and made other key gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The makeover is not limited to East Lyme. Just down the road a bit in New London, a sliver of a neighborhood wedged between Connecticut College and the United States Coast Guard Academy saw the state's greatest percentage increase in home values in the last census. Housing experts and real estate agents say communities in a roughly 20-mile radius around East Lyme, including Norwich in the north to Stonington on the Rhode Island border, have some of the largest increases in home values in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's becoming very difficult for people with income less than $300,000 to actually stay in a lot of the communities they've been in,'' said Candace Howes, an associate professor of economics at Connecticut College. ''You've got these old fishing villages that have become the hot new place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emergence of the nearby Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods casinos and a major expansion of the <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> plant in New London have further driven the already outsize demand for quality housing in surrounding areas, including East Lyme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going crazy,'' said Pat Pastor, a manager with William Raveis Real Estate &amp; Homes Services, who said that she had seldom seen anything like the current trend in 30 years of selling homes in the market. ''There was a lull in the business in the early 90's, and then we got the casinos.'' And the lull, Mr. Pastor said, was no more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Two Middle Classes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sociologists and economists say soaring real estate prices mean it simply costs more for a middle-class family to stay in the middle. Some experts see a widening gulf in the middle of the middle class, separating those who have and those who have more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More and more it's a case of winners and losers in the middle class,'' said Susan S. Fainstein, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University. ''There are two groups. If you have a secure and steady job, own a home, you can be doing quite well. Then there are all those people who are on a slippery slope who are afraid that they're going to lose their job or that it will go off to India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're the ones who are the forgotten middle class,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Fainstein said that those most affected by skyrocketing home values in the region are first-time buyers and the young.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The people for whom it's really hard are people just entering the housing market, young couples, people without a nest egg or without parents who can help them,'' she said. ''They're the middle class that's downwardly mobile, because even if you have a decent income, who has $60,000 in the bank for a down payment when they just got out of college or graduate school or wherever?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current tightening of the real estate market in the New York metropolitan region is simple supply and demand. Because there is little affordable housing being built, whatever existing quality housing stock remains is sometimes fought over by prospective buyers with dueling bids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which serves to price large segments of the middle class out of some real estate markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know how people are doing it,'' said Rachel Ranis, a sociology professor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden. ''It's very hard for any family to buy in this market unless both parties are working.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time it has become harder for many to enter the housing market, and those who do make it want even more once they get there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People's expectations have gotten higher,'' she said. ''Before, we were happy to have just one car in a household. Now, everyone has to have a car. If you buy a house, everyone has to have a room. People have changed a lot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has remained largely constant, Professor Ranis said, are the forces that drive homebuyers into the suburbs around the region -- the quest for bigger yards, better schools and perhaps a slower, more measured pace of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Ranis noted that another factor appears to be playing a larger role: worry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One thing we find is that you're worried that you will be able to duplicate what you've always considered middle class,'' she said. ''The key value is how to keep yourself where you are and your children, how to give them the best start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of pressure on people to keep up with what they're accustomed to,'' she said. ''It's no longer about keeping up with the neighbor next door, it's their own wants and what they're accustomed to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the status-conscious suburbs, a larger home is still the No.1 symbol of success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The ones who are doing well, you see people going out and getting bigger and bigger houses,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''You look at some of these homes that have closets the size of my bedroom when I grew up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the reason size matters?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the symbol of your achievement, the symbol of your status,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''It puts a premium on those homes with the center hall and the chandelier and all this space where you can demonstrate your lifestyle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While practically no one would prefer that a community be poorer rather than richer, some experts wonder about the effects of such changes on the character of established middle-class communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of the suburbs that have maintained quality housing have become more and more exclusive,'' Dr. Fainstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More exclusive perhaps, but also, say some, communities in high-priced markets grow less diverse and its residents less connected socially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has a huge impact of community connectedness,'' said Robert Fisher, the director of urban and community studies at the University of Connecticut's West Hartford campus. ''The issue of social connectedness, a lot of that has to do with destabilization. While bringing affluence into these communities, a lot of people are pushed out as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to mention, Dr. Fisher said, those who because of high prices never get to enter some communities in the first place. ''What's happening is that the American dream is a little bit less within the reach of a lot of people,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing Pains</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Mr. Gadbois retired, he worked for decades as a pipe fitter -- Local 305 and 777, he said, even in retirement, still union and still proud -- the kind of solidly middle-class tradesman who was once common in East Lyme. Now, according to census figures, better than one out of every four residents of the Gadboises' census tract reported that they worked in managerial, professional or business fields. And experts say that that number, like most everything else around East Lyme, is growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The town has grown so dramatically and the changes are so great you wonder what's going to happen next,'' said Wilbur Beckwith, an East Lyme native and the town's official historian. At 74, Mr. Beckwith has seen much of the evolution of East Lyme firsthand. ''Before World War II the population was about 2,000,'' Mr. Beckwith said, noting that today it is nearly 10 times that figure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">East Lyme, formed in 1839 by secessionists from neighboring Waterford and Lyme for reasons that Mr. Beckwith, who traces his ancestry to some of them, said are lost to time, was a place of farmers and fishermen well into the 20th century. When he was a child, Mr. Beckwith said, the town was a thinly populated slice of the hinterlands that made New London, about eight miles down the road, seem like nothing less than a teeming metropolis by comparison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New London was sort of the car city,'' Mr. Beckwith said. ''Kids from Niantic'' -- part of East Lyme town -- ''were called clam diggers, you know, hicks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There used to be chicken farms,'' he continued. ''Now, nobody raises chickens in town anymore. And you'll only find the older folks doing some recreational clamming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">East Lyme began to change with the growth of the suburbs that followed World War II. The area is home to the United States Coast Guard Academy, the Naval Submarine Base, the drug manufacturer <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> and the Electric Boat unit of the <span class="companylink">General Dynamics Corporation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once a dominant presence with upward of 20,000 employees, Electric Boat laid off thousands of employees in the mid-1990's. The company's post-cold war downsizing was a defining moment for the region. ''It really cut the heart out of the middle class in New London County,'' Dr. Howes said. The jobs now being created in the area are more of a mix, with higher-income jobs at companies like <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> and lower-wage jobs at the nearby casinos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Pfizer</span>, which already had a base of operations across the Thames in Groton, completed a Global Research and Development Facility on the New London side of the river in 2001. <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> officials say the research center, which covers 750,000 square feet and cost nearly $300 million to build, has brought at least 1,500 employees to the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To meet the influx of new residents, home builders have not exactly thrown caution to the winds. According to the town's figures, from April 2002 to April 2003 this community of about 35 square miles averaged little more than one new housing start a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of population growth, new money, low mortgage rates and a modest level of residential construction has made life interesting for local real estate agents like Mark E. Landry, who has been a seller in the area for the last five years -- just about the length of the latest boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The business has picked up steadily over the years,'' Mr. Landry said. ''There's just not enough housing to go around to supply the need.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result has sometimes been bidding wars between buyers, with some agents noting winning bids that are as much as $50,000 over the original asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's competitive,'' Mr. Landry said. ''You're going to get top dollar.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Landry pulled a chair over to a computer screen in his office at Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage on Flanders Road in Niantic and punched a few keys to bring up the entries on the Multiple Listing Service, the shared database used by real estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This one sold for $10,000 over asking price,'' he said, his finger moving over a thumbnail photo of a recently built condominium townhouse in New London that sold for $175,000. Last year, he said, that property might have sold for $25,000 less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He mentioned a burst of new construction north of East Lyme, near Norwich. He fingered a few more keys on the computer and up popped a handful of listings for condominiums in the Norwich area, near the Mohegan Sun Resort Casino in Uncasville.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three bedrooms. Sixteen hundred square feet. All selling for more than $350,000. Even Mr. Landry seemed surprised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was asked what those properties would have sold for a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They didn't have anything like that a year ago,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drawing Point: the School</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the next few weeks, Lily Tong and her family will move into their custom-built four-bedroom home in a slice of East Lyme that didn't exist until recently: the Heritage Fields subdivision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A nine-year resident of next-door Waterford, Ms. Tong and her husband, Jim Lua, studied many communities that dot Connecticut's southern shore as they searched for a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They, like so many others, were charmed by East Lyme. When they did not find an existing home that they liked among the colonials, ranches and splits that make up most of the housing stock here, they decided to build their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We felt that this was the place we liked most,'' said Ms. Tong, 44.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So armed with a $100,000 profit from her Waterford home, Ms. Tong and her family began looking. And once they settled on a location and design, they were willing to wait for what they wanted. For the last eight months, Ms. Tong, her husband and their two children, ages 9 and 14, have lived in a rental property until their home is completed later this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tongs are typical of many who are moving to East Lyme. Ms. Tong works at <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> and her husband at Anteon, a government contractor in Mystic. With their dual incomes and professional backgrounds, they are emblematic of the upper-middle class infusion here. And as Asian Americans, they are part of the Census Bureau's ''other'' group, the nonwhites, nonblacks, non-Hispanics who, according to census figures, tripled in number in the area surrounding East Lyme in the 1990's. Blacks and Hispanics each fell to about 1 percent of the census tract's population, down from 6 percent and 3 percent respectively. Besides location, location, location, Ms. Tong said that her family chose East Lyme for another reason: schools, schools, schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high school has become a perennial winner of prestigious education awards and has a sterling reputation in the region. In fact, Ms. Tong said, the school may have played as big a role in her home purchase as anything else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't matter how good the price is,'' she said. ''If it's not a good system, we wouldn't buy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The role of the school district in bringing in people like Ms. Tong and her family is not lost on Dr. John F. Reynolds, superintendent of the roughly 3,500-student East Lyme School District.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a neat place,'' Dr. Reynolds said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, often, the district finds itself being criticized for its own success. According to town figures, more than three quarters of East Lyme residents do not have school-age children, making for contentious school budget votes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often the superintendent finds himself having to explain how the benefits of good schools spill over even to those who do not have children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to ask, are we going to have a system that is a source of pride?'' he said. ''Or is it just something that they think is just going to raise their taxes?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rapprochement of sorts may have been reached recently when a measure to construct a new swimming pool for the district was ratified by voters, including many of the town's older residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key to the victory? It was promised that the pool would be open to all in the town, not just students. Gaining that kind of buy-in, Dr. Reynolds said, stems from preaching an open door policy and budget efficiencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We got them in,'' he said. ''And we've got to keep finding ways to get them in. You have to say to folks, 'If you give me a dime, I'll get 11 cents out of it.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currents of Change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides schools, many here are also concerned about the effects of the growing population on local businesses. Already a Super Stop&amp; Shop is under construction along Flanders Road, much to the chagrin of longtime residents who have been accustomed to more intimate stores and boutiques around town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while some are resistant to change, others like Candy Shapiro, president of Niantic Main Street, an association of business owners, are trying to be like Connecticut birches and stay rooted while bending with the breeze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're on the verge of just an explosive market here,'' said Ms. Shapiro, who runs a haberdashery on Main Street called Gracie, Gracie. ''If the smaller stores are going to thrive, they're going to have to find their niche.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that might mean finding an upscale specialty that caters to those moving into the community. ''Change is always going to be uncomfortable for some,'' Ms. Shapiro said. The key, she added, is ''that it doesn't destroy the essence of the town.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the future of East Lyme may remain uncertain, what's clear is that the changes here have made people like Mr. Gadbois uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This town is being developed too fast,'' said Mr. Gadbois, who remains dissatisfied about the town's current course. ''You just can't keep on building and developing without a plan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gadbois said that much of the development in the region has seemed haphazard. For instance, he said, within just a few miles of his home there are two <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> stores and two Dunkin' Donuts. ''I don't know which one they want me to go to,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides that, he said, he is concerned that some of his fellow retirees who live on fixed incomes are being forced out of the town by rising tax bills. ''I know somebody who had to move down to Florida,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect sends a shudder through Mr. Gadbois and his wife, who have lived in East Lyme all of their lives, save one year immediately after their marriage 40 years ago when they lived in New London while they saved to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, their roots go deep. And while they understand that they may not be able to stop the continuing growth and development in their beloved town, they hope to prompt further discussion about where it is headed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know that things do change and people have to change,'' Mrs. Gadbois said. ''But when we get to where we want to go, we have to ask, 'Is that really where we want to be?'''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW ROCHELLE -- ALBERT W. LIAN fancies himself something of a pioneer. Three decades ago, when other homebuyers were making places like Larchmont and Rye some of the hottest real estate markets in Westchester County, Mr. Lian turned his gaze to New Rochelle, a hot spot from an earlier era that had gone cold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My wife and I were house-hunting and I said, 'Let's go north,''' recalled Mr. Lian, who was living in Brooklyn before he bought his New Rochelle home in 1971. ''I found this place, about 20 rooms. They couldn't wait to get rid of it. Paid $55,000 for it. It was a good deal.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lian, now 75, put his house on the market in early March. And that good deal? Well, he figures that today his house could fetch seven figures. ''I put a lot of money into it,'' he said proudly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, New Rochelle was the place bargain hunters went for a Westchester County address without paying Westchester County prices. (Bargain, of course, is a relative term in a county where a mid-to-upper-six-figure home has long been the standard in places like Scarsdale.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over the last few years, real estate agents and housing experts say, any bargains that might have remained in New Rochelle have just about vanished. Prices there may never rival Scarsdale's, but real estate agents say some New Rochelle properties have doubled their value since the start of the millennium. The relatively low supply of houses available has meant bidding wars, a reflection of the strong seller's market. Historically low mortgage rates have given an additional boost to prices. People who want to move out of the city to the suburbs to have more room and a different school equation for their children have continued to flood to Westchester and other suburbs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One place where the result is seen is in the census tract that includes New Rochelle, which experienced the county's highest percentage increase in family income from 1990 to 2000, which reflects the higher incomes needed to buy these more expensive houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sellers and experts say that another byproduct of this real estate boom is that some middle-class buyers are being priced out of the market before they can even enter it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents say that while a decent New Rochelle house could be had for about $200,000 as recently as half a decade ago, there's virtually nothing left on the market now for less than $300,000 and the typical price is about $400,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While real estate agents almost giddily describe the sometimes-fevered pitch of the market here, some also feel a twinge of sympathy for those unable to jump into a market that had been a refuge for middle-class and younger buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Easy?'' asked Joanmarie Tully O'Connor, the listing agent for Mr. Lian's home, in response to a question about pitching properties to potential buyers here. ''It's easy for us. It doesn't make it any easier for our first-time buyers. Can you imagine what our kids are going to have to pay?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Two Middle Classes  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the forces at play here in New Rochelle are noteworthy, experts say they are not unique. Neighborhoods all over the metropolitan region are seeing home prices rising so sharply that most of the people who live in them couldn't afford to buy there if they had to do it all over again. Sociologists and economists say it simply costs more for a middle-class family to stay in the middle. Some experts see a widening gulf in the middle of the middle class, separating those who have and those who have more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester County, a place that is routinely referred to as affluent, there are great extremes of wealth and poverty, and then, somewhere in the middle, is a middle class whose definition is at best slippery. Nationally, if a family's annual income is $75,000, by most definitions the family belongs to the middle class. By that standard a low six-figure income would put a Westchester family in the upper middle class nationally -- yet that family may well not be a position to buy a house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More and more it's a case of winners and losers in the middle class,'' said Susan S. Fainstein, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University. ''There are two groups. If you have a secure and steady job, own a home, you can be doing quite well. Then there are all those people who are on a slippery slope who are afraid that they're going to lose their job or that it will go off to India.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're the ones who are the forgotten middle class,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Fainstein said that those most affected by skyrocketing home values in the region are first-time buyers and the young.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The people for whom it's really hard are people just entering the housing market, young couples, people without a nest egg or without parents who can help them,'' she said. ''They're the middle class that's downwardly mobile, because even if you have a decent income, who has $60,000 in the bank for a down payment when they just got out of college or graduate school or wherever?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current tightening of the real estate market in the New York metropolitan region is simple supply and demand. Because there is little affordable housing being built, whatever existing quality housing stock remains is sometimes fought over by prospective buyers with dueling bids.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which serves to price large segments of the middle class out of some real estate markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know how people are doing it,'' said Rachel Ranis, a sociology professor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn. ''It's very hard for any family to buy in this market unless both parties are working.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it has become harder for many to enter the housing market, those who do make it want even more once they get there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People's expectations have gotten higher,'' she said. ''Before, we were happy to have just one car in a household. Now, everyone has to have a car. If you buy a house, everyone has to have a room. People have changed a lot.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has remained largely constant, Professor Ranis said, are the forces that drive homebuyers into the suburbs around the region -- the quest for bigger yards, better schools and perhaps a slower, more measured pace of living.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Ranis noted that another factor appears to be playing a larger role: worry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One thing we find is that you're worried that you will be able to duplicate what you've always considered middle class,'' she said. ''The key value is how to keep yourself where you are and your children, how to give them the best start.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of pressure on people to keep up with what they're accustomed to,'' she said. ''It's no longer about keeping up with the neighbor next door, it's their own wants and what they're accustomed to.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the status-conscious suburbs, a larger home is still the No. 1 symbol of success.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The ones who are doing well, you see people going out and getting bigger and bigger houses,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''You look at some of these homes that have closets the size of my bedroom when I grew up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the reason size matters?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the symbol of your achievement, the symbol of your status,'' Dr. Fainstein said. ''It puts a premium on those homes with the center hall and the chandelier and all this space where you can demonstrate your lifestyle.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While practically no one would prefer that a community be poorer rather than richer, some experts wonder about the effects of such changes on the character of established middle-class communities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of the suburbs that have maintained quality housing have become more and more exclusive,'' Dr. Fainstein said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More exclusive perhaps, but also, some say, communities in high-priced markets grow less diverse and their residents less connected socially.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has a huge impact on community connectedness,'' said Robert Fisher, the director of urban and community studies at the University of Connecticut's West Hartford campus. ''The issue of social connectedness, a lot of that has to do with destabilization. While bringing affluence into these communities, a lot of people are pushed out as well.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Left unmentioned sometimes, Dr. Fisher said, are those who because of high prices never get to enter some communities in the first place. ''What's happening is that the American dream is a little bit less within the reach of a lot of people,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right Address, Best Value  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carving out a place of one's own has been a part of the makeup of New Rochelle since the first European settlers took note of what was then pristine, arable land here along the banks of Long Island Sound more than 300 years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Settled in 1689, New Rochelle was born when John Pell sold more than 6,000 acres of land to the French Huguenots, who came to the New World to escape religious persecution. The town takes its name from the former French Huguenot stronghold, La Rochelle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 1700, the town already had the beginnings of a solid infrastructure - including a constabulary and fence inspectors, according to Barbara Davis, New Rochelle's acting town historian.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It really gave this community a head start,'' said Ms. Davis, who also works as the community relations coordinator at the New Rochelle Public Library.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that head start proved vital as, over roughly the next century and half, New Rochelle evolved from a farming community into a mill town and ultimately a resort town by the Sound frequented by tens of thousands of thousands of people from New York City.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So many wealthy Manhattanites came here, saw how great it was, liked it and built their summer homes here,'' Ms. Davis said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toward the latter part of the 19th century, those same Manhattanites began coming to New Rochelle and staying full time. After the founding of the some of the town's earliest neighborhoods like Rochelle Park in the 1880's, people began moving to New Rochelle in droves.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 1900 and 1930, Ms. Davis said, the city's population quadrupled. New Rochelle was reputed to be the wealthiest city in New York State and the third richest in the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came the Depression. And while people everywhere suffered, the contrast between suburban life before the stock market crash and after it played out starkly in New Rochelle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This community was hit especially hard,'' Ms. Davis said, noting that when she combs through city records to trace the history of home ownership in certain areas she would often find only the name of a bank in the space reserved for the owner.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city began recovering after World War II, as the G.I. Bill brought in new waves of homeowners and spurred intense development. And since the war, New Rochelle has enjoyed a reputation as less expensive, less homogeneous and less stiff neighbor to more upper-crust communities like Scarsdale.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's for someone who's attracted to the Scarsdale address but doesn't want to pay that price,'' Ms. Davis said. ''You could get value for your dollar. If you put these houses in Rye it might be $200,000 more.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the home prices here might never approach those of this city's more upper-class neighbors, New Rochelle residents like Ms. Davis have noticed a perceptible change.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's really phenomenal what's happened,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local Orthodox Jewish community is growing, but some real estate agents and others in the community say that the growth here began shortly after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was the environmental issue, the dust, or they had homes in the area'' directly affected by the attacks, said Connie Caglioti, a real estate agent with Oshlag-Eisner Realty. ''Some were planning to have children and wanted to move, some had children, for some it was such an emotional issue that they wanted to flee.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other experts are reluctant to attribute many of the recent arrivals to 9/11. But the economic factors that are fattening real estate values across the nation are still at work here too, defying widespread expectations that the local market would cool.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We thought the housing market would come to a standstill and prices would go down,'' Ms. Caglioti said. ''They didn't.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only did the high prices remain, some agents say that many potential buyers try to capitalize on the rising values by ''flipping'' properties - buying homes and selling them quickly to turn a profit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People buy things, flip them and double their money,'' said Hillary Brizell-DeLise, who sold homes in New Rochelle for five years before recently joining an agency in Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Real estate is an investment,'' she said. ''It's very utilitarian. It's been the most secure kind of investment. Who knows what the stock market is going to do?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other draws for the market are New Rochelle's livability (with 72,000 people, it still retains vestiges of a small-town feel), proximity to Manhattan (''45 Minutes From Broadway,'' was the title George M. Cohan, a New Rochelle resident, gave to his 1906 musical about his town) and cultural diversity (according to census figures, the nonwhite population in the census tract that includes New Rochelle doubled to 14 percent in 2000 from about 7 percent in 1990).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Economics of Diversity  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in this city that was scarred in the 1960's by one of the nation's first major court-ordered school desegregation cases north of the Mason-Dixon line, some agents concede that the city's diversity is viewed as a weakness by some buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people will come into the community because they want their children to grow up in the real world,'' Ms. Brizell-DeLise said. ''And some people will insist that they want a community that has more snobbery.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Brizell-DeLise said that the rising prices have not proved a bar to diversity in the city. She estimates that fully half of her clients when she worked in New Rochelle were members of minority groups.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, she said, some people, both members of minority groups and others, were priced out of the market by rising home values. But, she said, usually the most relevant color was green.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The prices, when they spike, they close out a few,'' said Ms. Brizell-DeLise, noting that some -- put off by the prices of stand-alone, single-family homes -- choose condominiums or co-ops instead. ''There are some people who weren't able to buy no matter the background because they couldn't catch a deal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are people who are successful in all backgrounds and they are happy to come to New Rochelle,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Census figures show that the city has become more diversified, particularly where Hispanics are concerned. While African-Americans and Asian-Americans experienced modest percentage increases here from 1990 to 2000 -- holding steady at around 19 percent and 3 percent respectively -- the city's Hispanic population doubled and sits at about 21.5 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing that kind of growth, the city and its school district play up the more down-to-earth and culturally diverse aspects of their community. The school district - which agents said is a major selling point for buyers -- is a melange, 44 percent white, 28 percent African-American, 22 percent Hispanic. ''And the rest'' - about 6 percent - ''is just like the United Nations,'' said Linda E. Kelly, the district's superintendent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides a more diverse student body, the superintendent said that over the last decade and a half the district has witnessed a sharp increase in the sheer volume of students it serves. Since 1991, the population of the district has increased by almost half - to roughly 11,000 students today from 7,600 then.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That growth reflects the changes in New Rochelle and, Ms. Kelly said, puts a little pressure on the district to maintain its high standards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Who was it that said the only problem with being successful is that you have to keep on being successful?'' she said. ''But we try not to look at it as pressure but as an obligation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Running to Stay Even  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether potential buyers are drawn to New Rochelle for its schools, location or some other reason, Ms. Brizell-DeLise said that they might want to act quickly because at the rate values change here, a home's price tag can grow significantly in the months between when a house-hunt begins and an offer is made.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's sad in a way because people are feeling ready to move and they start looking and by the time they're ready to buy, things have gotten away from them,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was what seemed to keep happening to Helene Wald. For nearly three years, she searched for an alternative to the place that she, her husband and daughter were renting in Riverdale, only to see the benchmarks for home prices continue to increase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You think they're going to get better,'' Ms. Wald, 55, said of the prices. ''But it keeps getting worse.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her family narrowed their search to a handful of communities before settling in Eastchester, not far from New Rochelle. It was a 50-year-old home that needed a little work. But, besides being in a good school district, it fit another very important criteria for Ms. Wald.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was under $500,000,'' she said. ''And to find that in Westchester County is almost unheard of these days. To find a house in the mid-400's is getting harder and harder.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the family - first-time homebuyers - moved in last fall, they've been mostly about the business of renovation. New carpets. New kitchen. But they're also finding a range of new suburban experiences.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As an owner, I'm kind of a late bloomer,'' she said. ''I'm learning about gardening, trying to get used to shoveling snow.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waiting for the Right Offer  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albert Lian hopes that the market holds at least another late bloomer or two.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife, Joan, raised their four children in New Rochelle in the decades after they first spotted the good buy on Lovell Road. Now, the children are all grown and gone. Mrs. Lian died in 1995, and Mr. Lian finds himself alone with his memories.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm sitting here by myself in 19 rooms,'' Mr. Lian said. ''Would you stay here?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Lian had his druthers, he would rather be at the exclusive Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, where he is a member. ''I used to be scratch,'' he said. ''Now I'm about a 14 handicap.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former corporate personal injury defense lawyer who worked in Manhattan, Mr. Lian came to New Rochelle 30 years ago for the same reasons buyers continue to find themselves drawn to this corner of Westchester County today - schools and the commute, which he found was even better than Mr. Cohan's estimates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was in New York in a half hour,'' he said. ''I didn't even get a chance to finish the paper.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After retiring several years ago, Mr. Lian noticed that there was a growing distance between himself and his neighbors, some of whom are new arrivals. ''I live in this beautiful house and I don't even know my next-door neighbors,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That distance and the loss of several close friends convinced him it was time to move. ''I'm losing a lot of guys,'' he said. ''Everybody's dying on me.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So these days he mostly shows prospective buyers around his proud old home - the antique furniture that was passed down from his parents, the expensive rugs - and waiting for the right offer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lian said he hopes to remain in the area. He expects that he'll use the money from the sale of his house to buy a condominium. He's not looking for anything fancy. Just something close to Winged Foot.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS though her convoluted deal of nine years ago did not already constitute a broker's symphony -- juggling all interested parties so that three apartments on the same floor of a Park Avenue co-op building could be sold and converted into one -- Suzanne Sealy has written a coda.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a market of constricted inventory, Ms. Sealy of the William B. May brokerage company recently persuaded the owners of that grand 3,400-square-foot apartment to relinquish their dream home, to sell it to a new buyer and then to buy another, somewhat smaller, apartment a few blocks north on Park Avenue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I really had to scurry around to find something for them,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such are the lengths to which brokers in the upscale environs of Manhattan and Brooklyn Heights go these days as listings have dwindled, bringing prices and buyer frustrations to a boil. In the other boroughs and through much of the suburban ring around New York City, however, a more balanced market equation has prevailed over the last year, with inventory warming or cooling from community to community and prices percolating upward.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, despite some dire predictions (and certainly a temporary partial paralysis) after the Sept. 11 attacks two and a half years ago, the New York region's real estate market has continued to simmer, analysts and participants say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Jason Bram, a regional economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, put it: ''If you had told somebody at the beginning of 2001 that the regional economy would be hit by a national recession, a steep downturn in its key financial sector and the destruction of the World Trade Center, they would have found it unimaginable that the housing market would hold up this well, let alone spiral upward as it seems to be doing now. Yet that's what's happened.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One broad-brush indicator comes from the massive national database of sales compiled by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. According to the federal data, average home prices in New York State rose by 11.6 percent between the fourth quarter of 2002 and the fourth quarter of 2003 (the housing enterprise office does not provide dollar figures). New Jersey saw an even higher increase during the year, 12.1 percent. In Connecticut, the increase was 9.5 percent. All three states surpassed the national increase of 8 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has been no easing at all in price patterns,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''And sustained low interest rates certainly have had the effect of increasing housing purchasing power, even if incomes are stable.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A stable market with healthy price increases is apparent, for instance, in the 14-county swath of northern and central New Jersey surveyed by the Otteau Appraisal Group, based in East Brunswick. As of Jan. 31, there were 18,471 properties listed throughout the 14 counties, just 43 more than the 18,428 listings at the end of January 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales, too, held steady. In January of this year, taken alone, 4,795 homes were sold throughout the 14-county area, five more than the 4,790 sold in January 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet prices ratcheted up. In Morris County, as of March 1, the median price for all homes sold during the previous 12 months was $413,977, a 9 percent increase over the $379,935 median for homes sold during the year that ended March 1, 2003. In Sussex, the median price for the year that ended March 1 was $250,002, 16 percent higher than the $215,389 price during the previous year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the confines of Manhattan, however, the squeeze was on.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Wall Street's stocks and bonuses on the rebound and more and more people willing -- but often unable -- to move up, said Jonathan Miller, president of the Miller Samuel appraisal company, ''lack of supply is really the story of the current market.'' Mr. Miller's company prepares the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report, which surveys the listings of 14 major brokerage firms from the Battery to West 116th Street and East 96th Street.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 3,994 apartments listed in the area as of March 1, Mr. Miller said, a 34.5 percent drop from the 6,096 listings available on March 1, 2003. Meanwhile, the median price for all properties sold between Jan. 1 and March 1 of this year was $590,000, up 16.8 percent over the median price of $505,000 for units sold during the comparable period last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Particularly striking is the fact that in the third quarter of last year, when Manhattan's median price stood at $575,000, its average price hit a record of $916,959. (The gap stems from the fact that while the median represents the precise midpoint of all sales, the average price includes all sales, with a significant number of high-end Manhattan properties skewing the average upward.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No doubt the average was tweaked a bit by the highest price ever paid for a Manhattan apartment: the $45 million sale last September of a 12,544-square-foot duplex penthouse with 1,960 square feet of terrace overlooking Central Park at the new Time Warner Center. And farther north than the sales included in the Elliman survey, the $1,150,000 paid recently for a renovated town house on West 137th Street in Harlem is an indication of Manhattan demand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every listing that comes on is selling in a nanosecond,'' said Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what seem like flashbacks to the Manhattan market frenzy of the late 90's, Ms. Corcoran said: ''Open houses are out of control. Many buildings are putting a limit on the number of people allowed in, and they are making people sign in like a doctor's office. Multiple-bid stories are too exhausting to repeat.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So she did: ''There is a three-bedroom postwar on East 73rd and Second Avenue. The listing came out on Tuesday morning March 2. We had nine offers the first day.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The seller instructed us to tell everyone that they needed to give their highest and best price by noon that Friday,'' Ms. Corcoran continued. ''Seven offers came in by noon that day. The other two bidders came in after the deadline, but the owners refused their bids, even though they were higher.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment, originally listed for $1.22 million, sold for $1.4 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond Manhattan  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Healthy Markets, Skewed to Sellers  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not quite so striking, though once again indicative of a healthy market, are the figures for other boroughs and suburbs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Queens, for example, according to the Long Island Board of Realtors, which covers that borough as well as Nassau and Suffolk Counties, there were 4,184 listings available at the end of January, an 8.4 percent increase from the 3,860 listings available in January 2003. And over the year the median price for a home in Queens rose 6 percent, from $313,000 in January of 2003 to $332,000 in January of this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar trends were apparent in Nassau, where listings at the end of January stood at 3,556, a 9.7 percent increase over the 3,241 available properties in January of 2003, while the median price rose 13.1 percent to $401,500 this January, compared with $355,000 last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Suffolk, while listings slipped just a bit -- 2.3 percent -- from 5,125 in January of last year to 5,003 in January this year, the median price jumped 12.5 percent, from $278,000 to $313,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're approaching a more stable market,'' said Jane Salamon, president of the Long Island Board of Realtors, ''one that reflects more of a balance between buyers and sellers. It's been skewed more toward sellers.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the traditional spring buying season, business in the region seemed hearty. ''For Sale'' signs had been planted in snow-carpeted front lawns, here and there, both in suburbanized sections of the city and surrounding counties, -- some already bearing ''Sold'' stickers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester, inventory has held steady, according to the county's board of realtors, with 2,026 listings at the end of last year, compared with 2,121 in December 2002. That despite rapid sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're talking about a signed unconditional contract within a week,'' said Ruth Burger of the Julia B. Fee brokerage in Scarsdale. A four-bedroom colonial on 1.9 acres in the northern Westchester community of Somers, shown on a recent Sunday, immediately received several bids above its $789,000 asking price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for Westchester homes as of Jan. 1 was $545,000, a 5 percent increase over $520,000 at the end of 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comprehensive statistics for Connecticut are not available. But in Greenwich, Barbara Webski of the Coldwell Banker brokerage firm said: ''The upper market is coming back. We just had an accepted offer in Belle Haven for $14.9 million.'' And in Norwalk, Maggie Teed, owner of the Real Estate Marketing Group, said, ''Anything under $400,000 is gone right away.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-End Brooklyn  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Severe Scarcity Of Upscale Listings  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dichotomy of high-end fever and more moderately warming market segments plays out, particularly, in Brooklyn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This year to last year, that's March 1 to March 1, we're down 36 percent in total listings,'' said Christopher Thomas, the William B. May company's vice president for Brooklyn. ''The larger the living space, the more scarce it is.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thomas's company concentrates on the borough's higher-end neighborhoods, like Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Prospect Lefferts and Boerum Hill.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes the dearth of listings in those tonier Brooklyn districts is rooted in Manhattan. ''Several weeks ago we had a situation where a seller listed a property -- a small carriage house, private garden and parking in Brooklyn Heights -- at what all our agents felt was a very optimistic asking price, $995,000,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''He immediately had four offers, three exceeding the asking price.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller accepted an offer, then tried to complete a deal he was already negotiating for an apartment in Manhattan. ''He went back to the seller in Manhattan and discovered that there were now a half a dozen other offers, all above the asking price,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''In order to purchase that apartment, he had to exceed the above-asking price he had settled for on his carriage house.'' The man stayed put.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For much of the rest of Brooklyn, however, the story line differs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, the borough's South Shore Multiple Listing Service and Midcounty Multiple Listing Service combined to create the Brooklyn Multiple Listing Service, covering most of the borough. The new service's combined statistics indicate a substantial growth in inventory and a less drastic increase in median price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 12 months that ended March 1, said Gerard Longo, president of Madison Estates &amp; Properties in Marine Park and a director of Brooklyn's expanded listing service, 13,700 properties came on the market, compared with 10,549 the previous year -- a 30 percent increase. Median prices during the corresponding periods rose less than 1 percent, from $456,000 to $460,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is more inventory out there, but demand is still vigorous, pushing up prices,'' Mr. Longo said. ''What we see is people not leaving Brooklyn, but trading up in size and staying in the borough.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demographics  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dynamics Of Baby Boomers  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That urge to trade up in a recovering economy, particularly among people maturing into their full-family and peak-earning years, say real estate specialists, is largely responsible for the market squeeze in affluent communities, suburban or urban. In a kind of self-perpetuating tangle, the demand of those seeking to trade up pushes up prices so that owners who might consider selling to them end up staying put because they are not sure they can afford to trade up. And in the even more moneyed precincts of places like Manhattan, the inventory is, to begin with, severely constricted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Demand is driven by the baby boomers, 40 to 58 years of age,'' said Dr. Hughes at Rutgers, ''although it's a slightly younger boomer population that prevails in suburbia. And they are trading up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are moving to the house where they want to finish raising their children in the community they really want,'' Dr. Hughes continued. ''So single-family trade-ups have been been extraordinarily strong.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in Manhattan, said Ms. Corcoran of the Corcoran Group: ''There's just much more money around now for good real estate. The high end of the market went dead for two to three years, but the Wall Street crowd has now brought the market right back over the top.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, she said: ''People aren't leaving for the suburbs like they used to. Retirees aren't going to Florida. And empty-nesters from the suburbs want to move back to the city.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of that, Dr. Hughes concurred, ''increases the demand side of the equation in the region's walkable activity areas -- the Manhattan neighborhoods where you can walk to dinner, to the museums, take a short taxi ride to cultural destinations. Same for areas of Brooklyn that have their own high amenity levels, but also are closely tied to the unique attractions of Manhattan.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor contributing to the inventory crunch, said Mr. Miller of the Miller Samuel appraisal company, has been ''a real change from buyer patterns of four or five years ago.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buyers are not listing their apartments until they find an apartment to purchase,'' he said. ''So it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: you're not going to sell until you buy, so there's limited choices to purchase.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, said Ms. Corcoran, ''Many sellers are reneging on accepted offers a few days later as the reality hits, 'Where the heck am I going to move?' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers -- like Ms. Sealy of the Park Avenue triple-apartment combination -- are left to scurry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in '95, two apartments on the same floor of 1100 Park Avenue, at 89th Street, were already on the market when the owner of the apartment between them died. With all due haste, Ms. Sealy pulled together the heirs to the middle apartment, the woman on one side -- ''she was very tough, held out for full asking'' -- and, by ship-to-shore radio, the owner of the third apartment. ''He was floating around the Mediterranean on a yacht,'' Ms. Sealy said. ''The phone bill came through at at least $143.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total price for the three apartments, back then -- hard to believe now -- was $795,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flash forward to last fall: a client asks Ms. Sealy to find him a three-bedroom with a dining room, a maid's room and a library in a white-glove building. Ms. Sealy recalls the triple apartment at 1100 Park Avenue. The daughter of the couple living there has gone off to college.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I put in a call,'' Ms. Sealy said. ''They said, 'O.K., we'll show it one time; he can make an offer then and there.' That was it.'' The price -- $3.2 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in a market of meager inventory, Ms. Sealy managed to find a smaller three-bedroom for the couple selling the triple, this one farther north on Park Avenue, and brokered a $2.8 million deal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It, too, was an estate sale.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are two ways we get listings these days,'' Ms. Sealy said, ''D&amp;D's -- death and divorce. So I got two deals out of it, and I was happy as could be.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders broke ground at a slower-than-expected pace in February, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Bad weather also played a part in the decline, and economists said housing could regain some momentum because of a recent decline in mortgage rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts on new housing fell 4 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.855 million compared with January, well below the 1.93 million Wall Street analysts projected. January housing starts were revised upward to a 1.932 million pace from 1.903 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a huge disappointment relative to expectations,'' said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisers. But he added: ''Fundamentals are still strong for the housing market. It should get a second wind from the drop in rates.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the mortgage finance company Freddie Mac, the average interest rate on 30-year fixed mortgages was 5.64 percent in February, the lowest since July 2003, and rates have fallen further this month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing permits, an indicator of builders' confidence, also dipped in February, down 1.5 percent, to a 1.903 million annual pace, a figure in line with Wall Street projections.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts were up in the Northeast and Midwest but down in the larger markets of the South and West. Starts rose 25.3 percent in the Northeast, to a 188,000 pace, the fastest since February 1988. In the Midwest, they were up 7.1 percent, to a 349,000 pace. In the South, housing starts fell 10.6 percent, to an annual 839,000, and in the West, they were down 7.5 percent to a 479,000 pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While February's data was weaker than expected, the overall level was up 13.1 percent compared with February 2003.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">'Mr. Affordable Housing'  </span>
</div><div>845 words</div><div>14 March 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEVE LEVY, Suffolk's county executive, says that affordable housing is one of his highest priorities, and last month he named Jim Morgo to lead a commission to get the job done.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morgo, the chairman of the Suffolk County Workforce Housing Commission, believes that swift advances may now be possible. ''There has never before been this kind of confluence of interests working together,'' he said in an interview last week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is creating an atmosphere of crisis, Mr. Morgo and other advocates said, is mounting statistical evidence that a rapidly increasing number of younger residents, including tens of thousands of people with good jobs, college degrees and professional training, cannot afford a place to live on Long Island.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report released last month by the Rauch Foundation of Garden City provided a new piece of pressing evidence. It said that during the 1990's, the number of Long Island residents between 18 and 34 declined by 143,184, or 20 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morgo, the president of the Long Island Housing Partnership in Hauppauge, a nonprofit group that develops houses and apartments and arranges financing for low- and middle-income residents, described the new commission's initial meetings as ''wild and woolly because people really want to get things done.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 24-member commission includes county, town, village and school officials as well as builders, environmentalists, bankers and business leaders. ''Workforce housing'' in its name is defined as housing that is affordable for a family of four making $67,000 a year, or 80 percent of Long Island's median annual income. The commission's charter calls for making an inventory of possible housing sites, trying to streamline the process of getting permits, persuading towns and villages to rezone or develop new zoning, and offering incentives to builders. The commission is also looking at sewage treatment technology that could allow denser development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven C. Bellone, a commission member who is the Town of Babylon's supervisor, said he foresaw a lessening of the frequently fierce local opposition to moderately priced housing projects.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The ground has shifted on this issue,'' Mr. Bellone said. ''When it starts to affect you personally, it has the impact of changing your position. It's affecting residents because it's affecting their kids, and it's going to get much worse if we don't take action.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morgo agreed. ''Now we are talking about losing the sons and daughters of the middle class,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another commission member, Jay H. Schneiderman, the former East Hampton supervisor who is now a county legislator, said that Suffolk could play the same leading role in promoting affordable housing that it had in protecting farmland and open space. He called for a new low-interest loan program for first-time home buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others said that local governments might well support rental apartments in downtown areas that have been drained by malls and big-box retailers. ''When you have nothing else to lose, you will try just about anything, and most downtowns on Long Island in one way or anther are struggling,'' said Kevin McDonald, a commission member who is the vice president of the Group for the South Fork in Bridgehampton, an environmental and planning organization.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Petrone, a commission member who is Huntington's town supervisor, is taking a wait-and-see attitude. He said that he did not yet have enough information about the tax impact of moderately priced housing. ''What are the impacts on the schools?'' he said. ''Your affordable components are no longer affordable once they have to build a new school.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Long Island Association is leading a coalition in calling on the Island's nine state senators, all Republicans, to approve a bill that would require that any new housing development in Nassau and Suffolk set aside 10 percent of its units as affordable housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is considerable momentum behind affordable workforce housing on Long Island right now,'' said Matthew T. Crosson, the association's president. The loss of younger residents, he said, is ''now cutting into the bone.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A companion measure sponsored by Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli, Democrat of Great Neck Plaza, passed unanimously earlier this month. The Senate bill, sponsored by Senator Michael A.L. Balboni of East Williston, is in committee but faces an uncertain future.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are broad concerns, and not just from people on Long Island, that the bill sets a precedent for eroding home rule,'' said Lisa Angerame, a spokeswoman for Mr. Balboni. ''We think the support for it is great, but we feel the discussions have to include everybody that is going to be affected.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Southold's town supervisor, Joshua Y. Horton, a member of the county commission, would go beyond the Senate bill. He has proposed that fully a quarter of all developments of five houses or more be affordable units.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in the United States fell 5.2 percent in January, as housing activity settled after reaching record levels in 2003, a report by the National Association of Realtors showed yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes slid to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.04 million units, from a revised 6.37 million rate in December, the real estate group said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Reuters had been expecting a 6.28 million unit rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing markets are healthy, very healthy, and all of these drop-offs are expected,'' said David Lereah, chief economist of the association. He added that some of the decline could be attributed to harsher-than-usual winter weather in the north.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes rose to a record 6.1 million in 2003 as mortgage interest rates hovered near lows not seen since the early 1960's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories shrank in January by 4.3 percent compared with the previous month, to a total of 2.2 million homes available for sale, or a 4.4 months' supply at the current sales pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median pre-owned home sales price jumped 5.4 percent from the same month a year ago, to $168,700.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing construction in January declined by the largest amount in nearly a year as bad winter weather played havoc with the plans of builders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the number of residential buildings under way dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.90 million units, representing a sharp 7.9 percent drop from 2.07 million units in December. The December pace was the strongest since February 1984.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of building permits, a sign of future activity, decreased 2.8 percent last month. Permits were up 6.9 percent from last year, however.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although economists were predicting a slowdown in January from the levels of December, last month's performance was weaker than the pace of around two million units that analysts had forecast. Still, even with the decline, the pace of residential construction in January was still fairly brisk, rising 4.1 percent from January 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 7.9 percent decline reported for overall housing construction in January was the steepest decline since February 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders say that February might turn out to be lackluster, too. Harsh winter weather in some parts of the country was partly to blame for builders expressing less optimism about sales prospects for February, according to a monthly survey by the National Association of Home Builders. The survey also found that builders are feeling less confident about sales prospects over the next six months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Cold weather had an impact on the U.S. housing market last month, although underlying activity may finally be simmering down from red-hot levels,'' said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market -- throughout the economic slump and the recovery -- has been the economy's shining star, providing a source of support for business growth. Economists predict that housing activity will be less of a contributor to growth this year but that the sector will stay healthy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales reached record high levels in 2003, powered by low mortgage rates. Sales of both existing homes and new ones should have their second best year ever in 2004 -- even with an expected rise in mortgage rates, economists said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year mortgage last week dipped to 5.66 percent. Some economists predict that the rate will rise to around 6.5 percent by the end of this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, housing construction in the Midwest plunged by 21 percent in January from December, to an annual rate of 319,000 units. In the Northeast, residential activity slowed to a pace of 148,000 units, a 14 percent drop from December's level. Housing starts in the South declined 5.2 percent in January, to a rate of 918,000 and in the West they dipped by 1 percent, to a pace of 518,000.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORTLANDT MANOR -- NATHANIEL GOLDBERG, 63, and his wife, Adrianna Goldberg, 36, began their search to buy a home with what they thought would be a big financial boost: a $25,000 down payment, an assistance grant from Community Housing Innovations, a nonprofit housing services agency based in White Plains and Patchogue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three months later, the Goldbergs, who rent a two-bedroom apartment in Cortlandt Manor for $1,100 a month, still couldn't find a place they could afford. The grant expired. ''We really went gung-ho looking, but the prices were just too outrageous,'' Mr. Goldberg said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families earning 60 to 80 percent of Westchester's median income qualify for up to $25,000 in grant money from Community Housing, which gets its money from the state. For a family of four, the maximum income would be $72,080. The grant offer expires in 60 days, with a 30-day extension available. Nearly half of the 60 grant certificates issued last year under Community Housing's Westchester Home Ownership Initiative did not result in a home purchase, said Regina Tindal, the agency's grants administrator.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community Housing's clients ''say how they've been trying and they can't find anything,'' she said. ''There's nothing we can do about the price of houses. That's why they can't find anything.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clients are facing a similar problem at Westchester Residential Opportunities, another nonprofit housing agency based in White Plains. This agency has a down payment assistance program that makes up to $25,000 available for families earning 50 to 60 percent of the county's median income and who buy homes in Westchester. Out of the approximately 20 families in the program last year, only one bought a house, said Toni Downs, the agency's executive director.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that her clients had run into a number of obstacles to homeownership. Some find a home, agree on a sale price, and then find that the bank says the house is worth less and they are only eligible for a loan for the lower amount. She said clients often can't afford the higher down payment to make up the difference.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are turned down by co-op boards, often without an explanation. ''Plus, you have the problem of someone with a $50,000 income.'' she said. ''How much of a mortgage can they afford?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goldberg, a jazz singer, and Mrs. Goldberg, a teacher's assistant, earn $45,000 a year. They had figured that with the $25,000 grant and $5,000 of their own savings, they could afford to take on a mortgage for a condominium or a cooperative costing from $90,000 to $95,000. They looked primarily in the artist-friendly Peekskill area. One $95,000 condo they liked sold before they could make an offer on it, Mr. Goldberg said. ''It's been difficult.'' he said. ''It's like batting your head against a wall.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Westchester's housing prices continue to climb, the number of homes on the market is shrinking. At the end of last year, 3,436 residential units were on sale, a 7 percent drop from 2002, according to a report issued by Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. The median sale price of a single-family home hit $564,000, up 7.4 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest increases, according to the report, were in the median prices of condominiums and co-ops, the most likely prospects for grant recipients. Median condominium prices rose 14.7 percent to $305,000, and median co-op prices rose 26.3 percent to 126,250. Inventory is particularly limited for condominiums, with only 334 on the market last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gilbert Mercurio, the president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors, said the situation was frustrating for many middle-income buyers. ''They have to limit themselves to the co-op market, which is not a suitable lifestyle for a lot of them,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tindal said she encouraged grant recipients to cope with the tight housing market by not limiting themselves geographically. She said distributing grant money successfully could be limited by clients' ''not being flexible in the things that they want in the home and the areas where they want to live.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another solution for housing agencies is to combine grants. At Community Housing, eight families who qualified for both a $25,000 home rehabilitation grant and a $20,000 down payment assistance grant were able to close on homes, Ms. Tindal said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alfredo Chevres, 31, used the combined grant package to purchase a four-bedroom house in Yonkers for $255,000. The renovation money paid for a new roof, boiler, and upstairs bathroom. ''I was really lucky,'' he said. ''Everything else in the area was $300,000 and up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Downs said Westchester Residential Opportunities was in partnership with the Yonkers-based Housing Action Council and together identify more families who may be eligible for down payment assistance. The agency also may raise the maximum income requirement in its next grant application cycle to include families at 60 to 80 percent of the county's median income.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are not giving up,'' she said. ''We're hoping that we're going to be able to get this down payment money to families.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander Roberts, executive director of Community Housing Innovations, said larger grant amounts would help more people buy homes. ''But the question becomes, is this the most efficient use of taxpayer subsidies to generate affordable housing?'' he said. ''I personally believe we need more affordable housing and we need communities to allow more affordable housing to be built.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community Housing Innovations receives about a million dollars a year to finance its down payment assistance programs from two New York State agencies: the Division of Housing and Community Renewal and the Affordable Housing Corporation, run by the State Housing Finance Agency. Michael Wadman, the senior vice president of housing programs and policy for the New York State Housing Finance Agency, said the cap on individual grant amounts was set in 1985 and is written into state law. The agency is willing to extend deadlines for using grant money to up to a year, he said.The payoff for the extra effort to get grant money spent is the reward of putting homeowners on the path to long-term economic stability, Ms. Downs said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But it's really hard to develop that asset of homeownership in this county,'' she said.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">In Counting Square Feet, Elastic Rules  </span>
</div><div class="author">By JAY ROMANO  </div><div>1090 words</div><div>15 February 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>5</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT is an indisputable fact that one foot equals 12 inches and also that a square foot has 144 inches. It is less certain what the term square foot means when it is used to describe the size of a co-op, a condo or even a house in suburbia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buyers seem to be increasingly interested in square footage these days,'' said Frederick W. Peters, president of Warburg Realty Partnership in Manhattan. ''And when you're talking about New York real estate, square footage is a moving target.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Mr. Peters said, in a co-op, the square footage of an apartment typically includes the floor space within the perimeter walls of the apartment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even that seemingly straightforward measurement, however, can vary. ''It doesn't work to just measure the rooms and then add all the measurements together,'' he said. Doing that, he explained, would miss the space in closets and small corridors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, he said, just measuring the perimeter walls will include ''dead space'' within the apartment -- like the floor space taken up by interior walls.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out, however, that including such space is the most common way of calculating the square footage of a co-op apartment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Peters noted that it is important to use measurement methods that accurately compare one apartment with similarly sized apartments. ''At the end of the day, what I'm concerned about most is not the exact accuracy of the numbers,'' he said, ''but that I am comparing apples to apples.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even that, however, may be difficult when dealing with condominium apartments. Condo measurements are reached differently from co-op measurements, and there are even variations in the way that condominiums in different buildings are measured, depending in large part on when the condominium was organized.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alvin Schein, a Manhattan lawyer who represents condominium conversion sponsors and developers, said condominiums converted in the early 1980's and before used a different technique from condominiums converted or constructed in the past 15 or 20 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we started doing conversions back in the early 80's, the method for computing square footage of a condo came pretty close to describing the usable square footage in the apartment,'' he said. And the method used by most condos would basically describe the same amount of physical space as the measurement used for co-ops. In other words, back then a 1,200-square-foot condo would have the same amount of usable space as a 1,200-square-foot co-op.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things are different today, however. ''Somewhere in the mid- to late 80's, someone came up with a way to expand the measurement of a condominium,'' Mr. Schein said. ''Instead of measuring from the inside surface of the walls, they started measuring from the outside face of the walls.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While that might not at first appear to add significantly to the overall area of an apartment, Mr. Schein said, the additional square footage captured by this method could be significant because of the way some buildings are constructed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In some buildings, the exterior walls are 18 inches thick,'' he said, noting that the additional foot and a half could add a significant number of square feet to the final calculation. And that increase would be even greater for corner apartments, which have two exterior walls to account for.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Mr. Schein said, if a corner apartment was 20 feet wide by 40 feet long, and the exterior wall was 18 inches thick, the exterior walls alone would add more than 90 square feet to the apartment's area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sponsors and developers generally disclose the method used to calculate the square footage of a condominium apartment, the result often produces confusion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''First of all, it creates a bit of a distortion because you're including common elements in the measurement of the apartment,'' Mr. Schein said. And second, he said, because the method used has changed over the years, comparing condominium apartments in different buildings may not necessarily be comparing apples with apples. And the distortion can be even greater with larger apartments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Peters, the realtor, said that in some cases when he has taken his own measurements of ''full floor'' condominiums -- and some condos in buildings where there are just a few apartments on a floor -- his result is significantly different from the one specified by the developer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I've done square footage calculations on my own, my number comes up being about 80 percent of what the developer came up with,'' he said. ''And the only way I can get up to the developer's number is by adding in some part of the corridors or stairwells.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar confusion about measurement also occurs with houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sellers naturally want to make their properties seem as big as possible,'' said Peter Bell, a broker with Balch Buyers Realty in Mamaroneck. ''And not many buyers will actually take out a tape measure and check the seller's measurements.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confusion also arises when buyers are trying to compare the square footage of different style houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, he said, when measuring a typical colonial home, an appraiser would generally take measurements around the exterior of the house for each floor that is above grade. So, for example, the measurement of a two-story colonial with a basement and an attic would generally include only the square footage of the first and second floor. And while a finished attic that is used as living space might be included in the square footage calculation, a finished basement typically would not.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things get more dicey when the house being measured is a raised ranch or a bilevel. With such houses, Mr. Bell said, the basement is often partially above grade. As a result, some sellers and listing agents will include the basement in the total square footage calculations.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What that means is that when you're trying to compare a raised ranch or bilevel to a colonial, you may be comparing apples to oranges,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gil Neary, president of DG Neary Realty in Manhattan, said that when the size of a house or apartment is an issue -- as it often is in New York -- he generally encourages clients to take measurements of their own.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Square footage is one of the most misrepresented numbers in real estate,'' Mr. Neary said. ''It almost seems as though everybody uses a different sized ruler.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island, where post-World War II suburbia was born, is in a midlife crisis and battling some disturbing social and economic trends that provide a window into issues that suburbs around the nation may face, according to a 15-month study sponsored by a nonprofit group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average pay from Long Island employers has dropped in recent years, little land is left to develop, taxes are high, cars are multiplying faster than people, commuting times are longer and people are being priced out of the housing market, the report said. And an increasing minority population is coinciding with persistent segregation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps most striking is that a region long synonymous with families and children is losing part of its younger generation, and the median age of residents is steadily rising. In the 1990's, the number of people age 18 to 34 shrank by 143,184, or 20 percent, in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, the census showed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That age group also declined nationwide, reflecting the ''baby bust'' that followed the baby boom. But the island's drop was five times the national decrease of 4 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, titled Long Island Index 2004: Coming Together for Long Island's Future, analyzes the region's strengths and problems and sets goals for improvement. The Rauch Foundation of Garden City sponsored the study in a joint project with an array of government, civic, business and labor groups. Similar efforts are under way in Boston, Chicago and Silicon Valley.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island, where Levittown sprang from potato fields as an instant community, is now ''the nation's first mature suburb,'' the report said. ''Long Island is a case study in how do we reinvent the suburbs,'' said the study's director, Carrie Meek Gallagher. ''Anecdotally, similar dynamics are happening in housing, the economy and transportation around Boston. It's almost post-suburbia. What do we do now?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foundation's president, Dr. Nancy Rauch Douzinas, said, ''We're hoping this will be a real tool for action.'' County Executives Thomas R. Suozzi of Nassau and Steve Levy of Suffolk are to speak at the report's presentation today.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 2.8 million people -- more than the populations in 19 states -- 1 million jobs and a $112 billion annual economy, Long Island remains a premier suburb. Its assets include highly rated schools, health care, parks, beaches and shopping and an educated work force, high employment, low crime and access to New York City.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report found ''a growing disparity by income, race and ethnicity that is clear in current housing, educational and health indicators.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study called the ''brain drain'' on the island alarming. ''The region is exporting its most valuable product -- its talented young people,'' the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey of young adults found that 53 percent were considering moving out, citing the high cost of living, especially soaring housing prices and burdensome taxes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the young have left and Levittown-era pioneers have lingered into retirement, the island's median age has steadily risen. Now 29 percent of the population is older than 50.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sizzling real estate market may be a bonanza for sellers, but a third of Long Islanders spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999 the median home price was about 2.5 times the median annual income. By last year, the median price had jumped to four times the median income in Suffolk and nearly 4.5 in Nassau.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the median home price, at $363,700, is comparable to those in other New York suburbs, the report said the scarcity of apartments resulted in ''some of the highest rents in the metropolitan region.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for new housing, government and developers will have to be inventive because ''there is very little undeveloped land left on Long Island that is not protected parkland,'' the report said. About 70 percent of the island is developed -- nearly 90 percent in Nassau. By contrast, the report said that suburbs north of the city and in northern New Jersey are about 40 percent developed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the fabled luxury of the Gold Coast and the elite Hamptons, the report said that 154,000 Long Islanders, or 5.5 percent, live below the poverty line, and many others are coping with dwindling income.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1990 to 2003, the island lost 29,000 technology manufacturing jobs as most of the remaining aerospace industry -- once the local economic engine -- vanished. Still, there was a net gain of 80,500 jobs, led by an expansion of 34,000 jobs in health care.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The catch was that the new jobs generally paid less. Average pay on Long Island peaked in 2000 at $42,875, and during the recession, it gradually slipped 6 percent to $40,329 last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Long Island paycheck premium is also shrinking, the report said. In 1993 Long Island workers earned an average of $39,385 a year, compared with the national average of $34,272, a difference of $5,113, or about 15 percent. Last year the local average was $40,329, while the national average was $38,636, a difference of only about 5 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demographics are taking on new hues. The number of nonwhite residents increased from 16 percent of the population in 1990 to 24 percent in 2000. Hispanics are now the largest minority, making up 10 percent of the population, up from 6 percent in 1990. Next are blacks at 8 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the races mostly remain in separate neighborhoods. ''Long Island is one of the most racially segregated suburban regions in the nation,'' the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immigrants are changing the island, where 196,255 of them moved between 1995 and 2002, the study said. Domestic migration in those years was led by 122,000 people from Queens and Brooklyn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mass transportation is limited, and, as any local resident can attest, traffic is fierce. Ninety-four percent of households have at least one car; two-thirds have two or more. ''From 1980 to 2000, the number of motor vehicles grew by 19 percent, more than three times the rate of population growth,'' the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commutes are longer, too. In the 1990's, the number of workers commuting less than 30 minutes to work declined by nearly 50,000, the census showed. The number of people with longer commutes increased, especially those whose commutes took more than 90 minutes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government that oversees Long Island is large, cumbersome and costly, the report found. ''Jurisdictional fragmentation'' characterizes the hodgepodge of two counties, 13 towns, two cities, 95 villages, 128 school systems and hundreds of other special districts for libraries, fire departments and other services, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together those governments employ 195,000 workers, more than any industry. Their workers' average pay is a fifth higher than the national average for government workers, a cost born by local taxpayers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Long Island is at a tipping point, facing serious challenges,'' Dr. Douzinas said, adding that she was optimistic that solutions would be found.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DEVELOPERS would be allowed higher housing densities in return for inclusion of some homes affordable to buyers with incomes below the region's median under a plan being advocated by Long Island builders. Their proposals, in a 13-page report being circulated by the Long Island Builders Institute, also include areas zoned for housing for entry-level workers, first-time home buyers and the elderly that would have a mix of studio and one-bedroom apartments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not talking about paving over Long Island,'' said Robert Wieboldt, executive vice president of the 650-member Islandia-based trade organization. ''Affordable housing can be done attractively, clustered on smaller parcels of land that use fewer roads and provide more open space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we can get the density, we can get the affordable housing,'' he said. ''If we don't do it, it leaves us with just building luxury houses. Some towns are upzoning from one to two acres; some have five-acre zoning. This uses the land up twice as fast, and the houses are affordable only for those building million dollar houses.'' This places tight restrictions on the number of homes that builders are currently allowed to build.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solution, according to the builders' plan, is for municipalities to permit a developer to increase the density of a parcel in return for setting aside a percentage of the homes at prices that would be affordable for families whose income is below the region's median; establish special ''work force-senior zoning districts'' with a mix of one-bedroom and studio apartments; provide property tax abatements for first-time home buyers; and redevelop strip shopping centers with multiunit housing that in some cases could be four stories high, as allowed by the new state building code. The proposal, ''Homebuilders' Blueprint for Producing More Reasonably Priced Homes,'' would apply only to developments with housing units selling for less than $500,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builders' plan will be publicized through a campaign costing more than $300,000 to be presented to municipalities and community groups, Mr. Wieboldt said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builders will also be lobbying state officials to pass legislation introduced by Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli, a Democrat from Great Neck, and Senator Michael A. L. Balboni, a Republican from East Williston. This measure would require municipalities to create ordinances to provide developers of projects of five units or more with extra density in exchange for selling a minimum of 10 percent affordable homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Morgo, president of the Hauppauge-based Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit group that builds and promotes affordable housing, said: ''Including a percentage of a development for people otherwise unable to buy a home works all over the country and is already being done in Huntington and Islip.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By creating more density, you incentivize the builders to build affordable housing. We will be seeing more of this in the future now that the builders are in on this wave because we're losing our young people to the high cost of houses.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ACCORDING to Thomas Datre, an owner of Datre Custom Builders in Ronkonkoma, the changes proposed would not be a windfall for builders. ''The money is relative to the investment, and it equals out,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the proposal notes, a 3,000-square-foot house on a one-acre parcel acquired for $150,000 would typically cost $600,000. But if four 2,300-square-foot units were built on that acre, the homes would be priced at $160,000 each and yield a similar profit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, there are more than 250,000 people paying more than 30 percent of their gross income to live on Long Island, Mr. Morgo said. According to federal guidelines, homeowners or renters should not pay more than 35 percent of their income for housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past five years, Long Island housing prices have risen 81 percent while household incomes have risen only 14 percent, said Pearl Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, a Commack-based business group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, Long Island's civilian labor force totaled 1.5 million people, with a median income of $66,400 for a family of two and $83,000 for a family of four.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the median selling price for a house in Nassau was $400,000, a 12 percent increase over last year at the same time. In Suffolk the price was $325,000, a 16 percent increase, Dr. Kamer said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A family buying a median-priced home in Nassau with taxes of about $8,000 would need an annual income of almost $97,000 to avoid paying more than 35 percent of income. (This assumes a down payment of 10 percent and a 30-year mortgage charging an interest rate of 6 percent.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the builders say they are expecting some resistance to their plan, including from school districts that are near capacity, at least one superintendent said he would be attracted to the plan if it contained the elements of ''smart growth,'' the community-planning movement that is geared to retaining open space while allowing for population growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Hawkins, superintendent of the William Floyd School District -- which covers the communities of Mastic Beach, Shirley and Moriches, and has a total enrollment of 11,000 students -- said he had not seen the builders' proposal, but is a proponent of smart growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Typically from a school district's perspective, if anyone is planning high density with school children it would react negatively and certainly would not approve tax abatements,'' he said. ''But it would be encouraging to districts if the developers are adhering to smart growth principles of interspersing mixed use so there wouldn't be a deficit in terms of a tax base from the residential side.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Wieboldt, the builders will be asking for state assistance for heavily impacted school districts, which have additional costs associated with the production of affordable homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RESISTANCE could also come from some of Long Island's 95 incorporated villages; many restrict one house to a lot of more than one acre.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other villages, like Patchogue, a 2.3-square-mile area with about 11,000 residents, there is not enough land left for new housing, said Val Biscardi, executive director of Patchogue's community development agency. While the village cannot participate ''on a grand scale such as that proposed by the builders, we do what we can for such a small area,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last four years, the village has renovated four homes and sold them at below market prices to first-time home buyers and those with low incomes, she said. The houses, which had been taken by Suffolk for back taxes, were sold to the village for less than $1,000 each.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farther west in Melville, the Babylon-based McGovern-Barbash Associates has begun construction on Villages West, a 258-unit development where 60 units are limited to first-time home buyers whose total family income is less than $66,400.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project is to have single-family houses, attached four-unit town houses and semidetached units. The affordable units, which will be sold through a lottery, will be scattered throughout the community. They are to sell for $140,000; similar units would sell at a market rate of $335,000 to $360,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar development, the 248-unit Villages at Huntington, also with 60 affordable units, was built five years ago by Barbash Associates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that is a formula that works,'' said Susan Barbash, an owner. ''I admit there are some people who won't buy into a development if it has an affordable component, but that's a small percentage.'' For example, she said, ''Some of the homes at the Villages at Huntington started at $300,000 and are now reselling at $800,000.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawmakers, too, say they have begun seriously addressing the affordable housing issue. In January, Suffolk's new county executive, Steve Levy, a Democrat from Holbrook, said in his inaugural address that he would be establishing a commission on affordable housing that would include builders and local officials.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to identify predeveloped buildings that could be rejuvenated into affordable housing,'' Mr. Levy said in a telephone interview. ''The county would purchase the property, then flip it back to the developer. We would get agreements from the town for preapproval for housing plans, then strike an agreement with the developer on the property once they have their permits. For example, if a developer proposes to cluster a development with 25 percent used for affordable housing, then the developer will know he has an investment.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States Representative Steve Israel, a Democrat from Huntington, said he would be introducing a bill in February that would provide federal financing to ''defense oriented'' communities to help provide affordable housing for their work forces.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new legislation would target those communities where there are companies receiving production contracts worth at least $5 million from the Department of Defense or the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Israel said. There are a number of communities on Long Island, including Bethpage and Deer Park, with military contractors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The average defense worker on Long Island can make $70,000 a year, but that doesn't qualify you for a home on Long Island,'' Mr. Israel said.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By JOSH BARBANEL  </div><div>1589 words</div><div>30 January 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the construction of luxury apartment buildings in Manhattan has commanded far more attention, new census data show that New York City is in the midst of a more surprising housing boom that extends across much of Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, including neighborhoods where developers once feared to tread without large government subsidies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of permits for new housing units in the city rose last year to the highest level in 30 years, while the total was stable or fell across the rest of the metropolitan area. City planners say those figures, released this week by the Census Bureau, document a new wave of interest and investment in middle-class neighborhoods outside Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been decades since developers showed much appetite for building private, unsubsidized middle-income housing in the city, largely because it was so hard to turn a profit. Now, though, the construction boom stretches from the South Bronx, where a surge in privately financed development has led to a tripling of land prices, to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, where houses are being torn down and replaced by six- and seven-story rental buildings and condominiums for an influx of recent immigrants, prompting calls for new zoning restrictions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is market-driven, and the market is clearly making a vote of confidence in the city as a place to invest,'' said Eric Kober, director of housing, economic and infrastructure planning at the City Planning Department. ''We call it reverse urban sprawl.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new-home permits issued by the city has been rising strongly since the late 1990's, and still lags way behind the rising demand for housing as the city's population grows. The census figures are striking: Last year, builders obtained permits for 21,218 new privately owned apartments and houses, more than in any year since 1973, though far fewer than during the construction boom of the early 1960's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new homes approved rose by 15 percent from the year before, even though the number in Manhattan fell slightly for the second year in a row. In the last five years, the greatest increases both in numbers and percentages have occurred in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers and planners say the trend is driven by several forces, like increased demand, lower crime rates and better-kept neighborhoods. Low interest rates have cut building costs and have expanded the pool of people who can afford homes enough to include recent immigrants.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the new development outside Manhattan has involved smaller projects: one- and two-family houses and small apartment buildings that can be built more cheaply than steel-trussed Manhattan high-rises, in part because they often use less expensive nonunion labor. Some builders are immigrants who have recently made the transition from contractors to developers, according to builders and planners.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased development in the city is taking place as new home construction in the rest of the metropolitan area -- which includes portions of New Jersey, Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania -- is stable or falling slightly, despite rising home prices and the lowest interest rates in a generation. Throughout the region, the number of jobs has grown faster than new homes have been built, leading planners to worry that a housing shortage could hurt economic growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Census Bureau figures, the total of new home construction in 2000 through 2003 rose 77 percent in New York City over the previous four years, while it increased by 2.4 percent in the rest of the metropolitan area. The city's share of new-home permits rose to 32 percent from 21 percent. Outside the city, the number of new homes approved last year -- 37,180 -- was slightly lower than in the year before, and remained 15 percent below the peak year of 2000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, an independent planning group, said the permits data reflected two trends. Many outer suburbs are ''pulling up the drawbridge'' out of concern for overburdened schools and services, he said, and rezoning to require larger lots or converting residential lots for commercial and industrial development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, he said, Manhattan ''has run out of neighborhoods below 110th Street to revitalize.'' So development has spread beyond there and the brownstone neighborhoods of Brooklyn, to other Brooklyn neighborhoods, Queens and even the Bronx, which has long lagged behind the rest of the city economically. With housing prices in the suburbs climbing ever higher, many families looking to buy their first home are staying in the city.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Bronx is becoming once again what it was for most of the 20th century, a center for middle-class families and working families with kids,'' Mr. Yaro said. ''It's got good bones -- good parks and good transit.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development could slow, however, if interest rates rise sharply, land prices jump or denser housing leads to widespread zoning restrictions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua D. Weissman, the treasurer of the Jackson Development Group, has watched the boom but sees some risks ahead. Last year, his company completed 70 homes on 15 sites, typically in two- and three-family houses on vacant lots in the South Bronx, which are being marketed at about $450,000 per house, and is planning to build and sell 100 more units this year. The houses were built without special government subsidies or land provided by the city, something that was unthinkable just a few years ago, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had one lot on 180th Street and Hughes Avenue,'' he said, ''a corner lot full of cars and tires and garbage. It was terrible. We went in there and built four houses, and two houses over another company was building as well.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the vacant lots the company has relied on, which are often illegal parking lots on the sites of buildings burned out and torn down during the decline of the South Bronx, were getting harder to find because prices have tripled since 1999. The nationwide housing boom has raised the prices of construction supplies like plywood and metal studs; the cost of wood flooring has risen 20 percent, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development in Manhattan declined only slightly last year, according to the census figures, as the number of new homes approved fell by 175 from a year earlier, to about 17 percent below the peak of 6,109 in 2001, although real estate industry officials note that those numbers excluded projects in which downtown office buildings are being converted to housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1985 to 2001, there were more than two Manhattan homes approved for every home approved in Brooklyn, the city's most populous borough. Last year, though, there were more new homes approved in Brooklyn than in Manhattan, 6,054 to 5,232.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">R. Randy Lee, a developer and chairman of the Building Industry Association of New York, said low interest rates were driving the resurgence of construction for the middle class. In the early 1990's, he said, he built subsidized houses in the Bronx that were affordable to families earning $30,000 to $40,000 a year, but as costs rose, minimum incomes rose to as much as $75,000 or $80,000. But as interest rates have fallen in the last few years, reducing monthly mortgage payments, minimum incomes have fallen again to where they were in the early 1990's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As the immigrant population continues to expand, there are a lot of first-generation immigrant buyers,'' he said. ''People who have green cards and jobs are strong buyers for homes.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many developers attribute the resurgence to city housing programs, which have provided subsidies and city-owned land and buildings for renovation and new construction of housing. But as the city develops plans for its last remaining properties, the number of new apartments and projects begun has started to decline, and the momentum has shifted to private developers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Their ability to lead the market has diminished,'' Mr. Lee said of city housing programs. ''But by giving those neighborhoods a kick-start, they created an atmosphere where private sites could be developed.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contributing to the boom is a rising city population, which grew by 900,000 between 1980 and 2000, and an additional 84,000 through July 2002, according to census data. Mr. Kober said city demographers believe that the population has continued to rise since then, in part because of continued immigration.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, unlike many suburban communities, New York City has a large reserve of unused building rights, since, under a 1961 zoning resolution, many neighborhoods outside Manhattan are zoned for far denser development than the single-family homes already there.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 -- Sales of previously owned homes set a record in 2003 as the lowest mortgage rates in decades proved too good for many buyers to pass up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported on Monday that existing-home sales totaled 6.1 million last year, passing the previous record of 5.57 million set in 2002. Last year's sales represented a 9.6 percent increase from the 2002 level.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report provided vivid evidence of the strength of the housing market, which played an important role in keeping the economy going throughout last year. In December, existing-home sales jumped 6.9 percent from the month before, ending the year on a high note.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for all of 2003 was 5.83 percent, the lowest annual average since Freddie Mac began tracking interest rates in 1971. A slowdown in sales is based in part on an expectation that mortgage rates will drift higher later this year as the economy continues to gain momentum.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, the median price of an existing home was $169,900, up 7.5 percent from the median price of $158,100 in 2002. The median price is the midpoint -- where half sell for more and half sell for less. Last year's increase in home price appreciation was the largest since 1980, when the median price rose by 11.7 percent.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the Editor:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The observations made by James W. Hughes and Joseph J. Seneca (Soapbox, Jan. 18) about the affordability of housing seem to take it as a given that the state will need to find a way to make housing more affordable for large numbers of people who would otherwise not be able to find housing or afford housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that New Jersey is already the most densely populated state, where is it written that we must accommodate unlimited inflows of new residents and use direct or indirect public subsidy to guarantee a continuing supply of affordable housing?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability varies greatly around the state. Legislative and judicial efforts to manage availability and affordability have often have been hijacked to serve the interests of developers and not communities. As result, I have serious concerns about the state's managing this marketplace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of even greater concern is the notion that the population needs to keep expanding. Is there a point where, as in an ecosystem, we are full? Sure, we can pave the state over with concrete and high-rise apartments, but is that what we want? Manhattan West? Messrs. Hughes and Seneca should address the natural limits of population growth in a region like New Jersey. Common sense suggests that we may need to accept some limits.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By JENNIFER BAYOT   </div><div>1074 words</div><div>22 January 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market may not be done driving the economy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said yesterday that construction began on a larger-than-expected number of homes in December, capping the best year for new housing in a quarter of a century and leading some industry analysts to raise their housing forecasts for 2004.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Month after month, we've expected total housing starts to moderate a bit, but it doesn't seem to have happened,'' said Orawin T. Velz, a senior economist at Fannie Mae, the nation's largest buyer of home mortgages. ''With this rate in December, the decline in 2004 may not be much at all.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That bodes well for an economy that has been relying on the building, buying and refinancing of homes even as companies cut workers and production.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all of 2003, builders broke ground on 1.85 million homes, an 8.4 percent increase over 2002 and the best year for home building since 1978. That year, total housing starts, which include both single-family and multifamily homes, were 2.02 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in December reached an annual rate of 2.09 million, the fastest rate since the 2.26 million annual pace in February 1984. December's new-construction figure represents an increase of 1.7 percent over November's figure and a rise of 15 percent over that for December 2002.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Bloomberg News had predicted that housing starts would fall 5.8 percent to an annual rate of 1.9 million in December from November. Economists said that while housing numbers could be erratic and were often revised, the data released yesterday may mean that 2004 will be a stronger year than had been expected, and may seem strong even compared with the last three years of extraordinary refinancing and home-buying activity.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Combined with the unexpectedly low mortgage rates, this suggests that we may have been too conservative in our assessment of 2004,'' said Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. On Monday, the association had forecast that single-family housing starts would drop about 3 percent in 2004, to 1.45 million homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the annual rate of new construction of single-family homes fell a modest 0.6 percent from November to December.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The report is still consistent with a very slight slowing in housing,'' said David Lereah, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors in Washington. But single-family housing starts for the year were at their highest since 1977. Multifamily housing starts were up for both the month and the year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, applications for building permits rose 3.3 percent in December, to an annual rate of 1.92 million, from 1.86 million in November, suggesting that builders will be busy meeting demand through at least January and February, economists said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carliner added that other businesses would benefit as well. ''It's going to mean additional demand for mortgages, real estate services, furniture and all types of things,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And housing with permits requested before December could still be awaiting construction. Permits were requested for 1.86 million homes last year, 6.3 percent more than in 2002.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More important, analysts said, is that home buyers are seeing the lowest interest rates on home loans since June, when rates reached a 41-year low, according to HSH Associates, a mortgage research concern in Pompton Plains, N.J. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the industry benchmark, is now 5.74 percent, HSH said. Just a month ago, the rate exceeded 6 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, more and more analysts are predicting that slow-growing employment numbers and other economic data will persuade the Federal Reserve to keep its key short-term rate at 1 percent, not only when it meets next week but also for most of the year and even into 2005.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think increasingly it looks like 2004 could be better than 2003,'' Mr. Carliner said. ''We certainly didn't expect to have mortgages available at 5.7 percent in January.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people do seem to still be buying. The Mortgage Bankers Association said yesterday that its index of purchases rose 12.5 percent from the previous week.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors also seemed to believe that yesterday's housing numbers would mean better results for this year. The Standard &amp; Poor's supercomposite thrifts and mortgage finance index closed up 2.6 percent yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some economists worried that a substantial part of the home building is speculative and could create an excess of homes, eventually leading to a decline in housing prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I look at this rate of building, and to me it's just crazy,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a Washington research group. ''Homes are being built in a way that is inconsistent with any plausible growth in demand.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists found it troubling that the increase in housing starts last month was largely a result of the rise in construction starts of multifamily homes while starts of single-family homes declined, albeit slightly. In general, apartment vacancies are high and rent prices are low, they said, so why build potential rental units?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carliner of the National Association of Home Builders said the increase seemed to be in areas where rental units would most be needed. For instance, he noted that much of the growth in multifamily housing was in the Northeast, presumably in metropolitan areas, where demand remains strong.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By JAMES W. HUGHES and JOSEPH J. SENECA  </div><div>819 words</div><div>18 January 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>15</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS prices soar and affordability plummets, new housing appears to be falling out of the reach of many New Jersey households.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our recent report on home-price bubbles disclosed big increases in the state's shelter prices. From 1998 to 2003, house prices grew by 51.7 percent in New Jersey. While we concluded that this increase had not created an unsustainable bubble, it does represent a major price spike far in excess of income growth and inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, one culprit is the increasing difficulty of building on the state's remaining greenfields, a result of growing efforts to preserve open space and increasing development constraints on the metropolitan edge. Smart-growth public policies aimed at reining in sprawl are likely to intensify and further constrain greenfield housing production. This will contribute to additional home price increases and declines in housing affordability. As mortgage rates move up from 40-year lows, shelter that is reasonably priced will be further reduced.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a neglected upside to the affordability problem that is generating public and private benefits and creating both a need and an opportunity to address the high costs of housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A drive through any of New Jersey's older post-1950 tract-house suburbs shows considerable evidence of an upsurge in revitalization and reinvestment. This is occurring in many areas that a decade or two ago appeared to be increasingly shopworn places that households were rapidly trading up and away from. But spiraling new home prices have increased the demand for, and the prices of, the existing housing supply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the price of trading up to new housing soars, existing homeowners experience a private windfall. They find the value of their homes increasing significantly. This gain provides homeowners with the economic incentive to reinvest and remodel and to remain in their community with significant public benefits for the municipality. Over the last five years, this process has intensified and is now a visible part of the state's housing landscape.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, new vitality is increasingly evident in new construction or rehabilitated housing in most of our more urbanized areas along with declining retail vacancies and the arrival of national retail chains. The rediscovery and resurgence of many older developed parts of the state that once appeared destined for a troubled future is a direct consequence of declining housing affordability and increasing anti-sprawl constraints on new housing production, as well as new demand stemming from substantial immigration.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than 50 years, the state was engulfed by a tidal wave of metropolitan expansion, with new development constantly pushing ever outward. In the 1950's and 1960's, for example, families moved into Levittown-style dwellings -- 900-square-foot tributes to modesty -- at a rate of 1,000 a week for more than 1,000 consecutive weeks. This yielded a million new housing units over 20 years, overwhelming such in-lying counties as Bergen, Essex and Union.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequently, it was the state's ever-expanding periphery where the newest and, with the exception of our older elite communities, most desirable housing proliferated. This process relentlessly drew the upwardly mobile from older in-lying suburbs and cities. Massive housing production on the ever-expanding metropolitan edge resulted in affordable homes and opportunities for new households, particularly immigrants, to acquire a first home by a filtering process that increased the availability of units at the bottom of the housing ladder first in urban areas and then in older suburbs. But this developmental process came with significant environmental and congestion costs, the loss of millions of acres of forest and farmland and deteriorating left-behind areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are in the process of achieving the smart-growth planners' holy grail; namely, constraining sprawl and directing increased private reinvestment into older developed areas. But the old adage to be careful what you wish for has again come home to roost in the form of substantial decreases in housing affordability. We no longer can achieve, as we did for a half of a century, continued housing affordability by sustained large-scale housing production on an ever-receding undeveloped regional periphery. Direct public investment will be required to ensure housing opportunity and affordability in the future.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where will such financial resources come from at a time of widespread fiscal constraint? Two sectors should be explored: significant resource (or tax) savings are being achieved by not having to develop infrastructure and service systems on the periphery, and new resources (taxable value) are being created when older areas are revitalized. Affordable housing needs should have some claim on both of these resource and tax benefits stemming from our new growth patterns.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last eight years, housing prices have risen 35 percentage points more than the rate of inflation, on average. Such figures are prompting talk about whether the housing market is in a bubble like the one that inflated stock prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New England, housing prices rose 59.6 percentage points above inflation from 1995 to 2003, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. (Its data may even understate the increase because they exclude housing with mortgages of $320,000 or more.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in some expensive housing markets, including San Francisco and Seattle, rental prices are now falling, which may be a sign of weak demand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Center for Economic and Policy Research, a nonprofit group in Washington, has been sounding warnings about a housing bubble. But it wants to know what other people think, so it is holding an essay contest. A $1,000 prize will go to the person who, in 750 words or less, makes the best case that there is no housing bubble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In announcing the contest, the center said that ''it took nothing more than simple arithmetic to recognize the existence of the stock market bubble'' in 1998 to 2000, because stock prices were rising far faster than corporate profits or dividends.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who say there is no housing bubble have argued that housing prices are up because of immigration, limited supplies of urban land, environmental rules that limit construction and the rising incomes of buyers. The center's economists say that they do not believe that, but that they want to see if anyone can persuade them otherwise.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR around $470,000, recent listings show, you could buy a four-bedroom, four-bathroom traditional house in Dallas with granite kitchen countertops and vaulted living room ceilings. In Columbus, Ohio, you could buy a sprawling four-bedroom house with two fireplaces, a whirlpool and a ravine outside your front door.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or you could buy a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers paid an average of $469,960 in the final quarter of 2003 for one-bedroom apartments in Manhattan below 96th Street on the East Side and below 112th Street on the West Side, according to the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Overview, one of the most comprehensive surveys of the real estate market in that area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite such high prices, demand heated up: though two-bedrooms still represented the highest proportion of sales -- 43 percent -- one-bedrooms grew from 32 percent of all sales in the last quarter of 2002 to 39 percent in 2003, according to Miller Samuel Inc., the real estate appraisal company that compiles the report.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of one-bedroom co-ops vaulted, to an average of $444,373, up 7.2 percent from the previous quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's just not enough inventory out there,'' said Sheila Lokitz, an agent with the Corcoran Group in Manhattan. ''And what comes on just absolutely flies off the market.'' Condos, a much smaller part of the one-bedroom market, fell to $536,634, from $574,580 in the third quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers could take some relief from the fact that the average price of all co-ops and condos -- a measure strongly affected by extremes at either the high or the low end -- was down 1.5 percent, to $903,259, compared with $916,959 in the previous quarter. But the third-quarter figure was inflated by the record-setting $45 million sale of a penthouse at the Time Warner Center.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basically, said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, ''all the indicators are up,'' as low interest rates, a rebound on Wall Street and a growth of confidence in the economy prompted more New Yorkers to pour money into a dwindling supply of apartments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of apartments on the market dropped 7.3 percent, to 4,843 at the end of the fourth quarter, from 5,224 at the end of the third -- the first time in seven quarters that inventories fell below 5,000. ''All of our brokers are scrounging around and fighting over the same number of listings,'' said Steven James, director of sales at Douglas Elliman, one of the city's largest brokerage firms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his firm's chief rivals, Corcoran, will also release figures today, showing that the average price of condos and co-ops rose nearly 9 percent, to $854,000 in the fourth quarter, compared with $784,000 the quarter before. Corcoran's figures cover Manhattan sales below West 125th Street and East 96th Street.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the story of the year was coulda, shoulda, woulda,'' said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group. ''If you didn't buy in the first half of the year, you spent a lot more money in the second half for the same type of apartment.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers of one-bedroom co-ops certainly were learning that lesson all year. With mortgage rates low, the monthly cost of buying an apartment was often close to the cost of renting one, or even lower, even though rents dropped by nearly 30 percent, said Neil Binder, a principal at the Bellmarc Companies, a real estate firm in Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Based on the monthly carrying costs, for the one-bedroom buyer it became a very exciting alternative,'' Mr. Binder said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, toward the end of the year, apartment buyers started to panic at the prospect that interest rates might increase or that the improving economy would draw out even more buyers. As a result, bidding wars were common, and those who hesitated or made lowball offers suddenly found themselves priced out of the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For sellers, who just a few years ago were worrying that one-bedrooms were not a good investment, the buying boom has turned into a boon. In September, when MaryJo Palumbo, an agent at Douglas Elliman, took on a listing for a one-bedroom co-op apartment in Chelsea, she advised the seller to price it at $399,000. But the seller decided to ask $425,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, offers trickled in: $385,000, $395,000, $400,000. The seller turned them all down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in the first week of December, Ms. Palumbo said, four buyers offered the asking price, and one raised it by $11,000. The seller accepted an offer at the asking price, Ms. Palumbo said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People who have been on the fence about buying one-bedrooms are looking at the economy improving and believe that prices and interest rates are going to go up this spring,'' Ms. Palumbo said. ''So they're buying right this second, before anything happens.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend appears to be continuing. Ms. Lokitz of Corcoran said she was supposed to take a client to an open house for a ''charming and quaint'' co-op on the Upper West Side on Sunday. But with the temperatures icy, the client, who was feeling ill, decided to wait. When Ms. Lokitz called the seller's broker on Monday to arrange a visit, ''they already had four offers,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Elliman Market Overview, the average size of an apartment sold in Manhattan last quarter shrank to 1,280 square feet, from 1,302 in the third quarter and 1,437 square feet in the fourth quarter of 2000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People realize they have to be more receptive to things that normally they might not have been able to accept before,'' Ms. Lokitz said. ''A few years ago, if you said to somebody that you had a one-bedroom for 600 square feet, they were appalled and said, 'I can't live in that amount of space.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the other end of the market, the shrinking supply of two- and three-bedroom apartments hurt buyers hoping to upgrade from their one- or two-bedroom homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a two-bedroom rose 9 percent in the fourth quarter, to $1,140,377, from $1,045,648 a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the condo market, the price increases for larger places were even more striking. The average for a two-bedroom apartment rose 7.2 percent, to $1,450,640 in the fourth quarter, from $1,353,520 in the third quarter. A three-bedroom condo averaged $3,278,823 in the fourth quarter, up 13.2 percent from $2,895,705 in the quarter before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda Brainerd, an agent at Warburg Realty, said condo prices were driven in part by the fact that the supply was limited, but also by an increase in demand from relatively young buyers who were finding it difficult to meet the financial requirements of co-op boards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let's say there's some 38-year-old guy on Wall Street who makes $1.2 million a year in salary, has three kids and wants to buy a $5 million condo,'' Ms. Brainerd said. To qualify for a co-op, she said, the buyer would probably have to show that he had $10 million to $15 million in liquid assets. ''He hasn't had enough time to sock away $10 million or $15 million in cash,'' she said. ''But if you're buying a condo, you just need enough money for a down payment and to be able to pay your monthly mortgage. The higher the prices get, the higher the stakes are with the co-op boards.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of two- and three-bedroom condos picked up in the last quarter of the year. For example, Robert E. Doernberg, director of condominium sales at Warburg Realty, said that at Bridge Tower Place, a 38-story skyscraper at 401 East 60th Street, five three-bedroom apartments sold in the fourth quarter, with price rises of more than 10 percent within just three months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some of them were languishing on the market, and all of a sudden -- boom, boom, boom! -- they sold in the fourth quarter,'' Mr. Doernberg said. He said one sold for $1.85 million at the beginning of the quarter, and an identical unit on a different floor sold for $2.1 million in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although brokers have been exchanging hyperbolic anecdotes about the return of the ''super luxury'' category -- above $3 million -- the Elliman Market Overview showed that in the fourth quarter the average sale price of luxury apartments fell 7.8 percent, to $3.19 million, from the prior quarter. But that might have been in part because buyers were having to make do with slightly smaller apartments: the average square footage of a luxury apartment dropped to 2,516 square feet, from 2,702.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's almost an incentive to move to Dallas. That four-bedroom, four-bathroom house with granite countertops and vaulted ceilings, for $470,000? It's 3,189 square feet.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending rose for a sixth consecutive month in November, to an all-time high, and builders started work on houses at a record rate, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1.2 percent increase in overall construction, to a $934.5 billion annual pace, came after a revised 1.1 percent gain in October. Residential construction, which accounts for more than half the total, rose 1.9 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates have underpinned the demand for housing, which accounted for about a percentage point of the 8.2 percent increase in the gross domestic product in the third quarter. Construction spending on offices and other commercial buildings also increased in November.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Construction spending will boost G.D.P. in the fourth quarter and it should continue to buoy growth going forward,'' said Maria Forres, an economist at the investment firm Griffin, Kubik, Stephens &amp; Thompson in Chicago, which had forecast a November rise of 1.1 percent. The increase exceeded a Bloomberg News economists' estimate of a 0.5 percent rise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the first 11 months of 2003, spending on construction totaled $828.1 billion, 4 percent above the $795.7 billion in the period a year earlier.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflecting what the chief executive of the New York State Association of Realtors, Charles M. Staro, called ''a later-than-usual fall slowdown,'' sales of existing single-family homes across the state slipped by 23.1 percent in November, compared with October.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales prices crept up by 2.4 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 7,450 sales in November in the 59 counties (not including Manhattan) that provide data to the realtors association, down from 9,687 in October.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The November sales total also represented a 1.3 percent dip from the 7,551 sales in November 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the statewide median sales price in November rose to $210,000 from $205,000 in October, a 2.4 percent increase. When compared with November 2002, when the median price was $165,000, last month's price represented a 27.3 percent jump.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the slip in sales volume in November, Mr. Staro said the data indicate that 2003 will ''finish among the top five since we began tracking home sales 20 years ago.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median selling price of existing single-family homes in New York outside Manhattan was up 25.1 percent in October from the level of October 2002, according to preliminary data accumulated by the New York State Association of Realtors.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statewide median selling price of $205,749 in October compared with a median of $164,500 in October 2002. But the median price in October was 7.3 percent lower than the September level.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PLEASANTVILLE -- LIKE any number of people in the corporate world, Peter Olsen of Cortlandt Manor had a soaring career that hit a patch of turbulence two years ago. He was forced into early retirement from his job as a vice president at Deutsche Bank in Manhattan after the company bought Bankers Trust. He tried consulting, but work dried up after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. So Mr. Olsen decided to turn his gaze from the misfortunes of the city he had worked in for more than 20 years to the booming housing market in his own backyard.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, shortly before his 60th birthday, Mr. Olsen became a real estate agent in the Yorktown office of Prudential Rand Realty. In doing so, he became an emblem of a trend -- the recent sharp rise in the number of real estate agents in Westchester County.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until two years ago, the Westchester County Board of Realtors averaged about 4,000 members a year, said Richard Haggerty, the board's director of member services. Last year, that number jumped to 4,800, and by last month membership was up to 5,600.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Olsen is not daunted by these figures. He has already sold 10 homes at commissions of approximately $3,000 to $3,500 each, meeting in nine months his goal for his first year in business. He said his experience in the corporate world has prepared him for the challenge. ''I love competition,'' he said. ''If I didn't have the competition, I'd be uncomfortable.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate has long held appeal as a career for people looking for flexibility, from retirees who want an office to go to a few hours a week to stay-at-home parents looking to phase themselves back into the work force to teachers and other professionals pursuing a second income. What has become more common recently are agents like Mr. Olsen, who are coming into the field from the corporate world.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garry Klein, an associate broker at Prudential Rand who teaches a real estate licensing course in the Adult and Continuing Education program at Pace University, said there is another reason that real estate attracts those interested in a career change: It is a relatively easy field to enter. The only requirements are a 45-hour training course and a licensing exam, both mandated by New York State.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once licensed, though, real estate brokers face the challenge of getting started without a regular salary. Though agents usually work under the supervision of a broker, the paycheck comes entirely from commissions, which are split among the listing agent, the listing broker, the cooperating agent (who has found the buyer) and the cooperating broker. That typically comes to 1 1/2 percent of the home price for each, unless the agent found both the buyer and seller, in which case the commission doubles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no statistics kept on the average income of a real estate agent in Westchester County, Mr. Haggerty said. Part-time agents with a low sales volume are so common that an often-heard aphorism among brokers is that ''80 percent of the homes are sold by 20 percent of the agents.'' Income, they say, depends heavily on commitment; availability; the ability to find both sellers who want to list their homes and buyers for homes listed by other brokers; and the ability to stay on top of the market, network, listen, and, of course, sell.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Klein attributes the recent swelling of interest in real estate to both the lure of Westchester's skyrocketing home prices and the nature of the real estate industry. ''You create your own business,'' he said. ''You set your own goals, objectives, hours. You're not going to get downsized.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But though the threat of getting a pink slip may be minimal in a real estate office, there is the risk of getting crowded out in a field where the number of agents is growing much faster than the number of homes on the market. While the median price of a home in Westchester reached a record $588,250 in the third quarter of 2003, the stock of available housing is about half of its historical average and the number of houses for sale rose only 9 percent from the third quarter of 2002 to the third quarter of 2003, according to figures from the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing popularity of the real estate profession was one reason that Bill Hozel, 50, of White Plains left the business in 2000, after only three years as an agent with Century 21. He said he was ''doing very well,'' averaging 15 home sales a year, but he started to notice an increase in the number of agents coming into the industry. ''It lessened the averages of getting a listing.'' A former medical sales executive, he was unsettled by the instability of the real estate sales process, where closings could drag on unpredictably, leaving him waiting months for his commission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longtime real estate brokers are also feeling the pinch. ''Personally, I have seen my business being chipped away at by some of these new Realtors,'' said Robin Birritella, an associate broker who has worked in the Dobbs Ferry office of Coldwell Banker for 13 years. ''You feel like one or two of them may be getting one or two listings you might have gotten,''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some new agents, attracted by real estate's reputation for flexibility, discover that it takes more than a part-time commitment to make their new careers work. Gloria Rosen, a psychotherapist in Rye Brook, took up real estate for a year, only to find that ''it was not possible to do both at the same time,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Real estate demanded full-time attention,'' she said. ''It's a very competitive profession.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holmes &amp; Kennedy Real Estate, which has offices in Armonk, Chappaqua and Pleasantville, takes only full-time new agents, said Amy Cane, the agency's executive vice president for sales. She also expects new agents to be ready to handle the habits of today's buyers. ''They're much more Internet-savvy,'' she said. ''Our agents have to be more technologically-oriented, better educated, and more professional than ever before.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Klein's real estate licensing course at Pace University, though, few students interviewed said they were ready to abandon the security and benefits of their current careers to plunge full time into real estate. Christina Calicchia, a financial systems consultant, said she would eventually like to become a broker and open her own agency. ''At first, though, I'd love to do both my job full time and real estate part time until I can get going,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cathy Pappas, a registered nurse for 16 years, said she had no plans to abandon her profession for full-time real estate work. Real estate ''could be nice extra money,'' she said. ''I think it will be easier for me because I don't need the income.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Klein said that, although part-time work in real estate can be a good way to ''get your feet wet,'' some of his students who are reluctant to devote all their attention to real estate may be in for a struggle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate newcomers are determined to prove that flexibility does not necessarily interfere with profitability.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suzette Kraus, a broker with Holmes &amp; Kennedy in the Chappaqua office, got her license two years ago. Her schedule allows her to be with her school-age children if they need her, but she described herself as fully committed to her new career.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It takes time to build your business,'' she said. ''You have to be in it for the long term. You can't just say, 'I'll give it a year.' You have to make it full time.''   </p>

</div><div>By Bloomberg News</div>
<div>461 words</div><div>20 November 2003</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2003 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts of new housing unexpectedly rose in October to the highest level in almost 18 years, led by record single-family home building, the Commerce Department said yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders began work on 1.96 million homes at an annual pace last month, the fastest since January 1986 and a 2.9 percent increase from a revised 1.905 million pace in September. Building permits, an indicator of future construction, rose 5.2 percent, to 1.973 million, the highest since 1984.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is ''the gift that just keeps giving,'' said Richard DeKaser, an economist at the National City Corporation in Cleveland. More permits, Mr. DeKaser said, ''guarantee a solid fourth quarter.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing and consumer spending were the linchpins for the economy when growth again slowed at the end of 2002 and in the first quarter of this year. Continued strength in home sales and construction is now being accompanied by more corporate purchases of equipment, suggesting sounder economic expansion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interest rate on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is less than a percentage point higher than June's record low of 5.21 percent, bolstering new-home sales, which the National Association of Home Builders forecasts will reach a record.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a mixed note, new-home construction increased in the West and South but fell in other regions of the country. Housing starts rose 17.7 percent in the West, to a 526,000 annual pace, the highest since December 1986. They increased 4.9 percent in the South, to a pace of 898,000, the highest since January 1986. In the Northeast, though, starts fell 18 percent, to an annual 146,000, and in the Midwest, they were down 8 percent, to a 390,000 pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction accounts for 5 percent of the value of goods and services in the United States and leads to spending on major purchases like furniture and appliances.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast housing starts to drop to a 1.850 million annual pace from the previously reported 1.888 million in September.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts of single-family homes jumped 5.7 percent, to a record 1.617 million unit pace, from 1.53 million a month earlier. But starts of apartment buildings and other multiple-unit residential property dropped 8.5 percent, to a 343,000 annual pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits for single-family homes rose 3.2 percent, to a record 1.535 million annual pace. Total permits have held at 1.8 million or higher for six consecutive months for the first time since 1973.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental-housing vacancy rate rose to a record 9.9 percent in the third quarter from 9.6 percent in the second quarter.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of extended families living in single-family homes has reached record levels in the state, a result of rapidly increasing home prices, according to the University of Massachusetts. The number of ''subfamilies,'' or parents who move in with relatives because they cannot afford housing, nearly doubled in the past two decades to 52,008 in 2000. The median home price in the state is $287,000, the third highest in the country behind Hawaii and California. Katie Zezima (NYT)   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''THE bubble never burst!'' Leah Caro, the manager of Bronxville-Ley Real Estate exclaimed happily last week, echoing the sentiments of other sales agents throughout Westchester. ''Everyone was predicting the residential real estate market wouldn't hold up, but that's not the case.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quite the contrary, according to the third quarter report from the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. It said that the median price of a single-family house in the county reached an all-time high of $588,250. That is up 3 percent from the comparable period a year ago, when the median was at a record $570,750, said P. Gil Mercurio, executive vice president of the Board of Realtors, who characterized the rise as healthy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not looking for large increases in appreciation,'' Mr. Mercurio explained. ''Three percent is in line with improvements in the general economy. A negative would be if the price increases far outpaced the economy, because that could drive potential customers away from the market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the report said, the county recorded its seventh consecutive quarter of year-to-year inventory increases. This increase in the supply of houses on the market is also described as having a long-awaited positive effect on prices and sales volumes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The area's supply of for-sale housing is about half of its historic average, and that deficiency has constituted a serious brake on sales volume since 1999,'' the third-quarter report said. ''Insufficient inventory limits choice, drives up prices and therefore discourages many potential buyers.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">End-of-quarter inventory was a total of 4,546 units for sale in four housing categories -- up 9 percent from 4,163 in the third quarter of 2002. The single-family housing stock peaked at 6,699 homes on the market at the end of the second quarter of 1995; the figure fell to a low of 1,655 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2000 and has been edging up since then.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slow but steady increase in the median price and the easing of the inventory crunch were not the only indicators of a healthy residential real estate market, the listing service said. The number of residential sales that closed during the third quarter of 2003 increased sharply from a year earlier, reflecting sales of properties that had been listed and marketed during the second quarter of the year, which is traditionally the busiest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate firms participating in the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service reported 3,086 closings in Westchester in the third quarter, an increase of 14 percent from last year's third quarter volume.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT is more, each residential property type tracked in Westchester -- single-family houses, condominiums, co-ops and two- to five-family houses -- showed year-to-year increases in sales. And the increases were at least 10 percent in all sectors except multifamily houses. There were 1,990 single family homes sold in the third quarter, up 10 percent from a year earlier. Condo sales were up 38 percent, to 415; co-op sales were up 21 percent, to 545; and multifamily home sales rose by 5 percent, to 136.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of a condo rose 7 percent, to $303,000, in the third quarter from the corresponding period in 2002. The median co-op price rose 14 percent, to $125,000. And the median for two- to five-family houses was up 12 percent, to $424,500. (The median sale price is the midpoint of all reported sales and is not affected by unusually low or high sale prices.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to somewhat increased activity in the general economy, the residential real estate market was fueled by continuing low interest rates for mortgages. During the period that generated closings in the third quarter, the average rate on a 30-year conventional mortgage ranged from about 6 percent in April to as low as 5.3 percent by mid-June, climbing to 6 percent again in mid-July, depending on the size of the loan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Besides the boosts from more inventory and stable low mortgage interest rates, the area's real estate market also benefited from the absence of any seriously bad news affecting the local labor force or job market,'' the listing service's report said. The area's unemployment rate has stayed in the range of 3.5 to 4 percent for more than a year, which is lower than that of New York City, New York State and the nation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who is buying? Couples in their 30's and 40's with children, according to James Whittemore, the co-owner of Burbank/Whittemore-Better Homes &amp; Gardens in Larchmont, who does not rely solely on official statistics to understand the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Other ways we can tell who's buying are by all the coloring books we're supplying to kids coming into the office with their parents and all of the car seats in the cars parked outside,'' Mr. Whittemore said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses priced in the $500,000 to $900,000 range are selling fastest, although even more expensive homes are being snapped up fast if they are priced right, Mr. Whittemore said. He cited as an example an English Tudor with a new kitchen and other upgrades, which recently came on the market for $1.1 million. It received multiple bids and went to contract within three days, selling for the listed price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An example in the midrange of the residential market is a four-bedroom, two-bath English Tudor on the market on 16 Sprague Road in the Edgewood section of Scarsdale for $697,000. ''It's a perfect entry-level house for young professionals from Wall Street or the business sector who are looking to move into this area,'' said Linda Roth, the branch manager of Coldwell Banker Doernberg in Scarsdale.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BY comparison, houses in the $3 million and above range are taking longer to move -- on average a year or more -- but they are nevertheless selling, said Anthony P. Cutugno, Houlihan/Lawrence's senior vice president for luxury properties.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They may be sitting on the market for a longer time, but we're certainly not having any fire sales,'' Mr. Cutugno said, explaining that because the supply of homes for $1 million and above has increased, there is not the same urgency among buyers as there was two years ago, when inventory figures were far lower. Houlihan/Lawrence did not have comparative inventory figures available for that market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, Mr. Mercurio at the Multiple Listing Service emphasized that there is no certainty that the market's strength will continue. Price increases need to stay moderate, he said. ''Of course, we don't want them to go in reverse,'' he added, ''but we're certainly not looking for large increases in appreciation that outpace the general economy, because that would take people out of the market in a hurry. That's definitely something to watch out for.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mercurio is also monitoring employment figures and the public's optimism (or lack of it) about jobs. ''Especially with respect to jobs, we need to watch out for the economy slipping backward again,'' he said. ''Even more than the job figures themselves, it's the perception of employment that's key. If people are insecure about their current circumstances or worry about getting another job, they're not likely to move into the home buying market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the listing service report, the circumstance that would most disturb the local real estate market in the coming months would be a sharp increase in mortgage interest rates to 8 percent or higher, although few analysts are predicting that. According to HSH Associates, the rate on a 30-year conventional mortgage in the New York City region was a bit above 6 percent in late October.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth Polin, president of Banner Mortgage Group in Scarsdale, cautioned that rates do not have to rise by two percentage points to slow down real estate activity if the increase in rates is rapid. ''It can shake people's confidence,'' he said. ''They think that if rates can go seven-eighths of a percent in a day, what might they do in a few months?''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 -- Sales of new homes edged down in September, the Commerce Department reported on Monday, but they nevertheless registered the third-highest level on record.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from a trade group showed that sales of previously owned homes again had their best month -- fresh evidence that the housing market continues to help spur economic recovery.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department put new-home sales at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.145 million in September, a 0.2 percent dip from the previous month. Even with that, sales were stronger than the 1.125 million pace that analysts were forecasting. New-home sales posted their best month ever in June, at a pace of 1.2 million units, and their second-best month in August, at an annual pace of 1.147 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the other report, the National Association of Realtors said that existing-home sales rose 3.6 percent in September, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 6.69 million units, the third consecutive record month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, new-home sales in September soared by 26 percent in the Northeast, to an annual pace of 97,000, and in the West they rose 12.4 percent, to a pace of 335,000. But in the Midwest, sales fell 18 percent, to a pace of 209,000, and in the South, they dipped 2.5 percent, to a 504,000-unit pace.  </p>

</div><div>By Bloomberg News</div>
<div>441 words</div><div>18 October 2003</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2003 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of home construction rose in September to its second-highest level since 1986 as Americans sought to lock in low mortgage rates and construction companies worked to fill a backlog of orders, a government report showed yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders started work on 1.888 million homes at an annual rate last month, up 3.4 percent from the revised 1.826 million started in August, the Commerce Department said. The September figure exceeded the median forecast of a 1.83 million annual rate in a survey of economists by Bloomberg News.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing economy continues to surprise everyone but the builders,'' said Joel H. Rassman, chief financial officer of Toll Brothers Inc., the largest builder of luxury homes in the United States. ''There's a huge pent-up demand that has yet to be satisfied.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand is increasing in part as Americans gain confidence in the economy. The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for October increased to 89.4 from 87.7 in September, beating the median forecast. Yesterday, economists at Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch raised their estimates for third-quarter growth to 6 percent, which would be the fastest growth in almost four years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast a reading of 88.2 for the consumer sentiment index, based on the median of 57 estimates in a survey. They also estimated that housing starts would rise from the previously reported 1.82 million in August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, an indicator of future production, slipped 2.2 percent, to 1.86 million. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen less than a percentage point from a record low reached in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homebuilder optimism this month was the highest in almost four years, according to the National Association of Home Builders. The group's housing market index rose to 72 in October from 68 in September.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction accounts for 5 percent of the value of goods and services produced in the United States and has been supporting economic expansion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts of single-family homes climbed 3.1 percent in September, to a rate of 1.52 million after a 1.47 million pace in August. Starts of apartment buildings and other multifamily homes rose 4.5 percent, to a 368,000 rate in September.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">No Price Bubble in Region's Housing, Study Concludes   </span>
</div><div class="author">By DENNIS HEVESI   </div><div>634 words</div><div>17 October 2003</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2003 New York Times Company   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not a bubble, so it won't burst.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, essentially, is the conclusion of an economic study of the current housing market in the New Jersey, New York and Connecticut region by two professors at Rutgers University. Using the home-price plunge of the late 80's for comparison, they have calculated that price increases for single-family homes in the region in the last five years have not been excessive.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, ''Housing Bubble or Shelter -- Safe Haven?'' states: ''The regional housing market is not about to suffer a collapse. The bursting of the housing bubble in 1988 will remain a subject of history, not a predictor of our housing future.'' The study was written by James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, and Joseph J. Seneca, a professor of economics at the Bloustein school.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1980's, Dr. Hughes said in an interview, ''We did have an extraordinary ratcheting up of housing prices and then a very severe price setback during the '89-'92 recession.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 1983 and 1988, home prices in New Jersey rose by 109 percent, the report found. In Connecticut, they jumped by 120 percent. In New York, because of a stagnant economy upstate, the increase was a more modest 76 percent. Those increases far outpaced the national rate of 37 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They were not sustainable,'' Dr. Hughes said. And in the ensuing recession, they retreated 7.8 percent in New Jersey, 18 percent in Connecticut and 4.5 percent in New York.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would take until 1998 in New Jersey and New York and 2000 in Connecticut for home prices to climb back to their 1988 peak. ''What that suggests,'' Dr. Hughes said, ''is that economic wild parties are followed by prolonged hangovers.'' Those calculations do not account for a 32 percent rise in inflation between 1988 and 1998, meaning that in real dollars, prices in 1998 remained 30 percent below their 1988 peak.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study goes on to point out that price increases in the last five years have been far more modest than those during the five-year bubble of the 80's. In New Jersey, they increased by 52 percent between 1998 and 2002; in New York, by 53 percent, and in Connecticut by 44 percent. By comparison, housing prices across the nation increased by 38 percent in the same period.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the current price gains were far less than those in the 1980's, the report found. And the gap between the three states and the nation was considerably smaller. ''Therefore,'' Dr. Hughes said, ''it's hard to make a case, at least on a statewide basis, that the price increases of the last five years have been excessive.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study then addressed the factors that have supported the price rises of the last five years. ''No. 1 is that by 1998,'' Dr. Hughes said, ''the financial position of many households was bolstered by stock market gains, whether it was their 401(k)'s or even if they just owned mutual funds. Given that supposed financial security, people were willing to spend more on housing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, mortgage interest rates dropped from 8 percent in 2000 to 5.5 percent in 2003 -- a 45-year low. Then, in March 2000, the stock market plummeted. ''And that made housing even more desirable,'' Dr. Hughes said. ''It was seen as the safe port in the economic storm.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report concludes: ''All of the gains in housing-purchasing power as a result of interest-rate reductions in the current market probably have been made. So upward pressure on prices is bound to diminish.''   </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">What Can a Million Buy in Manhattan? Something Average   </span>
</div><div class="author">By DENNIS HEVESI   </div><div>1188 words</div><div>15 October 2003</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2003 New York Times Company   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau says that the typical American household made $42,409 last year. At that rate, this family could buy an average-priced Manhattan apartment after just a little more than 21 years, if luxuries like food and clothing were skipped and entire incomes were forked over. And then there's the maintenance.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price for an apartment in Manhattan was $919,959 in the third quarter of this year -- another record high -- according to the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report, one of the most comprehensive real estate surveys.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part because so many of the sales in Manhattan are in the seven-figure range, the average is skewed upward.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of an apartment in Manhattan for the third quarter of 2003, the exact middle of all the sales, was $575,000, the Elliman survey found -- still no bargain for the typical American family.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the first time the average price cracked the $900,000 threshold. Buyers in Manhattan apparently shrugged at concerns about the economy; that $916,959 average surpassed the previous high of $894,617 set in the second quarter of 2001.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This record represents a rebound for Manhattan apartments. During the weakest period in the last five years -- the first quarter of 2002 -- the average price was $788,256.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are few places in the country where it might make sense to pay such prices,'' said Dr. James. W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''If you're in the middle of a cornfield in the Midwest, you're going to have a hard time finding someone to resell to. The rich are only willing to buy and live in a few select locations and -- obviously -- Manhattan is one of them.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who have never experienced the cold shower of looking for a home in Manhattan might think that $900,000 would buy a fancy five-bedroom apartment with gold-plated faucets, free maid service and one of those concierges who gets you tickets to ''The Producers.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, here's the cold shower. Do a quick search of The New York Times on the Web's current sales listings and look for places in the same areas the survey covered: below West 116th Street and below East 96th Street. Yesterday you would have found a dozen apartments for sale for $900,000. There is one three-bedroom apartment, eight two-bedrooms, two one-bedrooms and one place where the new owners will have to build their own bedroom walls.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, these are very fancy one-bedroom apartments. One of the units listed for sale, a condominium on West 37th Street, was designed by its Italian architect/owner. Another, on East 73rd Street, has two fireplaces and really high ceilings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how come there are so many people willing to pay that much for a box in the sky? Real estate professionals say there has been a continuing crunch in the number of available apartments and a significant bounce in the luxury market (''luxury'' here, of course, is defined as amounts resembling the G.D.P.'s of small Caribbean nations).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All this occurred despite lingering trepidation over local, national and international economic conditions,'' said Jonathan Miller, president of the Miller Samuel appraisal company, which prepared the Elliman report.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even billionaires feel bear markets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly, Manhattan is linked to the health of the stock market,'' Dr. Hughes said. ''And so, the stock market rally of the last six months has certainly improved the financial wherewithal of many affluent households.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The record price of $919,959 was an 8 percent jump from the $849,013 the average apartment sold for in the third quarter of 2002.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That median price of $575,000 for a Manhattan apartment was unchanged from the previous quarter, but up by 10.8 percent over the median price of $519,000 during the third quarter of last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report is based on 2,324 co-op and condominium sales collected from many listing agencies. Those totals represented an increase of 13.1 percent over the 2,055 sales recorded in the second quarter of this year, and 3.7 percent above the 2,241 sales in the third quarter of 2002.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market provided more buyers, but sellers were scarce. By the end of the third quarter, the number of available apartments had dropped to 5,224, 17.7 percent lower than the 6,346 units on the market in March.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those sellers who did cash out almost all did well. The average price for studio apartments was $303,895, up by 17.4 percent from the $258,826 price in the same period last year. One-bedrooms sold for an average of $471,531, an increase of 12.6 percent above $418,607 in the third quarter last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two-bedrooms, the average price was $1,073,966 (this doesn't make that $919,959 look so bad, right?). This was an increase of 6.2 percent over the average two-bedroom's price of $1,011,790 last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only sellers who did not hit the jackpot were those peddling three-bedrooms. There, the average price was $2,468,286, down by 3.3 percent from $2,553,537 last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the lucky people in a cramped borough with an apartment that has at least four bedrooms, they got an average price of $5,698,266, up by 4.6 percent over 2002's $5,445,396.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study also calculated changes in the luxury market -- defined as the top 10 percent of all co-op and condominium prices. In the third quarter of this year, that meant an average price of $3,461,532; a 10.6 percent gain over last year's $3,128,424.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kirk Henckels, director of Stribling Private Brokerage, the luxury division of the brokerage firm Stribling &amp; Associates, said that the most expensive co-op sale in the first half of this year was about $20 million. ''That's versus the highest sale of about $13 million in 2002,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the party appears to be continuing. Mr. Henckels said that 2003 stood to rival 2000 for big-ticket sales -- at least 18 sales of $10 million or more. ''It would appear,'' he said, ''that we are about to equal the peak of the luxury market.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment prices in Manhattan remained resilient in the second quarter of this year, according to companion reports by the Real Estate Board of New York. ''Despite the recent rise in interest rates and continued slowdown in the city's economy, New Yorkers are still investing in housing,'' said Steven Spinola, the president of the board.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two reports, for condominiums and co-ops, were based on a total of 738 sales below 96th Street in the second quarter of this year, compared with 692 in the corresponding quarter in 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the postwar condominium category, the median price per square foot increased by 4 percent, from $624 to $649. And for prewar condominiums, the price per square foot increased 8 percent, to $640 from $592.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For co-ops, the median price per room -- not including bathrooms -- rose 3 percent in the studio and one-bedroom category, to $111,429 from $108,184 a year ago. And for two-bedroom co-ops, the median price was up 5 percent, to $172,222 from $164,020. However, in the three-bedroom category, co-op prices decreased by 9 percent, to $232,051 from $255,001. In light of the wide range of apartment layouts, the board believes that using price per room provides the fairest comparison.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chairman of the real estate board's residential research committee, Hall F. Willkie of Brown Harris Stevens, said, ''While the co-op market is not as strong as it was six to nine months ago, when it reached all-time highs, it remains robust with prices still appreciating in some areas.''  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Hudson Valley House Prices Are Called Unaffordable  </span>
</div><div class="author">By DEBRA WEST  </div><div>912 words</div><div>24 September 2003</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>5</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2003 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices in the suburbs north of New York City have grown so far out of reach for many residents that 79 percent of households there would not have been able to qualify for a conventional 90 percent mortgage if they tried to buy a median-priced home in their own community in the spring of 2002, a study released today by the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report is the second in a series commissioned by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. that will examine the affordability of housing in different regions throughout the state.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The labor federation commissioned the report to bolster its case for a bill that it lobbied for and got introduced in the State Senate this year calling for state subsidies of housing for the middle class.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a crisis in affordable housing in New York,'' said Denis M. Hughes, president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O., which represents 2.5 million unionized workers from teachers to tradesmen. ''People tend not to realize that you can go to work and make a decent salary and still not be able to afford housing here. There is a very good chance that when your kids grow up and start their own family, they won't be able to stay in the area.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester, a buyer would have had to earn $187,000 to buy the median-priced $520,000 home, at 90 percent financing, the report found. In Rockland, a buyer would have to earn $123,000 to qualify for the median home at $343,000, and in Putnam, the buyer would have to earn $83,655 to qualify for the $285,000 median-priced home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in Sullivan County, which has little industry and is too far for most who commute to New York City, the median home price reached $90,000, meaning a buyer would have to earn $32,400 to qualify for a 90 percent mortgage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And these numbers, of course, do not reflect how much income buyers would need to qualify for the 50 percent of homes that are above the median price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill in Albany includes ideas like giving direct rent subsidies to people whose incomes are as high as $100,000, state investment in housing development and rehabilitation for middle-income residents, and funds to cut the cost of development, Mr. Hughes said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he could not estimate how much money would be required.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report released today looks at housing in the Hudson Valley, which it defined as the seven counties north of New York City: Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange, Ulster and Sullivan. There are 772,000 households in the region, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The union's first report was released in July and focused on Long Island. It found an even worse housing squeeze on the middle class.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both reports were prepared by David M. Muchnick of Sustainable Enterprise, a Manhattan consulting firm. The next reports will examine the Albany area and New York City.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new building is taking place in the Hudson Valley (70,900 homes were built between 1990 and 2000), it has not kept pace with an increase in households, Mr. Muchnick said. There is a shortage of 12,100 units of housing during the decade.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For groups who need housing that costs less than the median price, like single parents and the elderly, there is a shortfall of 13,500 units, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 200,000 to 300,000 adults ages 20 to 34 still live with their parents in the Hudson Valley, because they cannot find housing they can afford. This represents an enormous pent-up demand, in addition to the 12,100-unit shortage, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing problem reaches across nearly all sectors of the economy, from teachers, tradesmen and uniformed services to entry-level corporate and professional jobs, Mr. Muchnick said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decade from 1990 to 2000 was marked by widespread increases in housing costs, with median monthly mortgage costs rising 23 percent in Westchester and 41 percent in Ulster and Sullivan Counties.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other costs of homeownership, including taxes, utilities, insurance and fuel, increased 30 percent in Dutchess County and 62 percent in Westchester.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For renters, the cost of renting grew even faster than the cost of ownership.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester, where 40 percent of households rent, the fair-market rent of a two-bedroom apartment rose by 57 percent to $1,108. Sixty percent of apartments cost more than the fair-market rent, a category defined by the study.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WARREN E. BUFFETT'S astute eye for spotting money-making opportunities in the nuts-and-bolts of daily life is no secret.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last three years, his company, Berkshire Hathaway, has assembled a profitable collection of companies that flourish by providing mundane but necessary things: bricks, paints, wall covering, roofing, insulation and carpets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those companies have done well partly because of the strong U.S. housing market. At the same time, Berkshire has become more entrenched at the other end of the business: selling houses. Berkshire's Home Services of America acquired three firms last year and has become one of the largest residential real estate brokerage firms in the country. Now, Mr. Buffett has set his sights on the black-sheep sector of the otherwise prosperous housing industry: manufactured houses. Demand for factory-made housing has been plunging and is now at a four-decade low. Construction capacity has dropped by more than half in the last five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the grim landscape, Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, all but closed a deal this summer to buy one of the industry's most profitable companies, Clayton Homes Inc. of Maryville, Tenn., for $17.5 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transaction, however, is not completed, pending a decision in the next few weeks by the Tennessee Supreme Court on whether to hear an appeal by a Clayton institutional investor trying to overturn the deal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 1990's, manufactured houses accounted for 20 percent of single-family housing starts, according to Census Bureau tallies. Producing a manufactured house costs 20 percent to 30 percent less than building a house on the site, even after including the expense of trucking the houses to the sites, according to an analysis of the sector produced last year for the Ford Foundation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the economic advantages of factory construction, the sector's linchpin is money for loans to homebuyers. Historically, it has been a difficult area for lending because many of the buyers have weak credit histories and, at least in the past, the houses tended to depreciate as cars do, in part because many were placed on leased lots. Too many bad loans in the mid-1990's resulted in hundreds of thousands of houses being repossessed, which limited the demand for building.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While lending in this sector is hazardous, a conservative approach seems to bear fruit. ''Ultimately, if you do good loans, you are going to be able to make money,'' said Barbara Allen, housing analyst at Natexis Bleichroeder.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Berkshire plans to provide a secure stream of capital to Clayton's mortgage-financing operations; Kevin T. Clayton, the company's president, said those operations require $1 billion a year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Berkshire executives declined to discuss the purchase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clayton sells the houses in 297 retail outlets and provides mortgages and insurance through a financing subsidiary. Analysts say the company has a record of conservative underwriting and successful lending.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John H. Diffendal, an analyst at BB&amp;T Capital Markets, says Berkshire's entrance may mark the beginning of a rebound. ''When Warren E. Buffett puts his stake in the ground, it says it's time for others to take a look at this industry,'' Mr. Diffendal said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, manufactured housing itself has improved. In the 1950's, boxy units started popping up as companies tried to address housing shortages after World War II.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The majority of new factory-built houses are made of multiple sections and average 1,715 square feet. They tend to be similar to modest houses that are built on site. Over all, the average manufactured house sold for $51,300, according to the Census Bureau. And the median household income for the homeowners is $28,900, according to the Foremost Insurance Group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TO large house builders, factory construction provides a way to drive down material and labor costs, and to prepare for expected shortages of workers who have building trade skills.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need to figure out ways to build more units with fewer people,'' said James P. Zeumer, a spokesman for Pulte Homes Inc., in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., which builds houses under the Del Webb brand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This fall, a Pulte operation in Manassas, Va., will begin making shells of houses: precast concrete basements and foundations, floors, walls and roofing. A shell can be built in four to five days versus 20 days at a house site, Mr. Zeumer said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Population trends are likely to bode well for manufactured housing. Immigrants, particularly the growing number of Hispanic immigrants, will drive up demand for low-cost starter houses in the next two decades, said Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those immigrants are in the South and West, where factory-built housing is most established, and retail outlets there are adapting to attract them. The growing ranks of baby boomers' children, now moving into early adulthood, are also increasing demand for entry-level houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Manufactured housing could not only rebound, but play a very substantial role in affordable housing,'' Mr. Retsinas said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As demand for these entry-level houses rises, some conventional builders will also try to capture the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no guarantee that manufactured housing will have it all to themselves,'' Ms. Allen said.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home Building Holds Up Amid Higher Rates  </span>
</div><div>By Bloomberg News</div>
<div>460 words</div><div>18 September 2003</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2003 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 3.8 percent in August from a 17-year high in July and building permits for single-family homes were a record, the Commerce Department said yesterday, signs that residential construction is holding up amid higher mortgage rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders started work on homes at an annual rate of 1.82 million last month, down from the pace of 1.89 million in July, the department said. Building permits for single-family homes rose to a 1.48 million rate, the highest since record-keeping began in 1959.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What the builders are telling us is that they're just kind of keeping up with buyer demand which is very, very good,'' said David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. ''I'm sitting around here being forced to increase my forecast for the rest of this year.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are working through a backlog of orders that had piled up earlier this year when home sales reached a record. Mortgage rates, while up about one percentage point from June's record low, are down from last year's average. Home purchase applications last week were the highest since late July, a separate report showed yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Seiders forecast 1.76 million homes to be built this year, the most since 1.81 million in 1986. He had been expecting 1.73 million for 2003. Residential construction accounts for about 5 percent of the value of goods and services produced in the United States and, along with consumer spending, has been supporting economic expansion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing's contribution to growth will be positive in the third quarter, and likely neutral in the fourth,'' said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. ''Any weakening in housing investment due to higher mortgage rates is not likely to show up until 2004.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications for home purchases rose for a third week last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. The group's index of purchase applications climbed to 432.4, the highest since the week ended Aug. 1.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in building permits, which often provide a signal of construction activity in coming months, was led by a 2.9 percent gain for single-family homes. Total permits rose 4.8 percent, to 1.886 million, the fourth consecutive month they have held above 1.8 million. That has not happened since 1973.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The Price of 'Wow!' Keeps On Rising</span>
</div><div class="author">By NADINE BROZAN   </div><div>2837 words</div><div>7 September 2003</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2003 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE was a time when Kirk Henckels, director of private brokerage for the tony firm of Stribling &amp; Associates, would refer to an apartment on the market for $10 million as ''a trophy property.'' No more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now I just call it a $10 million property,'' Mr. Henckels remarked. The term trophy does not enter his vocabulary until the asking price hits $20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boundary between ultrahigh luxury prices and routine high prices depends, of course, on who's drawing the line and from what vantage point. But by and large, brokers, developers and appraisers agree that it lies somewhere north of $10 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It used to be that you would walk into a $10 million property and it would be like seeing someone wearing a 25-carat engagement ring,'' said Michele Kleier, president of Gumley Haft Kleier. ''Now you look at something at $10 million and say, 'Where do I start gutting?' and 'How many more millions do I have to put in?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a firm that appraises about 5,000 properties a year, also sets the bar higher. ''I think that $10 million is not high enough for the 'Wow' factor,'' he said. ''It's probably more like $12 million to $15 million.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is ''wow,'' and there is ''Wow!'' To Mr. Henckels, '' 'wow' with a small 'w' is $10 million to $20 million while capital 'W' 'Wow' is over $20 million.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wherever ''wow'' rests, it was certainly uttered more than once when word spread about a $45 million transaction -- the highest ever recorded in Manhattan -- in the AOL Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle. The purchase of a gargantuan (12,000 square feet) loft assembled by combining one entire floor and part of another there remains breathtaking, even for movie stars and corporate tycoons. The buyer was David Martinez, a London-based financier who made his fortune buying the debt of nations and companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he remains in a class by himself. As Stephen Kotler, executive vice president of Douglas Elliman, put it, ''There is no rash of $45 million buyers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there were, they might find some latitude on asking prices, which slipped noticeably in the upper reaches last fall, Mr. Miller said. But that was due more to overpricing, he said, than to real decline. ''List prices were being set as if the market were continuing to see double digit increases,'' he said. ''Now we are seeing prices at this level remaining flat, but there is a modest uptick in the number of transactions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a good inventory of properties for people able to bid $10 million or more. Mr. Kotler conducted an informal online survey of $10-million-plus apartments last week. Above that cutoff, he said, ''our database shows there are 144 available apartments, with an average asking price of $16,286,000 for an average of $2,680 per square foot. The average square footage of these units is 6,100.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(A survey done by Mr. Miller for Douglas Elliman shows the average sales price in Manhattan over all for the second quarter of 2003 at $660 a square foot.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some specialists believe that price per square foot is a more sensitive barometer of high-end luxury than absolute price. ''At $1,000 per square foot, you get something very nice; $1,500, something extravagant; and $2,000 plus, hotel quality service, concierges, parking, five-star restaurants with catering and usually premium addresses with views,'' said Bret Bobo, senior vice president of sales and marketing for the Athena Group, a development firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what can buyers crossing the $10-million-and-up threshold expect to get that they would not for a single-digit million? ''Five million dollars or $6 million can buy you a great location, a terrific apartment, a beautiful home, but they are not palaces,'' said Hall F. Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens Residential Sales. ''It's like the difference between buying a Mercedes versus a Rolls-Royce.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, Ms. Kleier said, ''What you're getting is more space, larger rooms, higher ceilings and views. If you're buying at Trump World Tower or the AOL Time Warner building and you're spending that kind of money, you won't buy on the 15th floor but on the 70th. You want to walk in and have drop-dead airplane views. If you are buying in a prewar co-op,'' she said, ''you will be getting something that will never be built again, an Old World building with snob appeal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter how unique any particular residence may be, real estate specialists agree that there are three essential factors in catapulting a property into the megamillion range:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*View.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The way those factors balance one another is different for stately old co-ops (for which location, and all that it implies, is paramount) than they are for glamorous new condos (views are essential). For town houses, width -- more than 20 feet -- dominates all other considerations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cliché though it may be, there seems no way to overstate the pull of location, especially in the co-op sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive -- and exclusive -- buildings sit on Fifth and Park Avenues from 59th to 96th Streets. Although there are certainly other neighborhoods and streets with prestige, like Sutton and Beekman Places, Central Park South, Central Park West and Gramercy Park, none command quite the same cachet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buildings on Fifth and Park are known simply by their numbers. ''People don't say '740 Park Avenue,' they just say '740' and no one asks '740 what?' '' Ms. Kleier said. ''Everyone knows you are worth a billion dollars or you wouldn't get through the board. It is the prestige of having that address on your stationery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though many consider Central Park West to be as desirable as Fifth and Park, ''there are not as many really expensive apartments there,'' said Dolly Lenz, executive vice president of Douglas Elliman. ''For the most part, you only get humongous apartments when they are combined. On the East Side, they were built huge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the town house market, the gap in prices between East and West Sides has been narrowing in recent years. ''But they are still 25 percent higher on the Upper East Side blocks between Fifth and Madison,'' said Jed Garfield, the managing partner at Leslie J. Garfield &amp; Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, to be sure, some multimillion dollar properties downtown as well, but not in the concentration of the Upper East Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it takes more than a high-status address to escalate prices. ''It must be an apartment in a very fine building,'' said Kathy Sloane, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens, ''fine being defined as address, original architect and designer and provenance, meaning the people who have lived there. If the building is by Rosario Candela or James Carpenter, you know it will have certain ceiling heights, a scale that creates a sense of graciousness, sufficient attention to areas for servants, a very fine lobby and a handsome exterior and possibly a terrace.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Mr. Kotler, size is paramount. ''You can get something as nice for $6 million or $7 million with the same level of finishes, but the difference comes down to size.'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent buzz around Fifth and Park concerned the contract reportedly signed for the duplex at 770 Park Avenue owned by Giovanni Agnelli, the chairman of Fiat and elder statesman of Italian business, who died in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is not big, 6,000 feet, but it is one of the best apartments in New York,'' said Alice Mason, a broker who was not involved in the sale. ''There were 22 appointments to see it the first week it came on the market.'' <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span>, the brokerage firm handling the sale, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the duplex is rumored to have gone for $20 million, ''in that same building you can find something for $6 million,'' said Roger Erickson, senior managing director of William B. May. ''They share a location. What they don't share is the location within the building and that, along with size, is the key factor that vaults you to $15 million.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that the stately prewar co-op buildings, particularly those by revered architects like Candela and Carpenter, cannot be expanded or duplicated, adds to their mystique and their value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't replace the prewar buildings on Park that were built in the 1920's,'' Ms. Mason said. ''The location is 100 percent gone and the type of craftsmanship used in the old buildings no longer exists.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what makes the building at 838 Fifth Avenue, at 65th Street, unusual. Known as the ''Love Thy Neighbor'' building for the biblical injunction carved into its limestone facade for its previous owner, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, it is both a condo in a sea of co-ops, and a gut renovation. (According to Lawrence Sicular, director of appraisal and consulting for Brown Harris Stevens, there are 63 co-ops and five condos on Fifth Avenue between 59th and 96th Street.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the amenities at 838 Fifth, which commanded $10 million to $20 million per apartment: quarters on the ground floor for employees. ''With square footage so expensive upstairs, over a million per bedroom, it was decided that staff didn't have to live in the same apartment,'' Mr. Bobo said. ''So we put in one staff room for each floor, and they sold out at $500,000 each.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the residents house staff there, however. ''One owner put in a gym, another a wine cellar and storage,'' said Mr. Bobo, whose company converted the building to residential use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The differences between co-ops and condos, of course, range from the basic -- condominiums, like houses, are real property, while co-ops are corporations in which tenants own shares, with rules, and admission, in the hands of a board -- to the subtle. In Old World co-ops, ''there is a snobbery that no condo can have,'' Ms. Mason said. ''A condo is only about money, and these buildings are only partly about money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dolly Lenz, executive vice president and managing director of Douglas Elliman, disagreed. ''People used to think you were odd if you were a New Yorker and said you wanted to buy a condo,'' she said. ''Now, thanks to buildings like the Westbury at 15 East 69th Street and 838 Fifth Avenue, it is not just acceptable but preferable to be in a condo because of the incredible people who have bought there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultraluxury condominiums can also be found beyond -- in some cases well beyond -- traditionally affluent neighborhoods. They can even bestow a new identity on their locations, as the twin Richard Meier buildings, at 173 and 176 Perry Street where prices ranged from $1.6 million to $18 million, have done on Perry Street and One Beacon Court is expected to do on Lexington Avenue. At One Beacon Court, part of the development on the old Alexander's store site, prices will top out at $26 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some buildings make the location,'' Ms. Kleier said. ''Who would have thought people would be fighting to live on Columbus Circle?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To compete with co-ops, Mr. Sicular said, condos must offer newness and extraordinary services and amenities. ''Co-ops have personnel but not the bells-and-whistles amenities of pools and, with a few exceptions, in-house restaurants,'' he said. ''While many high end co-ops have views, many don't, and Park Avenue is a premier example of that. Condos tend to need a view.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be hard to find views more spectacular than those visible from the two behemoths soaring into the skyline across town from one another: the AOL Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle and One Beacon Court at 151 East 58th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in the AOL Time Warner Center start at $2.5 million (for a two-bedroom 1,283-square-foot unit facing west). The largest single sale there registered at $30 million. Though Mr. Martinez's purchase was for $45 million, he bought two units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The towers, one to be known, because of the hotel at its base, as the Residences at Mandarin Oriental (65 apartments) and the other as One Central Park (135 apartments), are equal in height to a building 80 stories tall but because of the unusually high ceilings, and the retail complex at their bases, they actually have only 55 floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is five star living, and money is no object,'' said Louise M. Sunshine, president of the real estate marketing company bearing her name. The developer has trademarked the phrase ''five star living.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE aim, Ms. Sunshine said, is to provide a remarkable array of services and facilities and be ready to fulfill any request, no matter how challenging. As the promotional literature breathlessly says, ''Discover how expectations are surpassed; whether it's 3,000 roses upon request or monogrammed pillow shams for your houseguests, here the comforts of home have been exquisitely elevated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ms. Lenz's opinion, ''If you are marketing a new building today and don't have really great services, it's a hard sell. ''People are purchasing lifestyle. They can afford everything and want everything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they get it at buildings like AOL Time Warner, One Beacon Court and the new <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> at 50 Central Park South. ''Any building can do maid service, but here they will dedicate the maid to your home,'' Ms. Lenz said of the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span>. ''If you want her, she must drop what she is doing. If there is a dog in residence, you get a dedicated dog walker who knows your dog.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are two Bentley limos available,'' she continued, ''and they have fractional ownership of a jet, so if you decide you want to go to Palm Beach for the weekend, you can do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for 11 floor-through apartments were initially set at $15 million to $26 million, but one floor was split into two units priced at $12 million and $17 million after construction began. ''We decided we wanted to be able to offer something below $15 million,'' said Matthew Hall, spokesman for <span class="companylink">Millennium Partners</span>, the developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only the 23rd floor has completely finished interiors, with the rest offered as raw space. ''At this price point, buyers want their own architects and interior designers,'' Mr. Hall said. ''If we put in the finishes, we would never select the right ones.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not unusual for buyers at this level to rip out kitchens and bathrooms and to redo finishes, but Donald Trump, who has put up some of the more opulent condos around town, said that purchasers tend to leave well enough alone in the kitchens of his Trump World Tower at 845 United Nations Plaza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an advertisement currently running in several magazines, Mr. Trump stands over a pizza in a box in a kitchen there equipped with G.E. Monogram appliances. The penthouse apartment is described as ''90th floor 10 rms w vu, New York at your feet $17 million.'' He is beaming as he holds out a slice. ''People very rarely tear out what I build,'' he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In town houses, services are virtually nonexistent and high end finishes may be attractive, but they do not have much impact on prices, according to Mr. Garfield, who said, ''There is not much difference between what you get for $8 million or $9 million and $15 million or $16 million. You can only spend so much on a house. There is no such thing as a Viking Plus range; a Viking is a Viking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does count is easier to quantify: width. ''Twenty feet is standard,'' Mr. Garfield said. ''There are lots of buildings at 15, 18, 19 feet, but once you break the 20-foot barrier, you start moving up disproportionately. Plenty of multimillionaires have 20 feet but not many have 22 or 25.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the extravagance of luxuries offered, at some point they become irrelevant. As Ms. Sunshine put it, ''They are for the $3 million to $10 million buyer, not the $45 million buyer. Those people come with their own luxuries. They have their own major-domos, drivers, concierges. If they want to exercise they put in their own gyms, but they still want to know that the building's gym is there.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state's Council on Affordable Housing proposed new rules last week intended to make it easier for municipalities to provide low- and moderate-income housing. Under the old system, each community had to have a fair share of lower-priced housing based on a complicated formula that many town officials criticized as cumbersome and developers used as a wedge to build large, dense housing complexes. Under the new rules, towns would have to require one new lower-priced unit for every 10 housing units built, and one unit for every 30 jobs created by new commercial construction. Critics questioned whether the new rules would have the desired effect or would result in keeping the poor and minorities in cities. They complained that the new rules allow towns that are not growing to avoid providing low- and moderate-income housing. Critics also complained that the rules doubled the number of units that could be set aside for the elderly, from 25 percent to 50 percent. George James  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS house prices on Long Island have soared, the starter home has become a thing of the past. So has the starter condominium. All that is left, housing experts say, is co-ops.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Attached homes are the only viable first homes for entry-level workers,'' said Jim Morgo, president of the Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit group based in Hauppauge. Condos, town houses and co-ops all used to be affordable, he said. Now only co-ops are.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the entry-level buyer, someone who is just starting their first job or buying their first house, the general rule for purchase is not to spend more than two and a half times the gross family income,'' or perhaps three times the income when interest rates are extraordinarily low, Mr. Morgo said. ''The median entry-level income for one person on Long Island is $56,000. You figure that for someone just starting a job the median could be $40,000, so they should not buy a house costing more than $120,000.'' Even the buyer earning $56,000 would in theory be able to afford a home costing no more than $168,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, the median closing price for a home in Nassau in July was $400,000 and in Suffolk, $322,000. These prices reflect annual increases of more than 10 percent. A year earlier, the median in Nassau was $355,000, and in Suffolk, $273,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of co-ops have increased as well, and the number sold has also grown sharply, with sales already past last year's total.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2003 through Aug. 1, 397 one-bedroom co-op units were sold in Nassau, with a median price of $172,000. In Suffolk, 154 co-op units were sold; the median price was $93,500. For all of last year, 343 one-bedroom units were sold in Nassau, with a median price of $149,000. In Suffolk, a total of 144 co-op units were sold with a median of $77,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents say that in general condos, which are typically newer and have more amenities, sell for about 50 percent more than co-ops.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As the market went up so have all types of housing,'' said Joseph Mottola, chief executive of the West Babylon-based Listing Service. ''Condos are traditionally priced higher than co-ops, and what is low end is always low end. What has changed is the definition of affordable housing. Co-ops generally are lower in price and affordable to whatever the market is. The prices today were unthinkable 10 years ago. The prices are still inching up to show what demand is there.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-ops have always been the least expensive housing ''because of the type of ownership, in common with everyone else in the building,'' Mr. Morgo said. With a condominium, people own their own unit and pay real estate taxes; with a co-op, residents own shares in a corporation and the corporation pays the real estate taxes. A percentage of the monthly maintenance charge in a co-op is almost always tax deductible to reflect the corporate real-estate tax payments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-ops are mainly converted rental apartments, said Roy Fedelem, the principal planner at the Suffolk County Planning Department. On Long Island, most conversions occurred in the early 1980's, he said, ''partly for financial reasons -- to give the owners of the building and the units some type of equity.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The buildings were old and had high carrying costs,'' he said. ''The interest rates were high at the time -- 12 to 19 percent -- and instead of refinancing an apartment the owner often converted to a co-op. In other words, he would sell in order to renovate.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to statistics provided by Peter Lambert, a senior planner for the county, 44 apartment complexes -- a total of 6,182 units -- were converted to co-ops in the 1980's in Suffolk's six western towns. In Nassau, a small number of conversions began in the 1960's and 1970's, but the majority -- 137 complexes with a total of 15,327 units -- were converted during the 1980's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INCLUDING those built specifically as co-ops, there are now nearly 30,000 units on Long Island: 20,111 in Nassau and 9,644 in Suffolk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fairfield Properties, based in Commack, which manages 15 co-op complexes with a total of 2,000 units on Long Island, was one of the first to convert rental apartments to co-ops in Suffolk. In 1982, Fairfield bought and renovated an apartment complex in Nesconset that had been built in 1970 and created 36 co-op units called Smithwood.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company bought seven additional rental properties, with about 800 units, for conversion in the 1980's, according to Mark A. Broxmeyer, the company's founder and a principal with his son, Michael, and brother, Gary.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We found the values of apartments were going up, but rents were not keeping pace, so it didn't pay to keep them as rentals,'' Mark Broxmeyer said. ''Some of them were in deplorable condition.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the 1990's, when the economy changed and real estate went down, the co-op market was hit hard,'' he said. ''We had foreseen what was going to happen and had taken all the prospective co-op units off the market in the late 1980's. We kept them as rentals while we waited for the market to turn around. About two years ago it did, and we put the units back on the market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, 200 of the 250 units that had been held back as rentals have been sold, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Suffolk, co-op prices range from $80,000 to $140,000 for a small one-bedroom to $110,000 to $150,000 for a two-bedroom and $199,000 for a three-bedroom, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To illustrate what he called the ''humongous increase'' in co-op prices in the past few years, Michael Broxmeyer cited a 30-year-old 248-unit co-op complex in Patchogue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''About five years ago, a one-bedroom had foreclosed for nonpayment of maintenance fees, and someone bought it for $10,000,'' Mr. Broxmeyer said. ''This year, he went to contract on the unit for $133,000.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large proportion of Nassau's co-ops are in Great Neck and Long Beach, which have a heavy concentration of apartment houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Great Neck, 45 of the 60 apartment buildings are co-ops, according to Ellen Steinberg-Finkelstein, who specializes in co-op sales at Trylon Realty. ''The co-ops sell immediately,'' she said. ''Rentals and some condos, depending on the area, are very expensive.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rentals in the Great Neck area range from $1,650 to $2,200 a month and condos sell for $700,000 to more than $1 million for a two-bedroom, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-ops sell from $75,000 to $130,000 for a studio; $140,000 to more than $500,000 for a one-bedroom; and $240,000 to $575,000 for a two-bedroom. Monthly maintenance charges range from $250 to $1,800. Ten years ago co-ops ranged from $40,000 to $160,000 for a one-bedroom unit, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Co-ops are popular with two types of buyers in Great Neck,'' said Lee Rothleder, president of the Long Island division of Goodstein Realty, a 76-year-old Manhattan company with three offices in Nassau -- two in Great Neck and one in Roslyn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because of the 26-minute easy commute to Manhattan, the many co-ops near the Long Island Rail Road station in Great Neck Plaza attract the young couples with a new job that are just starting out,'' she said. ''We also see a huge amount of empty nesters who have just sold their home and are attracted by easy walking to the downtown, good parking at their buildings and our many parks.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses in Great Neck range from $550,000 for a small three-bedroom to over $10 million for a large house on the waterfront. A one-bedroom condo starts at $300,000 and could run over $1 million, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joan Tramuta, a sales agent at the Plainview office of Prudential Douglas Elliman Realty, said: ''Before inflation you couldn't give a co-op away. Now with condos selling for up to 50 percent more than a co-op, they have become very popular and are considered affordable.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The co-ops go so fast, there are just not enough of them to sell,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tramuta noted that at Crest Wood Apartments in Bethpage -- a co-op that had once been a rental complex -- the asking price for a large one-bedroom apartment with a ''nice eat-in kitchen'' and an $842 monthly maintenance charge was $179,000. Within two days there had been multiple bids and the owner was offered $180,000.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Prices Climb Amid Record Sales of Homes  </span>
</div><div>By Bloomberg News</div>
<div>559 words</div><div>26 August 2003</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2003 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose to a record in July and prices recorded the biggest 12-month gain in almost 23 years, an industry report indicated yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales totaled 6.12 million at an annual pace, up 5 percent from June's 5.83 million pace and the third increase in the last four months, the report from the National Association of Realtors said. The increase was spurred by interest rates that in June had fallen to a low point in recent years. Economists had expected a 5.9-million-unit pace of home resales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have since risen, which may restrain home sales later this year and limit housing's contribution to economic recovery, economists said. While a rise of one percentage point in the average 30-year fixed rate since June may keep sales from strengthening, an accelerating economy will underpin the market for homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's likely that we have hit the peak,'' said Van Davis, president and chief executive of the Century 21 Real Estate Corporation. ''The good news is that I don't see a significant slowdown. The economy is picking up, real wages are rising and interest rates are still low, and in that environment,'' housing will not slump.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales are typically counted when the transactions close, meaning that the July statistics probably reflected buying decisions made a month or two earlier. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage reached 5.94 percent in July after falling in June to 5.21 percent, the lowest since the big mortgage buyer Freddie Mac started keeping records in 1971.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lowest recorded 30-year rate was 5.83 percent in 1965, according to the Federal Housing Finance Board, which has figures back to 1963.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buying has related economic benefits, spurring purchases of costly items like furniture and appliances.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, resales rose 7.7 percent in the Northeast, to a 700,000-unit annual pace; 3.9 percent in the Midwest, to a pace of 1.34 million units; 7 percent in the South, to a 2.45-million-unit pace; and 1.9 percent in the West, to a pace of 1.63 million units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a home rose 4.1 percent last month, to $182,100 from $175,000 in June, and more than 12 percent above the levels of July 2002. That was the biggest 12-month increase since November 1980. David Lereah, chief economist at the Realtors' association, said he expected the rise in home prices to slow to a range of 4 percent to 5 percent over the next 12 months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available at the current sales pace fell to 4.7 months' worth in July from a 5.1-month supply in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously owned homes account for 85 percent of the residential real estate market, and new homes the rest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department today will release statistics on new-home sales in July. Economists said these sales probably slipped to a 1.15 million annual pace after a record 1.16 million a month earlier.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Housing Starts Hit 17-Year High in July  </span>
</div><div>By Bloomberg News</div>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts on new homes unexpectedly surged last month to the highest level in 17 years, a new report shows, providing further evidence that housing remains remarkably robust.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders started work on 1.872 million homes at an annual rate in July, a 1.5 percent increase from June and the most since 1.933 million in April 1986, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Mortgage rates that have risen more than a percentage point over the last month have not discouraged buyers, construction company executives said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We see in our markets a high degree of traffic and optimism,'' said Laurence Hirsch, the chairman and chief executive of the Centex Corporation, a Dallas-based home builder.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Commerce Department report also showed that building permits, an indicator of future production, fell 2.4 percent last month to 1.78 million, from 1.823 million a month ago. The drop in building permits was led by authorizations for multifamily projects, which declined 9.8 percent in July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And consumer confidence might not be quite as strong as previously thought. The University of Michigan's closely watched sentiment index fell to 90.2 in August, from 90.9 in July. A drop in Americans' perception of their financial situation tempered sentiment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Michigan university's current conditions index decreased to 100.5 this month from 102.1 in July. That largely reflected a drop in expectations for wage increases and concern about higher gasoline prices in the summer driving season, people with access to the survey said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the University of Michigan survey, released on Friday, showed an increase of more than 10 points since the end of the Iraq war.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing report showed that starts of single-family homes rose 1.9 percent in July to a rate of 1.521 million units, the highest since 1.525 million in November 1978. Starts of multifamily homes declined 0.6 percent to an annual rate of 351,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family permits edged down 0.3 percent, to a 1.423 million annual rate from June, which had the highest pace since 1960.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have reported a rise in demand even as mortgage rates rose from June's record low of 5.21 percent. The rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rose as high as 6.34 percent in early August, according to Freddie Mac, the nation's second-largest mortgage buyer.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Price of Single-Family Home Up Almost 10% in Year  </span>
</div><div class="author">By ELSA BRENNER  </div><div>1357 words</div><div>10 August 2003</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2003 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE median price of a single-family home in Westchester reached $570,000 at the end of the second quarter -- up almost 10 percent from a year earlier and close to the highest level ever in the county, according to a report from the Multiple Listing Service. The record, $570,750, was set in the third quarter of last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In large part, the prices for single-family homes are being driven up by a lack of inventory, a persistent problem for several years, according to the listing service, a subsidiary of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. The single-family housing stock peaked at 6,699 homes on the market in 1995. The figure fell to a low of 2,296 in 2001 and has edged up since then.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although inventory by the end of the second quarter was up almost 25 percent from a year earlier, to 3,243 homes from 2,602, it was still not enough to meet demand, real estate agents said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Very low mortgage interest rates helped to fuel demand for homes, in spite of the sluggish state of the national and state economies in early 2003 (the period that generated the second quarter's closed transactions), the report also said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the dearth of housing stock, especially in the middle range, ''homes listed in the $500,000's and $600,000's are getting snapped up in bidding wars,'' said Nicholas Wolff, the owner of Century 21 Wolff in White Plains. He mentioned a White Plains four-bedroom, two-bath Tudor on a 50-by-100-foot lot that was listed in mid-July for $539,000. It had an accepted offer of $555,000 within a week, Mr. Wolff said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Pleasantville, a four-bedroom, two-bath ranch on 1.81 acres that came on the market last week for $629,000 had four offers within 24 hours, said Donna Conte, the manager for Holmes &amp; Kennedy's Pleasantville office.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Especially with the economy sluggish and people losing jobs, buyers are more reluctant to spend a lot, to overextend themselves,'' Ms. Conte said. ''That's another reason houses in middle range are at a premium.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, houses at the high end -- in the $800,000's and $900,000's in White Plains and $1 million and above in northern Westchester -- are taking longer to sell.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are currently 187 homes available at $1 million to $2 million in northern Westchester (New Castle, North Castle, Bedford, Lewisboro, Somers, North Salem, Mount Kisco and Pound Ridge), according to the listing service. Fifty-four of them have had their prices cut since going on the market, said Roselyn Harburger, branch manager for Houlihan/Lawrence's Katonah office. ''In this price range, buyers now have more opportunity and choices than in the past,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major concern among brokers and sales agents is that Westchester's high prices for single-family homes have encouraged potential buyers to look in Putnam County to the north, Mrs. Harburger added. The median price of a single family-home in Putnam was $355,000 at the end of the second quarter -- ''what it was in Westchester in the second quarter of 1999,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OR as Ms. Conte at Holmes &amp; Kennedy explained, ''Lots of buyers, even those looking at the low end of Westchester's market, are saying, 'Wait a minute; I can't spend that much.' '' Even with low interest rates, the down payment is often an obstacle, especially for first-time buyers, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least in the southern part of the county, though, buyers still seem willing and able to pay the high prices, especially if they need to be within close commuting distance of New York City, said Liz Lindsey, manager of Houlihan/Lawrence's Bronxville office. ''If they must have Manhattan, they'll stay in the county,'' she said. ''I'm not saying that at some point, we won't see more home buyers moving farther away from the city, but that's not happening as of now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflecting the low inventory and high prices, the number of closed sales for single-family homes in Westchester dropped 19 percent in the quarter, to 1,165, from 1,444 a year ago, according to the listing service. Similarly, the dollar volume of sales dropped by almost 13 percent, to $861.4 million, from $985.8 million in the second quarter of 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all residential categories (single-family houses, condominiums, co-ops and multifamily houses), there were 2,041 closed sales in the quarter, down 12 percent from a year ago. The dollar volume of closed sales for all residences was $1.08 billion, down 8 percent from $1.18 billion a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only category that showed an increase in the number of sales was condos, up 4 percent, to 309, in the quarter from 298 a year ago. In dollar volume, condo sales were up 15 percent, co-op sales were up 10 percent and two- to five-family houses were up 5 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the quarter, the median sale price of a condo was up 11 percent, to $300,000, from $270,000 a year ago. The median sales price of a co-op was up 38 percent, to $131,000, from $95,000. And the median sales price of a two- to five-family house was up 28 percent, to $435,000, from $339,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the listing service's report, there appeared to be ''no sign at all through the second quarter that any sector of the Westchester-Putnam residential real estate market is resting upon a price bubble,'' despite the low inventory and high prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report added that even though interest rates had begun to creep up since the close of the second quarter, ''there is a very long distance to go before such increases become a problem.'' The average rate on a 30-year conventional mortgage was less than 6 percent and approached 5 percent in the first half of the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester was not alone when it came to inventory problems in the first half, according to Walter Molony, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors, a trade organization in Washington.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were more buyers than sellers across the country,'' he said. ''Usually, we see a six-month supply. For the past two years, it's been more like a four-and-a-half-month supply.'' The length of supply is determined by how long it will take to exhaust available inventory if houses continue to sell at their current pace, Mr. Molony said. The population -- in particular, the number of new households -- is growing faster than the supply, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the median sales price of a single-family home in the first quarter -- the most recent period for which the trade association had figures -- was $161,500, up 7 percent from a year ago. In Westchester in the first quarter, the median sales price was $525,500, up 12 percent from the first quarter of 2002. In the New York metropolitan area, the median sales price for a single-family home in the first quarter was $329,400, up 15.1 percent from a year ago, the association said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in an uncertain economy, residential real estate continues to be a good investment, Mr. Molony said. ''Housing is not a quick-in and quick-out kind of thing,'' he said. ''It's an investment that appreciates over time, usually at the rate of inflation plus one to two percentage points.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And just because housing prices aren't rising as fast as they were, there's no indication they're going to go south. Some temporary price corrections are always a possibility, but even that's not a likelihood.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices in Westchester and Putnum Counties continued to rise from a year ago, according to new data released last week by the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median selling price of a single-family house in Westchester climbed to $570,000 in the second quarter, a 9.6 percent increase in comparison to the same period last year. In Putnam, the median selling price for a single-family house was $355,000, a 25.4 percent jump from a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linda Lyons, a real estate agent with the White Plains branch of Prudential Rand Realty, said she and her colleagues often still receive multiple bids on houses below $1 million.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in the Hartford area are slowing, primarily because of sagging buyer interest in the least expensive houses on the market, an organization of real estate agents said. The Greater Hartford Association of Realtors reported 2,393 sales of single-family houses that had been priced below $200,000 for the first six months of the year, a drop of 24 percent since the first half of 2002.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brookhaven Town Board last week approved a six-month building moratorium on planned retirement communities and multi-family housing developments so the town can complete a study on high-density housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local civic leaders had been calling for a halt to such construction for more than a year, saying the town had approved too many high-density projects in recent years without first developing a town-wide land use plan for them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lorraine Dittko, a member of the Manorville-East Moriches Civic Association, said the southeastern corner of the town had been particularly hard hit by the high-density developments because it has the most remaining open space. She said eight planned retirement communities had been approved within a three-mile radius of Center Moriches in recent years, despite hamlet studies that recommended those areas be zoned for single-family homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local builders and developers spoke out against the moratorium at a public hearing last week and persuaded the town board to consider amending it to allow projects that have received approval within the last two years but have not yet started construction to go forward during the moratorium period.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert A. Wieboldt, the executive vice president of the Long Island Builders Institute, said, ''The town is facing a phenomenal need for senior housing and multi-family housing, but it's getting a lot of resistance to these projects.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Town officials said the moratorium would affect applications for projects that could create as many as 15,000 new housing units in the town. Mr. Wieboldt said that only about 4,500 of those proposed units are really at risk because ''some of the proposals are just pipe dreams,'' but added that the number of stalled units would cost the town roughly 4,500 jobs. ''It's going to be a major economic loss for the town, and it will create a big hole in production in 2004,'' he said. Vivian S. Toy  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of existing single-family homes were solidly higher last month in all of the city's suburbs in New York State, compared with June 2002, according to the New York State Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, the median sales price in Nassau County rose to $390,000 from $340,000, a 14.7 percent increase, and the price in Suffolk County rose to $308,000 from $275,000, an increase of 12 percent. In Westchester County, the median rose to $599,000 from $555,000 for a 7.9 percent gain. In Rockland County, the median rose to $341,500 from $321,000, or 6.4 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey contained figures for only two New York City boroughs. In Queens, the median sales price for June was $355,000, up from $306,000 a year previously, a gain of 16 percent, while prices in Staten Island rose 11 percent, to $291,000 from $262,250.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the statewide median selling price in June increased 18.5 percent, to $196,750 from the $166,000 in June 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of sales last month, however, 8,163, was 10.8 percent lower than June 2002, when 9,147 homes were sold, although sales were up 16.2 percent from May, when 7,027 homes were sold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing sales are continuing to grow on a monthly basis as we move into the typically strong summer selling,'' said Charles M. Staro, the association's chief executive. ''This continued growth at a sustainable level bodes well, especially as favorable market conditions, such as low mortgage rates, persist.''  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Despite a Sluggish City Economy, Apartment Prices Up in Manhattan   </span>
</div><div class="author">By MOTOKO RICH   </div><div>705 words</div><div>16 July 2003</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2003 New York Times Company   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two consecutive quarters of decline, the average sales price of apartments in Manhattan rose 11 percent, to $864,860, in the second three months of the year despite a sluggish economy, according to a report released yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the increase is nowhere near the 29 percent rise in the average sales price that occurred in the first three months of 2000, it suggests that the Manhattan real estate market is being buoyed by low-interest mortgages and growing consumer confidence.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's partly attributable to a longer-term confidence and a light at the end of the tunnel about the economy,'' said Jonathan Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc. and the author of the report, the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Overview. ''While economic conditions certainly aren't robust, they appear to be getting a little bit better.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price, which increased to $575,000, almost 12 percent more than the median for the previous quarter and almost 13 percent more than the median for the period a year ago, was at its highest level since the first market overview report was issued in 1989. (The median price is midway between the highest and lowest prices.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average and the median sales prices of cooperative apartments were at record highs, with the average up almost 9 percent to $775,052 from the first quarter this year, and the median price at $479,000, also an increase of almost 9 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Kelleher, a director of sales at Douglas Elliman, said the increases belied a general perception about the market. ''Everybody says it's such a strong buyers' market,'' Mr. Kelleher said. ''They may have more choices, but I don't think they're getting reduced prices.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Steven L. James, sales director in Elliman's East Side office, said he was seeing bidding wars again. ''I'm amazed,'' Mr. James said, adding that his office recently sold a four-bedroom cooperative apartment in the East 70's off Park Avenue for $3.8 million after three people competing to buy it drove the price up from a listing price of $3.5 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The annual growth in the average price for all apartments was not as striking as the quarterly increase. The average sales price was up more than 4 percent over the average price for the same period last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applying a different measure, the Corcoran Group, which gathers data about signed contracts rather than closed sales, the method used in the Elliman report, said the average sales price actually declined slightly to $840,554 this year, from $872,907 last year. ''Last spring, buyers brought unabashed enthusiasm to the market, and overbidding was commonplace,'' said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of Corcoran. ''This spring has been a healthier market. While there are still certainly plenty of hot deals and bidding wars, on the whole the market is much more rational.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Liebman said Corcoran's agents had recently noted a resurgence in the market for apartments priced at $10 million or more.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Elliman report said sales for all apartments in the second quarter increased almost 11 percent, to 2,055, compared with sales in the first quarter, though that figure represented a decline of nearly 25 percent from the 2,726 apartments sold in the same quarter last year. Mr. Miller said the second quarter of 2002 was particularly strong, as buyers who held back after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks returned to the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets did see strong annual growth. Stephen Kliegerman, executive director of sales for the downtown office of Halstead Property L.L.C., said sales downtown increased about 15 percent in the second quarter compared with sales in the same period last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Elliman report said sales of two-bedroom apartments, about 45 percent of the total sold in the second quarter, were particularly strong, up more than 20 percent over sales in the first quarter. Though sales were down 24 percent from the period last year, Mr. Miller said, the market for two-bedroom apartments was much stronger than the market for studios.   </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Behind the Region's Run-Up in Prices  </span>
</div><div class="author">By JOSH BARBANEL  </div><div>3436 words</div><div>13 July 2003</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2003 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE value of homes in the New York metropolitan area has risen faster than homes in almost all other areas in the country for more than five years, providing a bounteous reward to anyone with the foresight or luck to already own a home, but raising questions about the impact of the high prices on home seekers and housing policies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the region, the median sale price of a single-family home has risen by 75 percent since 1998, an increase of more than $140,000, according to data collected by the National Association of Realtors. Across the country, prices have risen 26 percent in that time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of 139 separate geographic areas tracked in the price survey, the entire New York region ranked fifth in percentage gain. But Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island ranked first in the country during this period, with home prices nearly doubling; the median price of all homes sold in the two counties increased by $162,000, to $338,000. Long Island was followed by the Sacramento and San Diego areas, and then Monmouth and Ocean Counties along the Jersey shore. Bergen and Passaic Counties in northern New Jersey ranked ninth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times in recent years, there have been frenzied bidding wars, with houses selling within days if not hours after being placed on the market. But more recently, brokers say, price increases are moderating; supplies of homes for sale -- especially more expensive homes -- are increasing; and the market is becoming what brokers say is ''more balanced,'' albeit at the highest median prices ever.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The worst you can say about housing prices is that the rate of price increases is slowing,'' said Rae Rosen, a regional economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ''To me the continued price appreciation reflects the underlying strength of the economy in the metropolitan area. People are voting with their feet. They are saying we are staying here and paying premium prices to do so.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in prices here during a period of economic weakness is the product of many factors, both national -- notably, extraordinarily low interest rates -- and local, such as a slowing in the construction of new homes, especially moderately priced ones, and a critical lack of land for new home construction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, these trends raise concerns for some homeowners and home seekers. Will prices stagnate, and in some cases fall, as they did in much of the region in the early 1990's after a huge run-up in prices during the previous decade? Will young families today with average middle class incomes be able to afford homes in the region? What will happen if interest rates rise as high as they were a few years ago?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Patricia Green, a senior assistant dean in the Frank G. Zarb School of Business at Hofstra, the rising housing market worked out just right. After completing her doctorate in educational administration, she was recently hired as an associate dean at Ithaca College in upstate New York and it was time to sell the house she shared with her mother and two dogs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her father had purchased a Cape Cod home in the original Long Island Levittown in 1952 for $6,700; it was modestly expanded some time later, but the kitchen had never been updated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was put on the market for $299,990, a price her broker, Michael Litzner of Century 21 American Homes, thought would appeal to an entry-level home buyer with income of $80,000 to $100,000. The property attracted immediate interest, since more extensively remodeled Levittown homes cost upward of $100,000 more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The potential buyers ''were every age, every type of person,'' Dr. Green said. ''There were some single women, some couples with children, some without children, older people, a racial and ethnic mix. Some were moving from condos, some moving to be closer where they worked. I had five buyers on the weekend after Memorial Day, preapproved.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of Sunday, the house was sold for $300,000, $10 more than the asking price, enough to pay for a much larger house along Cayuga Lake in Ithaca with a mortgage with 5.2 percent interest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers in many parts of the region say $300,000 homes have gone the way of the 10-cent telephone call. And where homes in this price range are available, they sell quickly and are in short supply, while inventories of much higher-priced homes are rising.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For first-time buyers, the situation can be bleak. ''They call you and you feel bad for them,'' said Sharon Tucker of Tucker Associates GMAC Real Estate in West Nyack in Rockland County. ''They just got married, they are in the city and they have been renting. These homes are tough to find. You might be able to show them three or four homes, and their apartments are bigger.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ''decent little house'' in Nanuet is $375,000 to $380,000, she said. Instead, she suggests a condominium in Valley Cottage for $219,000 plus $350 in monthly maintenance and $4,500 in property taxes a year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years back in Clifton, N.J., Diana Bustamante of Keller Williams Team Realty sold a very nice, but small, Cape Cod house on Surrey Lane for $204,000 and, she recalled, ''people thought I was a miracle maker.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, she said, a similar two-bedroom Cape on Lyall Road, a few blocks away, is on the market for $289,000 in a neighborhood that attracts many first-time home buyers, frequently immigrants who had been living in New York City and Hudson County. To find a larger house with a driveway and a garage in a ''nice neighborhood'' is nearly impossible for less than $300,000, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are not enough properties on the market for the number of buyers out there,'' Ms. Bustamante said. ''Where were these buyers 10 years ago? We had too many houses and not enough buyers.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mercer County, John Burke, manager of the Gloria Nilson GMAC Real Estate office in Hamilton, said that though the number of multiple offers on properties had declined, they were still common. ''There are times that we scratch our heads trying to justify the prices,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Source of the Surge  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dramatic Impact Of Falling Rates  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The driving force behind the surge in prices here and across the country has been sharply falling mortgage interest rates, as the Federal Reserve Bank responded to the weakness in the economy by driving rates to their lowest levels in more than 30 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to overestimate the impact of these falling interest rates on the housing market. It was as if the Federal Reserve Bank had put tens of thousands of dollars in the pocket of nearly every home buyer in the country: every qualified buyer could get a larger loan, based on his or her income, at no extra cost.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage interest rates began rising in the late 1990's as the stock market took off and peaked in May 2000, at a monthly average of 8.52 percent for a 30-year mortgage, before falling to 5.23 percent last month, according to Freddie Mac.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A buyer who put down 20 percent in cash and who was willing to pay $2,000 a month in mortgage payments would have been able to afford a $325,000 house in the year 2000, but today would be able to afford a $454,000 house, a extra $129,000 or 40 percent, in purchasing power over a short period. Of course, the down payment would be almost $26,000 larger.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower interest rates enabled many homeowners to refinance their mortgages and either reduce payments or borrow more cash without increasing their monthly payments, or both. And even homeowners who did nothing saw their homes rise in value.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This extra purchasing power brought many thousands of new buyers into the home market. Others rushed to trade up. People who had never been able to qualify for mortgages suddenly were in the market. Prices rose, and across the country many more new homes were constructed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the tremendous wealth effect for those who owned homes provided some comfort in the face of stock market losses, including those in 401(k) retirement plans of people who did not otherwise dabble in the stock market, and protected the economy from a deeper recession.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effect of this can be seen in statistics that track the mortgage payments needed to support the median priced home in the metropolitan area. Despite sharp increases in these prices, the mortgage needed to support the typical home has risen far less, and after controlling for the cost of living has actually declined from the late 1980's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the year 2000, median prices in the New York area have increased 43 percent, but the monthly mortgage payment needed to carry that home increased only 14 percent, to $1,552, and only 7 percent after accounting for inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By June, when mortgage rates fell further, the mortgage on that same median house would have declined by $100 a month. Even more striking, since 1990 prices have increased by nearly 90 percent but mortgage payments have actually declined by 11 percent after accounting for inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York Region  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where Supply Is Lagging  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interest rate bounty does little to explain why housing prices are rising faster in the New York metropolitan area than elsewhere in the country. To economists, the answer can be summarized by a simple economic proposition: supply and demand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In much of the country, the supply of housing is expanding to meet the demand. In the New York region and in a few densely populated areas on both coasts that is not happening.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David A. Lereah, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said that the run-up in prices is not evidence of a ''bubble'' similar to the Internet stock market frenzy, but the functioning of a rational marketplace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The supply of homes is very, very lean in New York,'' he said. ''That is why you have such huge price appreciation. That is a healthy thing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that around New York construction of new homes has not kept pace with job creation over the last decade. ''Something has to give,'' he said, ''so prices go up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that over 10 years, one home has been created for every 1.6 jobs created nationally, but in the New York metropolitan area one home has been created for about every 16 new jobs. He estimated it would take an additional 269,007 homes in the New York area to meet the needs created by a decade of economic growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comparison between the New York region and the Atlanta metropolitan area, which leads the country in new home construction, is stark. In Atlanta, one single-family home building permit was issued for every 81 residents last year, compared with one for every 735 residents in the New York area, including suburban counties in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, according to the Census Bureau. When multifamily dwellings are included, the ratio shifts to one unit for every 61 residents of Atlanta, compared with one unit for every 378 in the New York region.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York area, analysts say, is running out of land for large housing developments. The new homes that are being built -- not infrequently by knocking down older homes -- are marketed to more affluent buyers of large homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a new home is built, it typically frees up an older, lower-priced home that is also put on the market. When fewer homes are built, this trickle-down effect is weaker. At the price range that many first-time homeowners can afford, there are few homes to be had.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael H. Schill, a law professor and director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University, worries that the ''smart growth'' movement in some New York suburbs, which seeks to protect open spaces and limit sprawl in outlying areas through restrictive zoning, is cutting into the supply of land for housing. In theory, high-density developments are supposed to compensate for land left undeveloped, but proposals for such developments are often fiercely resisted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you limit the amount of land that can be used for housing, there is no surer way of getting higher home prices,'' he said. ''It is transferring wealth from renters and people getting into the market to upper income people.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demand for lower priced homes may be so extreme and the supply so limited that it is distorting statistics in the New York area and perhaps exaggerating the median price increase, according to some housing analysts and appraisers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price data compiled by the National Association of Realtors is based mainly on prices at closings reported by local multiple listing services used by brokers across the country. It is the most current national housing price survey, although it excludes sales by owners and exclusive sales not reported to the listing services.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey G. Otteau, the president of the Otteau Appraisal Group, which publishes market reports for much of New Jersey, said the housing picture ''is not quite as optimistic'' as the closely followed median price figures suggest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the New Jersey Board of Realtors recently published figures showing continuing double-digit increases in median prices in Ocean and Monmouth Counties, he concluded that most of the houses sold were new homes in ''luxury price ranges,'' while more down-to-earth homes were hard to find. Thus, the median-price home, with half of all sales higher and half lower, moved upward.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most builders wish they could find land for lower priced homes, but municipalities don't want it,'' he said. ''The trend is that most are increasing their minimum lot size requirements.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He estimated, based on recent transactions, that the true price increases in New Jersey this year will be far lower than in recent years, closer to 5 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same pattern may hold in Westchester County, where 2,200 building permits were reported last year, including 1,049 for single-family homes. The new construction is barely enough to replace homes lost through fires and demolition, according to P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester, he said, inventory was up and sales were down, but, contrary to the usual functioning of supply and demand, median prices remain higher than ever.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Ellen Tolan, a broker in the Scarsdale office of Houlihan/Lawrence, said that inventory is rising for the most expensive properties, while there was little available at the lower end of the market, which in Scarsdale is $500,000 to $600,000. ''There is softness at anything over $2 million,'' she said. ''Sellers have been holding the line, but we are starting to see some compromise.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar pattern is evident in the Manhattan condominium and co-op market. Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal company, said that prices currently seem to be rising over levels of a year ago but that there was a quarter-to-quarter price decline in the first quarter of this year. In that period, prices of the properties in the highest 10 percent of the market fell more, by 11.5 percent, than the overall median, which declined by 1.9 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking Ahead  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weighing the Effects Of Increases in Rates  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what happens when mortgage interest rates stop falling and start to rise? Dr. James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, remembers the local real estate boom in the early 1980's, followed by years of static and even declining prices in the recession in the early 1990's, and says the current market is risky for anyone who buys now and needs to sell within a year or two.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although many economists forecast a modest rise in interest rates during the second half of this year, they say that it will probably have little effect on the housing market. If rates rise as part of a broad economic recovery, incomes will rise too, limiting the impact on home prices and values.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under this theory, buyers will then have to pay more each month to cover the cost of a new home purchase, but will have more income available. Unless the local economy hits some unexpected bumps, they say, the demand for homes by aging baby boomers and immigrant families will probably continue as well.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of inventory of moderately priced homes is having a ripple effect across the region.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Bronx, demand is keen but inventory low, according to Joseph F. Limongelli, a broker at Better Homes Realty and president of the Bronx-Manhattan North Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that homeowners in the East Bronx, Throgs Necks and surrounding areas are finding housing in the suburbs more expensive to buy and to own, because of higher taxes, and are staying in the Bronx. In Throgs Neck, a one-family row house is selling for about $310,000, and larger three-bedroom houses for $350,000. ''People are staying put rather than moving to the suburbs,'' he said. ''A lot of them are improving what they have and staying.''  </p>

</div><div class="author">By MOTOKO RICH  </div><div>1484 words</div><div>3 July 2003</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2003 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAST year, Jeff Holthaus, a 36-year-old engineer in Chicago, decided he was ready to settle down. But he had a commitment problem. Sure, he had his reasons. First, he had to figure out what he wanted. Then his company decided to move to Michigan, so he had to find a new job. And it wasn't always about him, either. In one case, he was the one who was rejected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in April, he thought he had found The One, until, at the last minute, he backed out of it: a two-bedroom condo in Bucktown, an up-and-coming neighborhood in Chicago. For Connie Grunwaldt, Mr. Holthaus's real estate agent, it was like watching a bridegroom run away from the altar.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He sent me over the edge,'' said Ms. Grunwaldt, who said she had showed Mr. Holthaus 92 apartments over the previous year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Holthaus, who finally signed a contract in May and moved into a two-bedroom, $271,000 apartment in the Old Town section of Chicago last weekend, said that because it was his first time buying a home, he was ''somewhat apprehensive and worried about having buyer's remorse.'' And having just gone through a job change, ''there was some nervousness due to the economy and the instability of the future.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He may be extreme, but Mr. Holthaus is not unique. According to Ms. Grunwaldt, buyers with the jitters are on the increase -- so much so that she is now writing up two contracts for every buyer, on average, compared with just one at the same time last year. The faltering is most evident, she said, among first-time buyers. ''They're thrilled with the fact that interest rates are low, and they're jumping on without thinking it through,'' she said. ''Then when they get into the process, they realize, 'Whoa!' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although interest rates are at 45-year lows and the housing market continues to zip along, real estate agents in many cities have noted the emergence of cold feet. Buyers are becoming confused by contradictory economic signals and worry that the housing market may have hit its peak.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For sellers, the hesitation can be more than irksome. David Lew, a 40-year-old investment banker in Manhattan, said that five different times since April, he thought he had sold his one-bedroom co-op apartment in Murray Hill. Each time, he accepted an offer and sent out a contract.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lew, who has already moved with his wife to a two-bedroom Midtown apartment they bought last summer, has been surprised by all the stumbles. ''It's contrary to what I had heard before I put my apartment on the market,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was reading that the one-bedroom market is holding up'' because of low interest rates, he added. ''But it's the intangibles, like 8 percent unemployment in New York and the economic uncertainty that has led to what's going on now. It's frustrating with all this last-minute disappointment.'' Mr. Lew said he had accepted the fifth offer a week ago, but yesterday his real estate agent, Daniel Ruiz of Brown Harris Stevens in Manhattan, said the buyer had backed out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ruiz said in an earlier interview that buyers are starting to perceive a shift in the market. ''There's this sense that people can walk away from things and there is plenty of other stuff on the market,'' he said. In May, he said, out of 14 accepted offers that his office handled, only 7 went to closing; in June, 8 out of 17 deals fell apart.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the San Francisco region, some real estate agents report a rise in the number of buyers pulling out of deals. Jeff Sterley, a broker with Pacific Union Residential Brokerage in suburban Greenbrae, Calif., said that 30 percent of accepted offers are now being broken, up from 20 percent a year ago and 10 percent three years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in New Jersey, Jay Schweppe, chief executive of Schweppe &amp; Company Realtors of Montclair, the number of deals that fall apart is up 50 percent since last year. ''When you put the pressure of a six-year run of appreciation, all of a sudden people are asking, 'Am I buying at the top of the marketplace?' '' Mr. Schweppe said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, it's not the buyers who are pulling out, but their bankers. In Brockton, Mass., near Boston, Stephen Damon, office manager of Jack Conway Real Estate, said three of his deals had fallen apart in the past month because the lenders decided at the last minute that the buyers' finances did not qualify them for a mortgage. ''When it comes down to the nitty-gritty, sundry things happen, and they're denied,'' Mr. Damon said. By now, the low interest rates have drawn most of the financially stable buyers into the market, and some with shakier credit histories are trying to sign up for mortgages.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, another deal-breaking factor is the co-op board. While many buyers can get a mortgage, they may not have the wherewithal to pass stringent board requirements.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carol Shainswit, a broker in the Midtown office of the Corcoran Group, said she is representing the seller of a three-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side who has had to turn away three offers because the buyers were unlikely to pass muster in the building.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, many brokers report that co-op boards have gotten tougher over the past year or two and that rejections are up. ''Buildings pull up the gangplank when they're worried that the financial environment is touchy,'' said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Associates in Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some boards are asking for liquid assets that are two or three times the purchase price of the apartment. Evelyn Cole, a broker at Stribling &amp; Associates, said that some Upper West Side buildings were raising their requirements for the cash portion of a deal to 35 percent, from 25.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate markets are by no means collapsing. In May, the last month for which figures are available, sales of existing homes rose to 5.92 million units, 4.4 percent more than in May of last year, according to the National Association of Realtors in Washington. Historically low mortgage rates continue to drive the market, and in many areas, properties favored by entry-level buyers are still generating bidding wars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while many first-time buyers are driven by the attractive trade-off between rents and mortgage payments, buyers hoping to move to larger homes are frightened by the shaky economic recovery.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last month, for example, the owners of a three-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side thought they had sold the unit for $2.7 million when the buyers, a couple with three children who wanted a bigger place, decided to pull out. Peter Marra, president of the William B. May real estate agency, said the husband called and said: ''You know what, a couple of guys in my department were let go, and I'm concerned. This is a big commitment, so I'm just going to stay where I am for a while.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Hyde, a 61-year-old retired advertising executive in northern California, said such jitteriness nearly drove him mad when he sold his family's home recently. By the time he moved out of the house this week, three separate would-be buyers had tied it up in escrow for several weeks each before pulling out of the deals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each time he received an offer for the place, a three-bedroom secluded wood house in the San Rafael hills that he had owned for 19 years, he asked to meet the buyers and show them around the property.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a pleasure for me to meet the next owner of my house,'' Mr. Hyde said. But after three failed deals, he said, ''it got to the point where I would have sold it to bin Laden.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of course,'' he added, ''I would have turned him in.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, Mr. Hyde sold the house to a divorced man for $1.18 million, down from an original asking price of $1.25 million. This time, Mr. Hyde stayed out of the process. As he put it, ''I felt I was in a position where I had to lower the price, be flexible, keep my mouth shut and stay out of the way.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $500 million housing and commercial development proposed for the site of the Garden State Park racetrack in Cherry Hill will begin construction this summer with the settlement of a two-year court battle over the number of affordable housing units in the project.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judge Theodore Z. Davis of Superior Court signed an agreement last week that gives Florida-based Turnberry Cherry Hill LLC permission to build 1,659 housing units, including 285 for low- and moderate-income families, said Rick Ochab, a spokesman for the developer. The complex also will include 582 units for people 55 and older, as well as several retail businesses.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OH, what a beautiful spring, comes the chorus from home sellers. While the rain never seemed to stop falling, prices went as high as an elephant's eye in many suburbs and some say they will keep climbing way up the sky.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, perhaps that is putting a bit of extra gloss on realtors' unstintingly upbeat views of the New Jersey home market. There is, many of them will concede, a cloud or two on the horizon when it comes to sales of the most expensive homes. But real estate professionals agree the trend in sales prices continues upward for homes with asking prices below about $700,000 -- at least in communities with short commutes to Manhattan, at least while interest rates remain at record lows.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had 15 percent appreciation in sales prices across the board for homes we listed and sold last year,'' said Pat Hoferkamp, president of Burgdorff ERA. ''This year, to date, we've again had 15 percent appreciation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She noted that Burgdorff has 23 offices in towns along commuter train lines in northern New Jersey, which makes them ''very desirable communities.'' Still, 30 percent appreciation is robust any way you look at it, Mrs. Hoferkamp said, and she sees no signs of slackening.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and other residential brokers said they perceived no price bubble that will abruptly burst -- even in towns where prices seem to have floated to the stratosphere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN Montclair, where last year one home got 22 offers and sold for $298,000 -- or 42 percent -- over the asking price, the average offer is running 5 to 10 percent over asking price this spring, according to local realtors, and bidding wars seem to have become virtually part of the landscape.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last weekend, the Sunday open houses were mobbed as usual, for homes ranging from a restored and upgraded Craftsman colonial offered at $1.4 million to a spiffed-up three-bedroom Dutch colonial on the market for $429,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A three-bedroom, one-bath home across the street from the Dutch colonial -- virtually untouched for approximately 50 years, and being sold on behalf of its 91-year-old owner with no marketing other than a sign -- garnered four offers the weekend before. It sold for $366,000 -- 8 percent over the asking price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burgdorff ERA's Montclair office manager, Carolee Jones, said there were 13 immediate offers on another home in the same Upper Montclair neighborhood, with the top bidder offering $150,000 over the asking price for a house that had been listed at more than $500,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the rapid appreciation can continue indefinitely,'' said Coldwell Banker's Montclair office manager, Robert W. Norman, ''primarily because interest rates are so low.'' Mr. Norman said that based on typical mortgage computations, buyers who could afford to pay $1,800 a month on a 30-year mortgage loan would have been able to afford a $450,000 house two years ago -- and now, with interest rates a percentage point lower, could afford a $600,000 house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montclair was one of four New Jersey towns listed this month by Money magazine as being among places in the nation where median home values have increased the most in the last five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis performed by a consultant for the magazine said the median value of homes increased 102.5 percent in that period in Montclair, 102.9 percent in the shore town of Rumson, 92.7 percent in Glen Ridge -- which borders Montclair -- and 92.5 percent in Palisades Park.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Jacelyn Botti, president of Weichert Realtors, the largest residential firm in the state, observed that five-year figures never reflect what is happening right now, which is, as she sees it, this: ''Prices are increasing more rapidly in the most affordable markets, and the rate of appreciation is beginning to slow in average and median price homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can take communities and neighborhoods with the lowest household prices in an area or a town, and they are still experiencing the highest rate of appreciation,'' she said. ''The average and median home sale prices are being impacted by an extremely soft upper-end market, for homes priced at $2 million-plus.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Rumson, where median home prices rose to $493,500 at the beginning of this year, the high-end market has slowed somewhat, said Coldwell Banker's office manager, Bob Kievit, who is also the president-elect of the New Jersey Association of Realtors. ''Anything in decent condition priced around $500,000 is not going to last,'' Mr. Kievit said, ''but homes selling for a million dollars and up are now taking a few months to sell, and prices are a bit lower than they would have been six months to a year ago.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slower market for the highest priced homes is true across the state and actually began more than two years ago with the decline of the stock market and the halt in production of ''under-30 millionaires,'' according to Jeffrey G. Otteau, who runs a New Jersey home appraisal consultancy bearing his last name. The average age of buyers in the $1 million-and-up range has gone up by about 10 years in the last couple of years, Mr. Otteau said, adding that the statement was based on information gleaned by regularly polling sales agents of newly constructed homes. ''Buyers in the older age range are much more cautious,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowing in the upper end market began at a time when the overall market was still ''very very tight,'' he said -- meaning there were many more buyers than homes available. ''But it takes a couple of years of that to see an effect on price,'' said Mr. Otteau. ''Remember that in the 1980's, when we last saw a price correction, the market began to weaken observably in '86-'87, but it was not until '89 that the supply of homes for sale swelled to the point where we saw an effect on price.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Botti of Weichert agreed with other residential specialists that there are pockets where the market continues to be ''extremely strong,'' with price appreciation of 20 percent or more. ''In those markets, there is still lack of inventory for the eight-four-two colonial,'' she said, meaning a limited number of ever-popular eight-room houses with four bedrooms and two baths.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, Ms. Botti said, based on the statistics Weichert keeps -- and the multiple listing services and other numbers she is privy to -- the number of homes for sale across the state is sharply up. ''I haven't seen listing inventory levels of this size for three and a half to four years,'' she said. ''We see houses staying on the market longer, and more of them are 'expiring,' '' she said, meaning that sales agents are unable to broker a sale within the time span of a sales contract, typically six months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and others attributed this in part to the impact of the spate of reports about rising prices, with those reports causing more and more homeowners to put homes on the market, which will inevitably lead it to slow down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau added that many baby boomer homeowners are putting homes on the market because they have decided it is time to downsize or migrate full-time to the Jersey shore.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the hottest markets in the state -- those with direct commuter service to Manhattan or quick access to the shore or both -- sales agents said that the heat radiates out from any particular town's boundaries. For example, a renovated three-bedroom home on Parkview Drive in Bloomfield near Brookdale Park, which straddles Montclair's border with Bloomfield, was sold in March for $509,000 -- $110,000, and 32 percent, over the asking price -- no longer shocking in Montclair, but a first for Bloomfield, as best area realtors said they can recall.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kievit said he bought a modestly priced house in a town near Rumson and has seen its value rise on a pace with Rumson's. ''Little tiny homes in Ocean Beach -- 600 square feet, on 50 by 30 foot properties -- are selling for $250,000 to $300,000 right now,'' he said  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where might it all end? Some buyers are beginning to sour on the auction atmosphere in the Montclair market, various realtors said, and are turning to other towns in the area. ''That's a big reason why we see the big hike in appreciation in Glen Ridge,'' Mrs. Hoferkamp said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Kievit said he simply cannot foresee an end to rising prices. ''This area has always been strong,'' he said of Monmouth and Ocean Counties, both of which hug the shore. ''There is only one ocean, and only one financial center to commute to in Manhattan. Short of Wall Street moving to Idaho, I think it will always be an attractive place to live.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photo: This renovated three-bedroom home on Parkview Drive in Bloomfield sold in March for $509,000, which was $110,000 over the asking price. One realtor said that prices have risen 15 percent since the beginning of the year on top of a 15 percent increase last year. (Dith Pran/The New York Times)  </p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID LEONHARDT      </div><div>1510 words</div><div>3 June 2003</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2003 New York Times Company      </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION: A chart in Business Day on Tuesday showing the rise in home prices in the first quarter of 2003 for parts of New York, California, Florida and Massachusetts carried an incorrect label from a document provided by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight for increases during a longer period. The gains were for the last five years, not since 1980.     </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, June 2 -- The growth of house prices has slowed sharply over the last year, increasing by the smallest amount in five years during the first three months of 2003, according to a government report released today.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report relieved some of the growing fears that the housing market was a bubble beginning to burst, particularly in California, the Northeast and other places where home values soared over the last decade. During the first quarter, prices fell in only 13 of the 220 metropolitan areas ranked by the government, down from 22 during the fourth quarter of last year and 33 during the third quarter.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one has anything to be concerned about in the immediate future,'' said Shelly Dreiman, a senior economist at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which compiles the data. Over the next few years, ''it depends on what happens with the economy,'' she added.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avoiding a housing slump is crucial to the economic recovery that most forecasters are predicting for the rest of this year, they say. Even the current slowdown in prices could damp economic growth, however, by reducing the amount of money people receive after they sell their homes or refinance their mortgages.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, house prices rose at an annual rate of 3.8 percent during the first three months of 2003, down from 5.4 percent at the end of 2002 and 8 percent at the start of last year, the government said.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest recent price increases have come mostly in places that are on the outskirts of big metropolitan areas and have become havens for people unable to afford homes closer to the city. Between early 2002 and early 2003, the price of a typical home jumped at least 13 percent on Long Island; in Dutchess County and Newburgh, N.Y.; in Santa Barbara, Calif.; in Providence, R.I.; and in Port St. Lucie, Fla., which is north of Miami.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the New York metropolitan area, prices rose at an annual rate of almost 9 percent during the first three months of the year, up slightly from late last year.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 13 areas where prices fell during the first three months of 2003 were a mixture of once-booming technology centers, like Boulder, Colo., and San Jose, Calif., and cities in the country's thinly populated middle, like Kalamazoo, Mich., and Jackson, Miss.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the decreases were small and have been occurring for only a few months. Over the last 12 months, prices rose in all 220 metropolitan areas ranked by the government -- even in the industrial city of Kokomo in northern Indiana, where the increase was less than 1 percent, the smallest for any ranked area.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has become an increasingly important part of the economy over the last decade as the percentage of Americans who own their homes has risen and changes in the banking business have allowed people to refinance their mortgages more easily. The rapid price increases since 2000 have allowed many households to spend money more quickly than their incomes alone would have permitted, lifting growth at a time when businesses have been cutting their spending.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But few economists thought that annual house price increases of 7 percent to 8 percent would continue for very long. Instead, they have wondered whether many local markets had turned into bubbles that would pop like the stock market or whether the price increases would merely slow.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You've got a tug of war going on,'' said Karl Case, a professor of economics at Wellesley College.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not gaining jobs, and the economy is still pretty much in the doldrums,'' he said. ''But there are two things going for the housing market: interest rates are very low, and there's nowhere else to put your money.''      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California, Florida and the Northeast have attracted the most attention as bubble suspects because prices have risen 50 percent to 75 percent in many places there over the last five years. But other than in San Jose, which is in Silicon Valley, prices continued to rise during the first three months of 2003, despite a worsening of the economic slump that is now more than two years old.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In both the Los Angeles and Miami metropolitan areas, prices rose at an annual rate of 7.9 percent. The increase was 6.1 percent in the Washington area, 5.8 in the Boston area and 2.9 percent in the San Francisco area, according to the government data, which compares a house's sale price to its previous sale price.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last year, the biggest increases occurred in the Redding, Calif., and Chico, Calif., areas, both of which are in the north-central part of the state.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study does not include the top end of the housing market because it is based on information collected by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-chartered mortgage agencies that rarely handle loans larger than $322,700. Prices of the most expensive homes have fallen in some areas, real estate agents say.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the declines appear to be isolated. Data compiled by both Fiserv CSW, a research company in Cambridge, Mass., and the National Association of Realtors also show that house prices continued to rise in almost every metropolitan area over the last few months. The two groups analyze homes in all parts of the market.      </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first three months of the year, the median home -- the one worth more than half of all houses and less than half -- cost $161,500, up 7 percent from early 2002, according to the Realtors' group. With a median price of $509,000, the San Francisco area had the most expensive homes, followed by Orange County, Calif., at $448,000, and Boston, at $414,000. The median price in the New York area was $329,000.      </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, May 27 -- Low mortgage rates beckoned buyers in April and propelled sales of new homes to the highest level this year and sales of previously owned homes to the fifth-best month on record, reports released today showed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that sales of new single-family homes rose 1.7 percent from March to April, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.03 million. That was the best showing since December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a second report, sales of previously owned homes rose 5.6 percent in the same period to an annual rate of 5.84 million, the fifth-highest level on record, the National Association of Realtors, a trade group, said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both reports provided fresh evidence that the housing market continues to be one of the few bright spots for the economy. ''Low mortgage rates are keeping the housing market red hot,'' said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third report, from the Conference Board, a private research group, showed that consumer confidence rose in May.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Consumer Confidence Index rose to 83.8 in May from 81 in April, when the index jumped 19.6 points as consumers cheered the swift end of heavy fighting in Iraq. It was the highest level since a reading of 84.9 in November. Analysts had projected an index of 84 for May.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The postwar euphoria experienced last month has quickly given way and consumers' focus has returned to matters on the home front,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the group's Consumer Research Center.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The performance for sales of new homes and existing ones surprised economists. They were predicting new-home sales to drop 2.7 percent and existing-home sales to rise to a rate of 5.70 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, new-home sales jumped 8.2 percent, while existing-home sales fell 5.6 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates drove home sales to record levels last year, and this year is shaping up to be second-best for sales of existing homes and new ones, economists say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in April was 5.81 percent, compared with 6.99 percent for the same month a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates on 30-year mortgages dropped to a new low of 5.34 percent last week, Freddie Mac, the mortgage giant, said. It was the seventh time this year that this benchmark mortgage rate fell to a weekly low.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With interest rates near rock-bottom, it is really a why-not-buy deal,'' said David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, in the Midwest, new-home sales jumped 13.4 percent in April from the month before, to an annual rate of 186,000. In the West, sales rose 4.3 percent, to a rate of 267,000, and in the South they went up 0.6 percent, to a rate of 487,000. In the Northeast, however, sales fell 17.8 percent, to a rate of 88,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For previously owned homes -- the biggest chunk of the housing market -- sales rose 9.6 percent in the West, to an annual rate of 1.60 million in April. In the Northeast, existing-home sales went up 4.8 percent, to a rate of 660,000, and in the South, sales increased 4.1 percent, to a pace of 2.31 million. In the Midwest, sales also rose 4.1 percent, to a rate of 1.27 million.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, March 26 -- Sales of new single-family homes plunged to
the lowest level in nearly three years in February, while manufacturing
demand weakened, according to two reports released by the Commerce
Department today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The reports suggest that February was a very weak month for the
general economy,'' said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America
Capital Management. ''We saw the negative effects of bad weather,
worries about an impending war with Iraq, an increase in oil prices and
a decline in the stock market.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
New-home sales plummeted 8.1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 854,000, the lowest level since August 2000. That came on top of
an even steeper 12.6 percent decline in January.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
There was a 36.8 percent drop in the Northeast, which was hard hit by
snowstorms during the month. That pushed sales in the region down to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 48,000, the lowest since January
1996.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sales in the South fell 8.6 percent, to a rate of 395,000, and in the
Midwest they went down 6.3 percent, to a pace of 149,000. In the West,
sales were flat -- at a rate of 262,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The weather is a problem and so is the weight of uncertainty on
consumer behavior,'' said David Seiders, chief economist at the National
Association of Home Builders. ''I'm assuming both are quite temporary.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the manufacturing report, orders to factories for big-ticket goods
fell 1.2 percent in February, unwinding part of the 1.9 percent gain
reported in January.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Private economists had predicted orders for durable goods -- products
expected to last at least three years -- would fall as companies put off
buying new equipment with war imminent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The weakness in orders to factories was broad based, with losses
reported for computers, cars and metals.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''There does not seem to be enough traction in the economy for the
manufacturing segment to sustain forward momentum,'' said Daniel
Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a
research group.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The manufacturing sector, hardest hit by the 2001 recession, has been
the biggest drag on the economy's ability to return to full throttle.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the durable-goods report, orders for automobiles fell 1.5 percent
in February after a 9.9 percent advance in January.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Excluding orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders
declined 2.1 percent in February, the largest drop in eight months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders for computers plunged 12.3 percent after a 1.2 percent rise in
January. For primary metals, the category including steel, orders fell
2.3 percent after January's 2.8 percent increase.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Shipments, a good barometer of current demand, decreased 1.6 percent
in February after a 2.7 percent gain in January.

Low Interest Rates Help Keep Home Sales Brisk in February

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, March 25 -- Americans, undeterred by impending war and
encouraged by record low mortgage rates, bought existing homes in
February at a brisk pace, the National Association of Realtors reported
today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Homes sold at an annual pace of 5.84 million units, down from a
record 6.1 million in January, the association said. Higher sales levels
occurred only in January 2002, when the pace was 5.96 million and in
December 2002, at 5.91 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The low mortgage rates are expected to buoy sales of houses this year
as well, economists said. Because home sales are counted when the
transactions are completed, the totals reflect purchases arranged in
previous months, before heavy February snowstorms discouraged shopping,
consumer confidence reached decade lows and unemployment edged higher.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Generally strong sales are expected this year, assuming the war in
Iraq is not prolonged,'' said David Lereah, chief economist for the
Realtors' association. At the same time, he said, ''the fragile economy
combined with geopolitical concerns clouds the outlook,'' and last
month's storms will probably reduce March sales.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists had forecast that sales of existing homes would decline to
a 5.8 million annual pace.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The supply of existing homes available for sale, another gauge of
housing demand, fell to 4.4 months' worth in February, from 4.5 months
in January.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The median price of an existing home rose 0.9 percent in February, to
$161,600, from $160,200 the previous month. The price was up 8.2 percent
from a year earlier.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the Midwest, sales rose 4.8 percent, to an annual pace of 1.3
million. In the South, sales decreased 8 percent, to a pace of 2.3
million. Resales in the Northeast dropped 2.9 percent, to 680,000, and
in the West they declined 6 percent, to a 1.56 million annual pace.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 -- Sales of new homes plunged in January at the
fastest pace in nine years, while orders for durable goods posted the
biggest rise in six months, reports from the Commerce Department
indicated today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The sale of new single-family homes fell to a seasonally adjusted
annual pace of 914,000, a 15.1 percent drop from December, when sales
reached a record monthly level.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The performance, much weaker than analysts had expected, represented
the worst single month for new-home sales since January 1994, and,
economists said, raised some new questions about consumers' willingness
to make big financial commitments amid worries about a war in Iraq.
Other economists, minimizing the importance of the decrease, cited the
cold weather and seasonal distortions.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, ''you can't dismiss sales being off by 15 percent,'' said
David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home
Builders. ''I think we are seeing more caution.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home sales fell sharply in all parts of the country, except the
Northeast, where they rose. Sales in the Midwest dropped 42.2 percent in
January, to a pace of 163,000. In the South, sales fell 12.9 percent, to
406,000, and in the West, they dipped 1.4 percent, to a pace of 279,000.
But in the Northeast, sales rose 43.5 percent, to a pace of 66,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said orders to
factories for durable goods, relatively costly items expected to last at
least three years, rose 3.3 percent in January. The increase came after
orders fell 0.4 percent in December and 1.2 percent in November.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It surpassed the 1 percent advance that economists had predicted and
was the strongest performance since July.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The gains were broad based. Orders for transportation products rose
5.1 percent in January, in contrast to December's 3.5 percent decline.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders for automobiles increased 10.7 percent, the largest increase
since April, and a turnaround from a 5.9 percent drop in December.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Excluding orders for transportation products, which can swing widely
from month to month, orders for durable goods rose 2.5 percent in
January.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders for computers rose 1.5 percent, down from a 10.4 percent
advance in December. For communications equipment, orders soared 46.1
percent, more than erasing a 15.8 percent decline in December.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Machinery orders rose 5.3 percent, after dropping 1 percent. Orders
for primary metals, including steel, grew 4.2 percent, after a 2.6
percent rise.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In still another report, the Labor Department said new claims for
unemployment benefits rose by a seasonally adjusted 11,000 last week, to
417,000, a two-month high, suggesting that businesses were inclined to
keep work forces lean.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The four-week moving average, which irons out some weekly
fluctuations, also rose, to 399,750, from 395,750 the previous week.

Construction Spending Increased in December

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 -- Construction spending was brisk in December as
home building hit a record, but manufacturing slowed in January,
according to two reports released today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In one report, the Commerce Department said that a 1.2 percent
increase in spending pushed the value of all construction projects to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $858.3 billion. That came after a 0.9
percent gain in November, the agency said, and was the biggest increase
in 10 months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Analysts had been expecting a gain of 0.3 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home building has been the main source of strength for construction.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In December, spending on all residential projects rose to a record
$434.6 billion on an annualized basis, the agency said, a 2.9 percent
increase from November.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While the residential side has been strong, analysts say, the
commercial side of the construction market has remained weak, reflecting
a reluctance by businesses to make big commitments in capital spending,
including new factories and other buildings.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Spending on commercial projects by private builders fell 1.9 percent
in December from November, the agency said, to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $158.6 billion.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The drop was led by declines in spending for office buildings.
Spending was also reduced for hotels and motels, another segment of the
construction market that is still feeling the lingering effects of the
2001 terrorist attacks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Spending on big government projects in December rose 1 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $210.5 billion, the highest level
since February.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For all of 2002, construction spending rose 0.4 percent, a big
slowdown from the 2.7 percent gain in 2001. Last year's performance was
the worst since 1991.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In another report, manufacturing slowed in January.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing
activity slipped to 53.9, unable to sustain December's momentum when the
index jumped to a revised 55.2.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A level above 50 indicates the manufacturing sector is expanding;
below 50 means it is contracting.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, January's performance was a bit better than analysts expected.
They were forecasting a reading of 53.

To the Editor:
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Councilwoman Jessica Bacal's letter to the editor (Jan. 26) regarding
affordable housing in the town of Lewisboro asserts that crediting the
town with only 8 units toward its 129-unit share of the county's need is
misleading.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In 1990, taking into account all the existing affordable housing in
Westchester, the County Board of Legislators determined the need for an
additional 5,000 units in the decade of the 1990's. Therefore, no
pre-existing housing can be deemed to satisfy any portion of that goal.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. Bacal suggests that the town can meet its obligation by relying
on accessory apartments. Since accessory apartments are usually created
by subdividing an existing house without changing its external
appearance, they would have a lesser effect on the town's ''rural
character'' than new units would.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To be ''affordable'' and count toward the goal, an apartment must be
subject to affordability controls for 20 years, on both the income of
those who live in them and the rents charged by their owners. The
accessory apartments in the town are not only not subject to
affordability controls, but their permits are also subject to
discretionary re-approval by the town every two years.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Since accessory apartments are allowed only if owners continue to
live in the house, it must be assumed that they will be free to choose
the kind of household that will be allowed to share it. The probability
that this will lead to the exclusion of families with children and a
variety of other applicants has motivated the Housing Opportunity
Commission's policy of allowing not more than 25 percent of the
municipality's obligation to be satisfied in this manner.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At five units per acre, the town's entire affordable housing
obligation could be satisfied by new construction on less than 26 of the
town's 18,740 acres! How much of an impact could that have on the town's
''rural character''? On the other hand, the affordable housing shortage
is almost universally recognized to be the county's No. 1 problem.
Therefore, blind devotion to the preservation of the town's ''rural
character'' by limiting development to mansions on large lots and by
ignoring the broad socioeconomic impacts of continued exclusionary
zoning evinces a regrettable myopia, which has been condemned by the
state's highest court. It seems no more than reasonable to expect all
town board members to modify ''the Lewisboro way'' of doing things to
reflect the fact that the town is not ''an island entire of itself.''

Orders for Durable Goods and Sales of New Homes Show Gains
</span>
</div><div>By Reuters</div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods rose modestly in December
while sales of new homes increased sharply, according to two government
reports released yesterday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods like aircraft
and machinery edged up 0.2 percent in December, helped by military
spending. But that was less than the 0.9 percent gain economists had
expected, and excluding the military, orders fell 0.2 percent, pointing
to subdued business investment ahead.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The meager December gain followed a revised drop of 1.3 percent in
the previous month and had many economists talking about weak gross
domestic product growth in the fourth quarter, probably below 1 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, viewed as a
proxy for business capital spending, fell 0.1 percent after a 3.1
percent drop in November, bolstering the view that companies are holding
off their spending.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The report shows to us that capital spending was sluggish in the
fourth quarter and is not providing much momentum going into the first
quarter of this year,'' said Rick Egleton, deputy chief economist at BMO
Financial Group in Toronto.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a bright spot for the technology sector, orders for the broad
category of computer equipment rose 3.2 percent, the largest increase
since July. While orders for computers and related products surged,
communications equipment orders sank.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes
increased by more than a million annualized units for a fifth
consecutive month. They rose 3.5 percent in December, to an annual rate
of 1.082 million units, easily topping forecasts of 1.045 million units,
which was also the revised November rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sales of newly built homes in 2002 totaled 976,000, the highest since
the Commerce Department began keeping the statistics in 1963.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A third report, from a private research group, the Conference Board,
showed its consumer confidence index fell to a nine-year low of 79.0 in
January, from a revised 80.7 in December.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While consumer confidence has fallen for seven of the last eight
months, the drop was more moderate than consensus forecasts of a 78.1
reading and consumers' assessment of their present situation actually
improved a bit.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The drop in January consumer confidence was driven by a drop in
consumers' expectations for the next six months. By contrast, most
consumers reported that their situation had improved in the last month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The present situation index, a measure of consumers' current
attitudes about the economy and their finances, rose to 75.4 in January,
from a revised 69.6 in December. But the expectations index, a gauge of
consumers' six-month outlook, fell to 81.4 from a revised 88.1.
