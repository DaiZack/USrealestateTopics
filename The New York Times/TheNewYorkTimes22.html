<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THEY'RE cautious, they're particular, and they're determined not to be taken advantage of.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're Fairfield County's first-time home buyers, and for the past year or so, they've been patiently combing listings for the bargains they think they deserve in a market glutted with inventory.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In years past, they were just happy to get a house they could afford,'' said Eileen Murphy, an agent in the Darien office of William Pitt Sotheby's. ''Now, they're wanting more.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Melissa Axen and her husband, Rafael, an anesthesiologist who works in Mount Kisco. Transplants from San Francisco, they were paying $3,500 a month in rent for a small apartment just below East Harlem, and another $500 a month for a parking space, after they moved last June. Worried they were throwing their money away, the Axens set out to look for a house, first in Westchester, and then, lured by lower property taxes, in Fairfield County.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We saw houses that had been sitting on the market for a while, but the people didn't seem very willing to come down in price,'' said Dr. Axen, 31. ''We saw where the market was heading, and we didn't want to meet them at their price, either.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With nothing to lose, the Axens tried lowballing. ''We made a couple of offers, and we kind of grossly underbid because we thought the places were grossly overpriced,'' Dr. Axen said, acknowledging, ''We got no counteroffers.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sort of take-it-or-leave-it confidence is prevalent among first-time buyers these days, right up until the moment they find the one house they must have, agents say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite declining sales, the median price of single-family homes countywide has continued to hold its own, at $530,000 for the first quarter of the year, up 0.1 percent from a year earlier, according to the Warren Group, a real estate research organization.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because of what they've heard or read about it being a buyer's market, buyers are a little disappointed with prices,'' said Brad Kimmelman, an agent with Neumann Real Estate in Ridgefield. ''They're expecting to get bigger bargains than they are.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many are holding out for highly favorable deals. L. J. Marlin, a vice president of a travel management company, has been looking since January for a two-bedroom condominium in Stamford priced below $350,000. A lifelong renter in her early 50s, she currently lives in a downtown high-rise apartment with her elderly father, who moved in about seven years ago. He has grown so accustomed to Stamford that Ms. Marlin is intent on finding a condo within the city.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She hasn't yet found one that she likes, but even though her lease is up this month, she has not given up. ''It's really very challenging,'' she said. ''I thought there would be more in my price range.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in cases where first-time buyers do find plenty of properties available in their price ranges, they are demanding more for their money. In towns like Darien, where listings in the $800,000 entry-level range once prompted ''feeding frenzies,'' first-timers are turning up their noses unless those houses have newer baths and kitchens, Ms. Murphy said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This market is their friend in that regard. Fairfield County has such a backlog of inventory that in April and May, only 24 percent of the available single-family houses sold, compared with 70 percent for the corresponding period last year, according to Mark Markelz, a sales vice president in the Southport office of William Raveis International.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frequently well-versed in market conditions, the most wary first-time buyers are likely to analyze the purchase process endlessly, sometimes driving agents to distraction. Lauren Wendell, an agent with William Pitt Sotheby's Wilton office, described one client who spent nine months looking only at two-bedroom condos. ''After we looked at a property, he would go back and feed all the information into a spreadsheet,'' Ms. Wendell said. The client did eventually buy a condo in Stamford.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thaddea Sheridan, an agent in the Stamford office of William Pitt, recalled several first-time buyers who lost houses to competitors because they put in such low bids. ''They don't want to buy something and feel that they could have got it for a little less down the road,'' Ms. Sheridan said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ashleigh Osterhout, 28, says she struggles with ''a guilty feeling'' for having paid full price ($445,000) for a Victorian fixer-upper in Norwalk. She and her husband, Brandon, closed on the deal last month after about four months of house hunting.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the other properties they had looked at appeared overpriced, she said, and the sellers ''were still stuck in the mind-set of a couple of years ago when everybody was selling for a huge profit.'' The Osterhouts had hoped to pay less for the Victorian but wound up having to top another bid.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm thinking maybe I should have waited for a house we could have bargained for,'' said Ms. Osterhout, who works in marketing in South Norwalk. ''But we really wanted this house.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Axens feel a little more confident about the deal they struck for a house on Fox Hill Lake in Ridgefield. The half-acre lot is what sold them on the property: the four-bedroom house sits on a hill that slopes down to about 200 feet of lake frontage. The sale price, $560,000, was $90,000 less than the original list price and gave the Axens enough financial leeway to renovate and expand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For former city dwellers, living on the lake is ''kind of like living on vacation,'' Dr. Axen said. ''I think we got good value for our money.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, he concedes, there is one drawback to the otherwise prime location: no takeout delivery.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photos: FIXER-UPPER -- Brandon and Ashleigh Osterhout install new wiring in the kitchen of their Victorian in Norwalk. They have some qualms about having paid the full price of $445,000, but they wanted to top another bid. (Photographs by Thomas McDonald for The New York Times)   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT happens when the American housing industry enters a downturn? It can last a long time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve Board this week indicated that it did not expect a quick reversal of the industry's woes. ''Most participants agreed,'' said minutes of the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting in early May, that ''the correction of the housing sector was likely to continue to weigh heavily on economic activity through most of this year -- somewhat longer than previously expected.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are few economic trends harder to measure than home prices, given that every home is unique, and a house in one area can cost far more than an identical one in another location. All such measures show the market has weakened, but some do not yet show a broad national decline.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One measure that does is the  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price index, which measures house prices by comparing the price of a house with what it sold for before. Its composite of 10 major geographic areas shows that in March prices were, on average, down 1.9 percent from a year earlier, and 3 percent from the peak reached last June.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the accompanying chart shows, that index also hit a peak in October 1989, and went into a decline that lasted a long time. It was not until January 1998 -- 99 months later -- that the index climbed above the 1989 peak.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That index may be more volatile than national indexes because of its heavy concentration on the two coasts. It includes three broad regions in California -- Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco -- as well as Boston, New York, Miami and Washington in the East. The other areas included are Las Vegas, Denver and Chicago. The areas are very broad, with the New York region stretching from New Haven to Trenton.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The charts show the pattern of home prices and national home sales, both for new single-family homes and for existing homes, after the two peaks. Prices are falling more rapidly this time, just as they rose more rapidly coming into the 2006 peak than they had a generation earlier, in 1989.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trends in home sale numbers are similar, however. In the first couple of months after the peak, sales did not slip as much in 1989, but by the ninth month they were off about as much as they are now, with new-home sales particularly hard hit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing that was very different at the 1989 peak from the one in 2006 was the trend in the number of homes being offered for sale. When prices peaked in 1989, the number of homes for sale was already declining, and it continued to fall for some months, perhaps reflecting decisions by homeowners to hold on and wait for prices to come back.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, however, the number of homes for sale rose as the peak neared, and the latest report shows that more than 4.1 million homes were for sale at the end of April, the largest number ever. That included almost 3.6 million existing homes, also a record high.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If enough of those owners are really determined to sell -- in some cases because they cannot afford to make rising mortgage payments -- that could lead to sales figures being higher than in previous times of housing weakness, and to prices falling further as the selling pressure depresses the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York, a city of renters since immigrants began jamming lodging houses and tenements early in the 19th century, has reached two milestones in homeownership:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One in three households now own their dwellings, according to a new analysis of census results. And the number of homes and apartments occupied by their owners has passed one million for the first time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Propelled by a building boom, co-op and condominium conversions, the lifting of rent regulations and the availability of low-interest and risky subprime mortgages, the rate of homeownership in the city increased more from 2000 to 2005 than during all of the 1990s, according to the analysis, conducted by Queens College demographers for The New York Times.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1990, 28.7 percent of New Yorkers owned their homes, according to the census figures. In 2000, 30.2 percent did, and five years later, according to the analysis of the Census Bureau's 2005 American Community Survey, 33.2 percent were homeowners.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is my understanding that 33 percent is a record high for the city,'' said Vicki Been, director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increases spanned all major racial and ethnic groups in the city, and the steepest jumps occurred in some of the poorest neighborhoods: the South Bronx, Central Harlem, the Lower East Side, Washington Heights and Brownsville, Brooklyn. In each of those, the proportion of property owners had risen by more than 70 percent since 1990. In the South Bronx, for example, the Census Bureau found nearly 3,600 homeowners in 2005, up from 1,600 in 1990. Only one neighborhood, Bushwick, Brooklyn, registered a decline.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sarah Plowden, a church administrator, lives with her grandson in a home she bought in East New York, Brooklyn, in 1992 for $110,000 under the Nehemiah program, which has built low-cost houses on land donated by the city. Today, she said, it is worth about two and a half times what she paid for it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've had a chance, in owning a home, to have some equity for retirement if I decide to sell it,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift toward homeownership heralds broad implications for the city's future.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Homeownership,'' says John H. Mollenkopf, executive director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York Graduate Center, ''is the strongest predictor of being likely to turn out in local politics and being a bit more conservative and antitax in your general outlook.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1990, the rate of homeownership among black New Yorkers has risen to 28 percent from 21 percent; among Hispanics, to 16 percent from 12 percent; among Asians, to 40 percent from 31 percent; and among non-Hispanic whites, to 44 percent from 38 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of foreign-born owners is up, too. In 2005, 40 percent of New York's homeowners were born outside the United States; in 1990, 30 percent of them were. ''Everybody's buying,'' said Lourdes Cartagena, a broker with  <span class="companylink">Foxtons</span> real estate in the Bronx and Westchester County.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the analysis also found an increase in the price that the homeownership imposes. Rent consumed a higher proportion of household income in 2005 than in 1990, but the increased costs for homeowners climbed even more steeply. In 1990, 15 percent of homeowners were spending 35 percent or more of their income on housing. By 2005, 32 percent of owners were.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly housing costs for owner-occupied homes and apartments with a mortgage consumed about one-third of the median income in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens in 2005 -- a higher percentage than in all but four counties in the country. Manhattan homeowners spent about one-fifth of their median income.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2000, the median rent rose about 10 percent, to $909 from $823 a month. During the same period, median monthly mortgage costs for homeowners increased more than 15 percent, to $2,062 from $1,786. Those figures did not account for the tax advantages of homeownership, namely the income tax deduction for mortgage interest.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Homeownership rates increased even as fewer and fewer New Yorkers were able to afford the city's housing,'' Professor Been said in an interview. ''Less than 5 percent of home sales in 2005 were affordable to New Yorkers earning the median income, $43,434, down from 10.7 percent in 2000, and less than 7 percent were affordable to those making 120 percent of the median income, down from 21.5 percent in 2000.'' (Generally, ''affordable'' is defined as spending no more than 30 percent of income on housing and a purchase price that is roughly two and a half times the buyer's annual income.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the proportion of homeowners also increased, to about 68 percent -- partly a result of the greater availability of mortgage loans with low initial interest rates or extended terms for first-time buyers with spotty credit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some say that New York City homeownership rates may be less driven by subprime lending because co-ops often don't allow much in the way of 'creative' financing and because homeowners are wealthier in the city than elsewhere,'' Professor Been said. ''But the rate of subprime home purchase loans tripled in New York City between 2002 and 2005, and that likely is accounting for some of the increase in homeownership rates.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaun Donovan, the city's housing commissioner, said officials had identified neighborhoods where subprime lending had grown sharply and where initial foreclosure filings, but not necessarily foreclosures, had increased. The Furman Center found that the highest percentage of subprime lending occurred in Brownsville; East New York; Jamaica, Queens; and Williamsbridge in the Bronx, which also were among the neighborhoods that recorded the largest increases in homeownership.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. cited estimates that the number of foreclosure filings in the city could reach 15,000 this year, more than double the total two years ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Homeownership is not right for everyone,'' said Sarah Gerecke, chief executive officer of Neighborhood Housing Services of New York City, which promotes affordable housing and advises prospective owners.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The desire to own a home can strain even those at higher incomes. David Kolker, a 37-year-old financial analyst and semiprofessional guitarist who has his own band, is moving in the fall from an apartment on East 27th Street in Manhattan, where the rent is rising to $6,000 from $3,100, to a condominium in a converted office building downtown on Greenwich Street. He bought the condo for $1.4 million, and he estimates that it will cost him about $6,500 a month, after his income tax deduction.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At $3,100, I can take my girlfriend out to dinner every night,'' Mr. Kolker said. ''At the new place, I'm buried. But my gamble is that my pay will increase, and the equity will, too.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark K. Levitan, who is leaving his job as senior policy analyst for the Community Service Society, an advocacy group, to conduct research for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's Center for Economic Opportunity, said that another incentive to buy has been rent deregulation, including the removal of rent controls on apartments that become vacant.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Along with the supply-side factors -- more co-ops and condos, greater access to credit -- I would add another: the growing scarcity of affordable rental units,'' Mr. Levitan said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On the demand side, I would guess that there are more people who want to settle in the city and want the security and equity that comes with ownership,'' he said. This is assuming, he added, that the prices reflect the value of the property and that owners have invested in neighborhoods that go up in value.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women are responsible for much of the increase in homeownership. In 2005, they accounted for 47 percent of New York homeowners, up from 34 percent in 1990.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beth Olarsch, a 40-year-old consultant for a financial services company, was renting a sublet in Chelsea and recently bought a one-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side. Her monthly costs are similar.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I could move out and continue paying rent elsewhere, and for about same amount of money,'' she said. ''Or I could pay my mortgage and maintenance and own something.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's rate of homeownership remains the lowest of any major American city. The figure is 36 percent in Boston, 40 percent in Los Angeles, 43 percent in Washington, 48 percent in Houston and 57 percent in Philadelphia.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ownership rate in New York State is also the lowest in the country, although in 1990 the number of households that owned their homes surpassed the number of renters for the first time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1890 census, only about 6 percent of New York City residents reported owning a home. In 1900, even after the consolidated city absorbed residential tracts in Brooklyn and Queens, the overall homeownership rate was just 12 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 1950, with new housing being built for returning military veterans, the share of owners topped 19 percent. With the exception of the 1970s, when the city flirted with bankruptcy, the proportion has been inching up ever since.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But much earlier in the city's history, in the 17th century, homeownership was more commonplace.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A high percentage, probably the majority, of families in New Amsterdam owned their homes -- the obvious exception being slaves,'' said Russell Shorto, author of ''The Island at the Center of the World.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Homeownership was necessary in order to be a burgher, and have a voice in city affairs,'' he said.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT'S spring, the traditional time for hope and growth in residential real estate sales. But beyond the borders of New York City, there are indications that a wintry chill besets the market in much of the region.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island and in Connecticut, brokers report the inventory of unsold homes continues to build, while the number of buyers is reduced by new lending restrictions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, the market seems to have slowed from March to April -- just when things would ordinarily be revving up. The number of sales contracts signed in April declined in 20 of 22 counties monitored by the Otteau Valuation Group, which does market analysis for brokers. Even in Hudson County, which encompasses such sought-after riverfront towns as Hoboken and Jersey City, sales volume declined 21 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next month, units at one newly built high-end condominium building in Hoboken will be put up for auction. Forty of 128 units at the complex, Velocity, which will have 24-hour concierge service, are to be offered at base prices set well below the cost of construction, according to Erik Kaiser, chief executive of the REMI Companies, the developer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kaiser described the auction, to be held on June 24, as an ''out of the box'' strategy designed to generate a blast of attention for high-quality units in a market that he characterized as extremely hot. But the Otteau Group's statistics indicate that Hoboken is actually getting colder: There were 25 percent fewer sales in April than in March.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next door in Jersey City, where numerous condominium projects are under way, 16 percent fewer sales contracts were signed last month than the month before, according to the Otteau Group.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey G. Otteau, president of the company that bears his name, analyzes numbers of signed contracts rather than closed sales, as most multiple listing services do, because they present a more timely read on market conditions. The April statistics are the latest available, he said, and are being provided this week to agents who subscribe to his service.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many brokers in New Jersey, as elsewhere in the region, continue to speak of the market as having bottomed out and moving into recovery. In Westchester County, sales are up, asserted P. Gilbert Mercurio, of the County Board of Realtors. There were 4 percent more closed sales in the six-week period April 1 through May 17 compared with the year before, Mr. Mercurio said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Otteau suggested that such reports might possibly lag behind reality. He said that he, too, had predicted market recovery in New Jersey by now -- and that he had been somewhat surprised by the further weakening in April. Given the definitiveness of the statistics, however, and the likely reasons behind them, Mr. Otteau said he thought the same scenario probably held true around the region.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would say there are two things affecting the market negatively right now,'' he summarized: ''tightening lending standards as a result of problems with the subprime market, and fear that the problems will spill over and affect the market as a whole.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island in recent years, many homes in the middle price range -- $400,000 to $700,000 -- sold with 100 percent financing and multiple loans, said Kathy Anastasio of Anastasio Associates in Huntington. Since banks pulled back on subprime lending practices, ''we lost about 30 percent of our buyers in that price range,'' Ms. Anastasio said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even well-qualified buyers appear to have become more reluctant, Mr. Otteau said. ''It's spring, interest rates are very good, we're not in a recession, we're creating jobs -- slowly, but creating them -- and home builders are offering better pricing than they were a year ago. And buyers are still saying, 'I need to think about it.' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Hoboken, Mr. Kaiser expressed his belief that the ''incredible one-shot deals'' being offered in the auction at Velocity would entice buyers. ''We want to move units and get our building sold,'' Mr. Kaiser said, ''and this is our big kickoff.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building's concrete-slab structure -- a first for Hoboken, Mr. Kaiser said -- is designed to produce soundproof apartments but also produced construction delays of almost a year. A number of signed contracts were voided when the condos were not ready in time, Mr. Kaiser said. ''So, this is our fresh start.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ''singing auctioneer'' from Accelerated Marketing will conduct the auction at the Hyatt Regency in Jersey City. The apartments will be open for viewing from June 1 until the day of the auction, and a broker may place a bid on behalf of a client if he or she has registered in advance, said Jon Gollinger, the chief executive of the marketing company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Examples of apartments being offered include a 909-square-foot one-bedroom, one-bath condo with a den, which had a previous asking price of $520,000 but will have a minimum auction price of $330,000. A 1,100-square-foot two-bedroom, two-bath unit previously priced at $620,000 will be offered for a minimum price of $395,000. A three-bedroom, three-bath apartment with 1,549 square feet that had been priced at $865,000 will be offered for a minimum of $545,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gollinger, who conducted numerous auctions in Manhattan during the housing bust of the early 1990s and recently oversaw the one-day sale of $26 million worth of condos at the Folio building in Boston, said auctioning off brand-new units in a building where sales are just beginning was a first for him.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northeast, he added, is starting to see a return of ''closeout'' auctions, in which the remaining units in multifamily complexes are put up for bid because sales have slowed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, American Properties Realty is holding a closeout auction of 38 condos at the Madison in Ewing, N.J., on June 3 at the Westin Hotel in Princeton. The two-bedroom, two-bath condos were previously priced at $275,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a different situation in Hoboken,'' Mr. Gollinger said. ''The buyers are there. We're just going to call them out.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National Association of Realtors says sales of existing homes fell 2.6 percent in April, to six million, which was slowest rate in almost four years; inventories grew to largest supply in 15 years--8.4 months' worth--and median price of existing home fell 0.8 percent to $220,900; sales slipped most in Northeast; Midwest suffered least damage (M)    </p>

</div><div class="author">By JEREMY W. PETERS   </div><div>594 words</div><div>26 May 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By all measures, April was a bad month for anyone with a ''for sale'' sign in the front yard.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes declined last month as the supply of unsold properties on the market ballooned and prices declined compared with those a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said yesterday that sales of existing homes fell 2.6 percent on an annualized basis, to six million, which was the slowest rate in almost four years. At the same time, inventories grew to the largest supply in 15 years -- 8.4 months' worth -- and the median price of an existing home fell 0.8 percent to $220,900.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors association report came one day after a government report on new-home sales showed that prices dropped last month by the largest amount on record. While that report also showed sales posting their biggest monthly increase in 14 years, many economists dismissed the reading as a fluke, noting that new-home sales data can be wildly volatile.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state of the residential real estate market, as shown in recent days by income reports from home builders, sales figures and other industry barometers, remains dim, economists said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market is lousy,'' said David Sloan, senior economist with 4Cast, a market research firm in New York. ''The overall economy is not growing particularly strong. The Fed is keeping interest rates reasonably high because it's worried about inflation. So I don't think much is going to change in the fundamentals of the housing market.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, a closely watched measure of builder confidence slipped to the lowest level in a year and a half. That sentiment has been reflected recently in the profit margins of the nation's largest builders. On Thursday, the luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers said its profit fell 79 percent from the end of January to the end of April.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, D. R. Horton, the nation's largest builder by volume, reported an 85 percent decline in profit for the first three months. And  <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span>, the nation's second-largest builder, said last month that it lost $85.7 million in the first quarter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors association report showed that sales slipped the most last month in the Northeast. The 8.8 percent decline there came as prices fell 0.6 percent compared with a year earlier to $283,600. In the West, sales fell 1.7 percent while the median price was $338,200, which is 2.1 percent lower than a year earlier. Sales in the South slipped 1.2 percent, and the median price was down 0.3 percent to $181,100.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Midwest suffered the least damage. Sales there declined 0.7 percent and prices rose 1.9 percent from a year earlier to $166,600.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with inventories swelling to such a high level, selling a home in the coming months could get even harder. The Realtors association reported 4.2 million existing homes on the market at the end of April. That is on top of the 532,000 new homes that were also unsold at the end of the month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actual backlog, economists said, is probably higher. New-home sales are recorded when the contract is signed, and the data do not take cancellations into account.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Newport, an economist with Global Insight, said the inventory bulge was ''worrisome, since builders are less likely to start new homes as long as inventories are climbing.''   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI, May 25 -- As dozens of condominium towers conceived during Florida's real estate boom near completion, investors who snatched up units in the preconstruction phase in hopes of turning a quick profit are increasingly trying to break contracts, even walking away from fat deposits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Motivated'' sellers are flooding online forums like Craigslist with advertisements for condo units still months or years from being finished. And lawyers have been inundated with calls from people hoping to avoid closing on units they bought during the speculative craze of 2004 and 2005.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I get two or three of these calls a day,'' said James Ryan, a lawyer in Boca Raton who said he had 40 clients looking to get out of condo contracts. One, Mr. Ryan said, abandoned a $340,000 deposit rather than close on a $1.6 million unit that lost its appeal as the market faltered.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers suggest that it will only get worse. In Miami-Dade County alone, 8,000 new condo units will be completed this year and nearly 12,000 more in 2008.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But demand has dropped markedly, and people who thought they could ''flip'' condos -- buying, then selling for a steep profit before construction is done -- are parting with that fantasy. After years of stunning price increases -- 25 percent in the West Palm Beach-Boca Raton area, for example, from March 2005 to March 2006 -- condo prices have started dropping.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominiums in West Palm Beach and Boca Raton sold for a median price of $211,800 in March, down from $224,600 a year earlier, according to the Florida Association of Realtors. And in Fort Lauderdale, the median price in March was $195,500, down from $202,600 the previous year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, many buyers want out -- not an easy prospect unless they are willing to forfeit the 10 percent or 20 percent they put down, from $15,000 for an inexpensive studio unit to hundreds of thousands of dollars for a waterfront penthouse.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I see buyers unleashing all possible means to try to get out of contracts,'' said Gary Saul, a lawyer in Miami for developers, adding that in some projects, 20 percent of buyers want their money back.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Scarfone, a retired engineer who bought two preconstruction units at Hollywood Station, a complex going up in Hollywood, is seeking to cancel his contracts. Each unit is priced at $300,000. The developer promised a city view from both units, Mr. Scarfone said, but now another building in the complex is blocking it -- a change that he said made the contracts unenforceable.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sent a letter demanding his total deposit of $120,000 back, and after getting no reply, picketed the developer's office. Then Mr. Scarfone called a lawyer, Matthew Schlesinger, who has been unable to recoup the deposit so far.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we have to sue,'' Mr. Scarfone said, ''we're planning on suing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Leon, a retired business executive who moved here from Illinois, said he planned to give up $200,000 in deposits on two condo units in Miami, priced at $500,000 each, after finding ''no loopholes'' in his contracts. He said he was not especially bitter, since he had made money flipping other properties at the height of the boom.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm of the frame of mind that you have to be prepared in business or investments to take a loss,'' said Mr. Leon, 72, adding that he never had any intention of living in either of the units. ''There are some people that mentally can never bring themselves around to that, especially in real estate. But there's a time to hold and a time to fold, and in my opinion, this is a time to fold.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo mania of recent years also beset cities like Las Vegas, Phoenix and Washington, but while those markets are also full of resales, analysts say South Florida drew the most investors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Between the Latin American influence and the out-of-state buyers who have a love affair with Miami because of its ambience,'' said Jack McCabe, a consultant in Deerfield Beach who tracks the South Florida housing market, ''they flocked to it and pushed it to the point where about 70 percent of all sales were to investors.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate analysts say South Florida's housing market peaked late in 2005, and would-be flippers stopped buying in 2006. People who bought condos before 2005 might still make money or at least break even if they sell soon, the analysts say, but those who bought at the height of the mania stand to lose a bundle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ann Nortmann, a sales associate with Majestic Properties, said one of her clients, a New Yorker, bought 11 condo units in Miami starting in 2004 and has sold six -- the last at a $40,000 loss. Ms. Nortmann and others said that with the glut of properties for sale, it might be more prudent to lose a deposit than hold onto a condo indefinitely.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many speculative condo buyers were foreigners, especially Latin Americans looking to shelter their wealth from precarious economies in their home countries. Mr. Schlesinger said he was trying to help some Colombian investors get out of contracts in a project on the Miami River, a hot area during the boom, where prices are now languishing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting out of real estate contracts is hard, Mr. Schlesinger said, because under state law, buyers have to prove that developers ''materially'' changed a project in a way that is ''adverse'' to the buyer. Many buyers want soaring property insurance rates to fall into that category. But a new state law says they cannot.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''About half the time I have to tell people, 'Listen, there's nothing I can do,' '' said Mr. Schlesinger, adding that 20 percent of his clients end up forfeiting deposits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregg Covin, a developer building Ten Museum Park, a downtown high-rise overlooking Biscayne Bay, said that none of his buyers had lost down payments, but that 45 out of 200 had resold their units before closing, often at the same price they paid in 2003 and to so-called vulture investors looking to scoop up multiple units at pre-boom prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many other developers, Mr. Covin requires original buyers looking to resell to do so through an in-house program, and keeps a 6 percent commission. Because his is one of the first boom-time buildings to be finished, he said -- closings are taking place this month -- he has had no problem finding replacement buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now, today, there is no shortage of end-users in Miami for finished, nice product,'' Mr. Covin said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the few new buildings that have opened report many units up for resale. In Blue, a downtown high-rise that opened last year, 87 of the 330 units, or 26 percent, are back on the market, according to the Multiple Listing Service. In One Miami, which also opened downtown last year, 155 of the 800 units, or 19 percent, are for sale.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you drive by in the daytime, they are gorgeous,'' Mr. McCabe said. ''But when you drive by at night, there's no furniture on the patios and only one light on out of 10.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This being South Florida, some are figuring out how to profit from the downturn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zilbert, a real estate agent, recently started CondoSuperCenter.com, a clearinghouse for people willing to resell preconstruction units at their original price. He said he expected thousands of listings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I ask if they'd be willing to sell at their 2003 price and walk away with their deposit back,'' Mr. Zilbert said. ''A lot of people are saying, 'Yes, please, yes, please, yes, please.' ''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STAMFORD -- FOUR years after this city, Connecticut's fourth-largest, mandated that developers include below-market-rate units in all new housing developments, the regulations are finally delivering.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers have added at least 45 condominiums to the city's ''affordable housing'' stock in the last year. Those units are among about 200 to be priced below market rates in approved residential projects, some of which have yet to get under way, said Robin Stein, the city's land use bureau chief.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 45 new units, which are at five separate developments, are extraordinary bargains for the buyers. Far from austere, they feature the same granite counters, crown molding and amenities as other units, but at a fraction of the cost for qualifying first-time buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are needle-in-a-haystack type of opportunities,'' said Joan Carty, president and chief executive of the Stamford-based Housing Development Fund, a nonprofit bank that provides counseling and financial assistance to first-time home buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, Stamford adopted zoning regulations that require developers of any project with 10 or more residential units to offer at least 10 percent of the units at lower prices. The initiative was driven in large part by concerns that high housing costs are driving out the city's labor force.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices on the affordable units are to be set within reach of families earning no more than 50 percent of the Stamford area's median income (currently $116,000), although in certain areas of the city some units must be set aside for people earning no more than 25 percent of the median.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers initially feared that mingling affordable and market-rate units throughout a project would have a chilling effect on sales. Some have opted to make a cash contribution to the city for affordable-housing initiatives in lieu of building units on-site, an option allowed under the regulations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept has had no adverse impact on sales at the projects completed so far, the developers say. The first project to include below-market-rate units under the new regulations, Mill River House, was totally presold before opening last year, according to Seth G. Weinstein of Hannah Real Estate Investors, who developed the property with Paxton Kinol and Ray Kinol of Stillwater Investment Management. Situated in the city's west end opposite a grassy park, the 92-unit condominium building has 11 affordable units.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weinstein, a local developer who was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Manhattan and Long Island, said he had no qualms about the regulations. ''I'm a New York City boy,'' he said. ''I'm used to housing that has a diverse variety of people. Growing up in a rich, segregated ghetto is bad for rich people, not just bad for poor people.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His development's second phase, Adams Mill River, is about to open with 60 more units, seven priced below market rates. He is beginning construction of two projects in the east end -- a 146-unit rental apartment complex and a 112-unit condominium development -- that will include a total of 25 affordable units.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applicants for cut-rate units at both Mill River buildings underwent a thorough screening process, conducted through Housing Development Fund, to ensure that they met the income guidelines and were credit-ready for a mortgage.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was little competition for the affordable units at Mill River, Mr. Weinstein said, but when word got out that the deal was for real, inquiries flooded in for the Adams units. Most of the candidates who ultimately qualified were matched with specific units; a lottery was used to select the winner in cases involving more than one qualified applicant.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While two- and three-bedroom market-rate units at Mill River sold for $324,000 to $571,000, the 11 affordable condominiums went for $80,000 to $260,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers of the reduced-price units are limited to a gain of 3 or 4 percent upon resale in order to preserve the units' affordability, Ms. Carty said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nikita Johnson, 27, a single mother who has lived in public housing for six years, was among the buyers who qualified for an affordable unit at Adams Mill River. A junior accountant at a media group in Norwalk, Ms. Johnson took her 10-year-old daughter, Nyla Delgado, to see their new two-bedroom, two-bath condominium for the first time a couple of weeks ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had no idea what to expect really, because all I had was a floor plan,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''But it's everything I could ask for and more. They have all the appliances in there and wall-to-wall carpeting -- it's gorgeous.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Johnson is among more than 3,000 Stamford-area residents who have gone through the Housing Development Fund's home-buyer counseling programs in the last nine years. The agency offers developers a ''deep pool of applicants'' looking for homes, Ms. Carty said, because ''the hardest thing in Fairfield County is matching people up with appropriately priced product.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building below-market-rate units into high-end developments reduces developers' returns, but the city allows them to build a few more units than might otherwise be approved, said Randy Salvatore, owner of RMS Construction.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company opened the Village at Maple Pointe, in the city's Glenbrook section, last year with 63 town house units, 7 of them affordable. It is currently building the Village at River's Edge, with 170 units, of which 18 are being offered at lower rates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's worked well, and I think the reason why is that this is for-sale housing,'' Mr. Salvatore said. ''It's not like just anyone can qualify. We built and closed on 63 units in a year at Maple Pointe. We have 140 contracts at River's Edge.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inclusionary zoning, he said, ''hasn't hurt us at all, and this is in a market that's been declining.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market-rate units at the two developments start in the mid-$400,000 range and go as high as about $650,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers of high-rise housing, which is concentrated in the city's downtown, have so far without exception opted to meet the regulatory requirement by either paying the buyout fee or building the lower-priced units elsewhere, which is another option under the regulation, according to Mr. Stein. The recently approved Trump Parc tower, for example, will yield the city some $3 million for affordable housing, in lieu of 17 on-site units.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the city raised the buyout fees to better reflect real estate values. The cash contribution in lieu of building a two-bedroom affordable unit, for example, is $279,120 at the 25-percent-of-median level, $168,635 at the 50-percent-of-median level, and $127,930 at the 60-percent-of-median level. Because the intent of the regulation is to produce more inclusionary housing, Mr. Stein said, ''we didn't want to have the buyout so low it would encourage everybody to do that.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Salvatore said he was convinced that the inclusionary concept was the better way to go. ''It's just become now a cost of doing business,'' he said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, May 16 -- Factory output picked up in April and groundbreaking on new homes unexpectedly rose, but permits for future home building slid to their lowest level in nearly a decade, signaling that woes continue in the housing sector.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Federal Reserve report on Wednesday showed that output at factories, mines and utilities rose a greater-than-expected 0.7 percent in April. The amount of industrial capacity put to use increased to 81.6 percent, also above Wall Street forecasts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Commerce Department data showed that while housing starts unexpectedly rose 2.5 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.528 million units, the rate of new building permits sank to the slowest pace since June 1997.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data offered a mixed picture of the economy's health, but most economists are still expecting to see tepid growth through the first half of this year as the economy squeezes out of its housing market troubles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Make no mistake about it, residential investment will take another big bite out of Q2 G.D.P.,'' said Ken Mayland, an economist and president of ClearView Economics.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in housing starts was a surprise, as economists had expected starts to slip to an annual pace of 1.49 million units in April, from the 1.518 million rate first reported for March. The government revised the March figure down to 1.491 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But building permits, which signal future construction plans, dropped 8.9 percent in April, to a pace of 1.429 million units, well below expectations for 1.525 million units.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts are down 16 percent from a year ago, and building permits were off 28.1 percent from a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pace of Growth Slows in Japan   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO, Thursday, May 17 (AP) -- Japan's economy expanded for a ninth consecutive quarter, the government said Thursday, but the pace of growth began to slow.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy expanded 0.6 percent in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter, the government said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If maintained for a full year, the economy would grow 2.4 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the increase is the ninth quarter of growth, the pace slowed from a 5.5 percent annualized growth rate in the previous period. That was the fastest growth rate logged by Japan in three years.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the context of the depressed housing market nationwide, Westchester looks good. The number of sales has been rising since the start of the year, not falling. Prices, however, are down slightly over all, although not in every town -- Rye, for instance, has seen a substantial increase in prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, in another indication of mixed signals about the state of the county's market, foreclosures are down from last year, but up significantly from two years ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all in the United States, sales of previously owned homes dropped 8.4 percent in the first three months of the year, according to the National Association of Realtors, a trade group in Chicago. By contrast, the number of closed transactions during the first quarter of 2007 increased in Westchester by nearly 6 percent from a year earlier, according to a report released late last month by the County Board of Realtors in White Plains.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester's sales at the end of March totaled 1,927, compared with the record high level of 1,998 sales in the first quarter of 2005. Sales of condominiums were up by 17.3 percent in the most recent quarter, to 319.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and others who monitor the national scene ascribed the downturn to winter weather and tightened lending standards for people with weak credit. In Westchester, meanwhile, those keeping tabs on the real estate market cited the weather as a positive factor, even while acknowledging the negative impact of foreclosures and saying it had been even worse a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The warm spell in January brought people out into the market who usually are not out at that time,'' said Harding Mason, president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors and an associate broker at Houlihan Lawrence in Katonah.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps an even larger factor, Mr. Mason said, was the continued growth of jobs in Manhattan and huge end-of-year Wall Street bonuses that ''overflowed into Westchester.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With sales activity strong, inventory grew only slightly. The county's inventory of 6,839 units on the market at the end of the first quarter was only 4 percent higher than last year's, according the report issued by the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, a subsidiary of the County Board of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Westchester and Putnam Counties have not had an excess inventory problem for many years,'' wrote the listing service. ''To the contrary, a sales-limiting, price-pumping deficit of inventory has been the rule more often than not.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Boyland, president of the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, said that if the inventory on hand would take less than six months to sell, the market is seen as favoring sellers; if it would take more than six months, the market favors buyers. ''The ideal situation,'' he said, ''is striking a balance.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the strong sales, however, not all the real estate numbers in Westchester are positive. Most notably, the median sales price of a single-family home continued to drop, and foreclosures were far higher than they were two years ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for a single-family house in Westchester was $635,000, down 2.3 percent from a year earlier, with 21 percent of Westchester houses selling for $1 million or more, the same percentage as in 2006. The median sale price of a condominium was $392,000, nearly 9 percent more than last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes categorized as being in foreclosure in Westchester, according to RealtyTrac.com, a national online foreclosure listing service, was 425 for the first quarter of 2007. Its figures range from houses that are two months or more in arrears on mortgage payments to properties that banks have actually moved to take over. The first-quarter total was considerably lower than the figure for the first quarter of 2006, when the number of foreclosure filings in the county reached 501 -- but it was more than double the 192 filings reported for the county in 2005.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of foreclosure, according to RealtyTrac.com, was 0.12 percent, or one in 822 county households, compared with 0.17 percent in the state and 0.38 percent in the nation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Leogrande, an associate broker for  <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> New York, said that all areas of the county were reporting foreclosures.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For a long time, we were seeing foreclosures primarily in run-down areas,'' Mr. Leogrande said. ''Now we're seeing it across the board.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If owners lag on mortgage payments, ''when house prices drop even just a little, they can't head off foreclosure by selling'' if the value of their property is now less than the amount due on the mortgage.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in the past two years may indeed be tied to high-risk and subprime mortgage lending, but not all defaulters are what Mr. Leogrande called ''hard-luck cases.'' One case, he said, was a single-family four-bedroom house in White Plains that is now up for sale by a bank for $370,000. In that case, he said, the borrower rented out the house, intentionally did not pay the mortgage and walked away from the property, leaving it to the banks to foreclose.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other cases, he said, properties are taking far longer to sell than anticipated. He cited a three-bedroom house appraised at $645,000 in White Plains that went on the market at that price a year ago and remains there. It is now listed at $575,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the situation varies depending on the area of the county, Mr. Boyland said. While the median sales price was down 2.3 percent over all for the first quarter from the same quarter a year ago, it was up 21 percent in Rye, to $1.7 million from $1,358,333, and down 11 percent in Cortlandt Manor, to $424,950 from $477,450 a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Downturns in a market are rarely soft and always local,'' said Mr. Boyland, a sales associate for Keller Williams in Katonah. ''Even when there's an overall increase in the median, that comes as little relief to an individual whose house has been on the market for a long time and has had to drop the price.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester's first-quarter performance was varied enough that the Multiple Listing Service report shied away from making a broad conclusion and cautioned that ''one quarter does not constitute a trend.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarter started at a low point for Westchester real estate. After several years of record sales, the median for a single-family home in Westchester had slipped by more than 3 percent as of the end of 2006, to $630,000. Also, the number of sales for all residential properties had dropped 14 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006, and the dollar volume of sales was down by 12 percent, to $987 million, from the year before.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest quarter, the indicators ''did not all point in the same direction and clearly showed a market that was in transition, as both buyers and sellers adjusted their strategies for dealing with the slowdown that took place in 2006,'' the report read. ''It will take another quarter or two for clearer patterns to emerge.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARC deVENOGE grew up in Manhasset, a wealthy enclave on the North Shore of Nassau County, but spent summers sailing and cycling on the North Fork at the East End of Long Island.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. deVenoge, 49, an accountant who lives with his wife and four children in Manhasset, dreams of moving full time to the North Fork.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My wife would like to be in Cutchogue all year, starting right now,'' he said, standing on the veranda of the Manhasset Bay Yacht Club recently, swirling a glass of wine brought in from a North Fork vineyard.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wine was courtesy of Daniel Gale  <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, served along with cheese and crackers, fruit and a sales pitch at an event that the company held for about 30 people from the well-to-do Nassau areas of Manhasset, Port Washington, Garden City and Rockville Centre.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, which has a major presence in Nassau, expanded to the East End this spring by acquiring the Manhasset and Cutchogue offices of Deirdre O'Connell Real Estate and opening a new office on the Main Road in Southold. Carol Tintle, a regional manager at Daniel Gale, said the firm plans to open at least two more offices there in the next year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sees its existing Nassau customers as a ready-made client base for the verdant vineyards, golf courses and farms and the calm waters of Long Island Sound on the North Fork. This area has traditionally drawn North Shore residents in the summer, Ms. Tintle said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers say more Manhattanites are also looking on the North Fork, as are potential fork-switchers from the Hamptons on the South Fork. Other real estate companies are also sensing opportunity.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Town &amp; Country Real Estate has an office in Southold under construction, said Judi Desiderio of the firm's East Hampton village office. The company already has an office on the North Fork, in Mattituck, in addition to three offices on the South Fork.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corcoran, another large brokerage with offices on the East End and in Manhattan, will be opening new offices on the North Fork in the near future, according to Sheri Winter Clarry, a Corcoran broker who covers the North Fork region.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are some on the South Fork, home of the Hamptons, who think Daniel Gale and others may be throwing money into a slowing market. ''There's no reason for them to go out to the North Fork,'' said Lawrence Porter, managing partner of the Westhampton Beach office of Brown Harris Stevens. ''There's no volume of business there.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices in the town of Southold, one of two North Fork towns (Riverhead is the other) for the first quarter of 2007 decreased 7.3 percent from a year earlier, to $510,000, according to Suffolk Research Services Inc., which tracks East End real estate transfers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes sold in the town went down 8.1 percent in the first quarter, to 90. That followed a decline of 27.4 percent in first-quarter sales a year ago. First-quarter sales hit their peak in 2005, when 135 homes sold.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unit sales also declined on the South Fork in the first quarter, but there was a much higher volume of sales and prices were much stronger there. Median prices increased 6.7 percent for the 337 homes in Southampton, to $795,000, and 14 percent in East Hampton, to $970,000, among the 160 homes sold.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stereotype is that most South Fork buyers come from Manhattan, and Mr. Porter estimated that only about 20 percent of buyers come from Long Island. Of those, many are from South Shore communities in Nassau County, including Hewlett and Lawrence, he said, but Great Neck and Manhasset on the North Shore are also represented.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the North Fork, ''prices have definitely not come back'' to the highs of 2005, said Kathleen Travers, a broker in the Greenport office of Brown Harris Stevens. ''But that's why it's an opportune time to buy.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Fork sellers have responded to the change in the market and have kept their prices low, Ms. Travers said. ''There are a lot of great deals out here now,'' she added.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the North Fork's appeal is its calm relative to the South Fork and its ocean breakers, brokers say. ''The demeanor out here has always been more low key,'' Ms. Travers said. ''It's the sailing as opposed to the motor-boating crowd. It's a lot less glitzy than the Hamptons.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Daniel Gale, a Sotheby's affiliate, moving to the South Shore, where Sotheby's has other real estate offices, may not be an option. But more to the point, Ms. Tintle said, ''Daniel Gale is a Long Island company'' and does not have a presence in Manhattan. The North Fork, with its quieter and less hyped-up atmosphere, ''is so much more for the Long Island buyer,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even summer traffic is easier on the North Fork, where there are two main arteries, compared with the South Fork's notoriously slow traffic on a single main road, Montauk Highway. But while the city dweller may really want to get far, far away for that summer home, the Long Island buyer, brokers say, will balk at any long trip in summer traffic.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Nassau County buyers do tend to stay more west,'' said Ms. Clarry of Corcoran. ''The Manhattan buyers are more willing to go further east, all the way to Greenport or Orient Point,'' at the North Fork's easternmost tip.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Nassau buyers will buy in Cutchogue, Mattituck, Jamesport and Aquebogue, Ms. Clarry said, or in the hamlet of Southold. Prices start at $400,000 to $500,000 for a house inland, on up to $2 million and higher for a home on the Peconic Bay.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deirdre O'Connell, who grew up in New Suffolk, a hamlet in the town of Southold, and is now a broker for Daniel Gale after selling her agency to the company, said, ''You can find that little getaway if you want.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might be a house on a creek with a boat dock for around $600,000, she said, or a waterfront condominium at the Maidstone in Jamesport for up to $900,000. In the town of Riverhead, condos are priced at a more little-getawayish-sounding $300,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. deVenoge said East End prices had ''gone out of sight, but at some point you have to get into the market.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife would be happy with a modest house with ''some kind of view; a barn or an open field, it doesn't have to be water,'' he said. The couple will start searching, even though they will stay in Manhasset until their 11-year-old son finishes high school, Mr. deVenoge said. ''You never know what you might find.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing expanded last month at its fastest pace in almost a year, while pending home sales in March fell to their lowest in four years, according to reports released yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 54.7 in April, from 50.9 in May, above the median forecast of 51.0 among analysts polled by Reuters. The reading was the highest since May 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the third month in a row, the index held above 50, an indication of manufacturing growth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains uncertain whether pickup in the factory activity in April will offset a persistent slump in housing and lift economic growth after an anemic first quarter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said its gauge of pending sales of existing homes fell 4.9 percent, to 104.3, in March, its lowest in four years. That compares with an upwardly adjusted reading of 109.7 in February.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median forecast of analysts surveyed by Reuters was for a March reading of 109.0.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales remained soft in part because potential home buyers with subprime or risky credit are having a tougher time obtaining mortgages, as banks and other lenders tighten their lending requirements to curb future losses from bad loans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're starting to see the effects of a decline in subprime lending and tighter lending standards,'' said David Lereah, chief economist with the National Association of Realtors, which is based in Washington.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''prices paid'' component of the institute's index jumped to 73.0, the highest level since August 2006, from March's 65.5. Economists blamed a resurgence in energy prices for the spike.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With gasoline prices rising, consumers have been reluctant to buy other goods.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two reports showed mixed results on chain-store sales last week. Redbook Research and the International Council of Shopping Centers/UBS both said that sales improved last week over the previous week, but year-over-year growth remained weak.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A headline in Business Day on Wednesday about the drop in sales of existing homes in March to 6.12 million units, on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, misstated the historical context of those sales. While the drop of 8.4 percent was indeed the steepest monthly decline since January 1989, when sales fell by 12.6 percent; the sales did not fall to the 1989 level.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Apr 27 2007    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rebound in residential real estate remains elusive.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two months of stronger sales and some tentative suggestions that the housing market was stabilizing, sales last month of previously owned homes took their biggest tumble in nearly two decades.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said yesterday that sales of existing homes, which account for the vast majority of all home sales, fell 8.4 percent in March. That was the steepest monthly decline since January 1989.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of winter weather and newly tightened lending standards for people with weak credit probably sped the drop, economists said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fresh data on home sales came as two other economic reports showed further deterioration in home prices in major metropolitan areas and a growing sense of consumer unease.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, the news deflated stock prices on Wall Street. Investors quickly shook off their worries and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average high enough to come within 11 points of 13,000 -- a high point it has never crossed. But at the close of the trading day stocks finished mixed, with the Dow closing up 34.54 points, to 12,953.94.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors association's report reflected a housing market that became increasingly unfriendly to those looking to sell their homes last month. While the number of unsold existing homes for sale fell 1.6 percent in March, to 3,745,000, it took longer to sell a home. There was a 7.3-month supply of unsold properties last month, up from a 6.8-month supply in February.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The backlog grew even as prices dropped. The median price of an existing single-family home decreased 0.9 percent last month, to $215,300, compared with a year earlier. Total sales compared with a year earlier were off 11.3 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because demand is weak, and because inventories remain high, there's little ability for prices to rise,'' said Celia Chen, director of housing economics at Moody's economy.com. Ms. Chen speculated that the overall inventory number may have declined last month because sellers were pulling their homes off the market in frustration.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The overall trend in housing is still weak,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp fall in existing home sales last month was a sign that the increases earlier this year were not in line with the market's underlying path.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The January, February figures were certainly higher than many analysts had anticipated, and that was due to the sort of artificial elevation from the warm weather,'' said Lawrence Yun, senior economist with the Realtors association. ''Now it's payback time in March.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said that as the weather becomes warmer and seasonal distortions become less of a factor, it will be easier to determine where the market is headed. ''That's when we have the weather influences out of the way, and we'll see the market stabilize, recover or continue to slump,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, housing market conditions were most depressed in the Midwest, where sales fell 10.9 percent in March. Sales in the South declined 6.2 percent, while they fell 8.2 percent in the Northeast and 9.1 percent in the West.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such widespread sales declines suggested that the problems plaguing subprime mortgage lenders -- those who loan to people with weak credit -- are playing a role, said Patrick Newport, an economist with Global Insight. ''The weather really doesn't usually affect existing home sales that much.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said that some would-be buyers with borderline credit are having difficulty obtaining loans. At the same time, mortgage lenders have faced a tight squeeze as more and more subprime borrowers have defaulted on their loans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright spot in the housing data was sales of condominiums. In contrast to overall home prices and sales -- which both declined -- sales of condos and co-op apartments were unchanged last month as prices rose 3.2 percent, to $228,200, compared with a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices on average remained in a slump. The Realtors association report showed the eighth straight monthly price decline. A separate report from Standard and Poor's, which surveyed home prices in 20 major metropolitan areas, found that prices fell in 17 of those cities in February.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only cities where prices rose last month were Dallas, Portland, Ore., and Seattle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Conference Board said yesterday that its measure of consumer confidence for April fell for the second straight month.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems in the subprime loan market will make it more difficult for borrowers to get mortgages and will cause home prices to fall this year for the first time on record, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2007 median price for an existing home probably will decline 0.7 percent, to $220,300, the first drop since the real estate trade group began keeping records in 1968 and probably the first decline since the Great Depression, said Lawrence Yun, an economist with the association, which is based in Chicago. The median price for new homes is projected to increase 0.4 percent, to $246,200 this year, the smallest gain since prices fell in 1991.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home purchases are being derailed as subprime lenders stop financing mortgages or go out of business, increasing inventory and weakening demand, Mr. Yun said. In the last 12 months, at least 40 subprime lenders have halted operations, gone out of business, or sought buyers as borrower defaults increased. On April 2,  <span class="companylink">New Century Financial</span>, the largest independent subprime lender, filed for bankruptcy protection.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subprime loans are made to borrowers with a history of missed payments, untested credit or heavy debt. Lenders to them charge higher interests rates than conventional mortgage companies because borrowers are more likely to default.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been getting reports from Realtors out in the field about home closings not going through at the last minute because of loan problems,'' Mr. Yun said in an interview. ''That impacts all homeowners because it affects prices.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales will probably decline 16 percent this year, to 904,000, while sales of existing homes are likely to fall 2 percent, to 6.34 million, from 6.48 million last year, the association said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates probably will not increase, according to the report. The 2007 average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage will match the 6.4 percent in 2006, and the average for a 30-year annually adjusting mortgage probably will stay at last year's 5.5 percent, the forecast said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A promotional spot for the National Association of Realtors came on the radio the other day. The spot, introduced as something called ''Newsmakers,'' was supposed to sound like a news report, with the association's president offering real estate advice.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the best time to buy,'' Pat Vredevoogd Combs, the president, said cheerfully. ''There's a lot of inventory in the marketplace. Interest rates are low. It's a wonderful tax deduction.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the Realtors' way of thinking, it's always a good time to buy. Homeownership, they argue, is a way to achieve the American dream, save on taxes and earn a solid investment return all at the same time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's how it has worked out for much of the last 15 years. But in a stark reversal, it's now clear that people who chose renting over buying in the last two years made the right move. In much of the country, including large parts of the Northeast, California, Florida and the Southwest, recent home buyers have faced higher monthly costs than renters and have lost money on their investment in the meantime. It's almost as if they have thrown money away, an insult once reserved for renters.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most striking, perhaps, is the fact that prices may not yet have fallen far enough for buying to look better than renting today, except for people who plan to stay in a home for many years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the spring moving season under way, The New York Times has done an analysis of buying vs. renting in every major metropolitan area. The analysis includes data on housing costs and looks at different possibilities for the path of home prices in coming years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It found that even though rents have recently jumped, the costs that come with buying a home -- mortgage payments, property taxes, fees to real estate agents -- remain a lot higher than the costs of renting. So buyers in many places are basically betting that home prices will rise smartly in the near future.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next five years, which is about the average amount of time recent buyers have remained in their homes, prices in the Los Angeles area would have to rise more than 5 percent a year for a typical buyer there to do better than a renter. The same is true in Phoenix, Las Vegas, the New York region, Northern California and South Florida. In the Boston and Washington areas, the break-even point is about 4 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''House prices have to fall more before housing becomes a clear buy again,'' says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com, a research company that helped conduct the analysis. ''These markets aren't as overvalued as they were a year ago or two years ago, but they're still unfriendly. And that's one of the reasons the market is still soft -- people realize it's not a bargain.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is obviously no way to know what home prices will do in the next few years. But there are two big reasons to doubt the real estate boosters who insist that it's once again a great time to buy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first is history. After the last big run-up in house prices, in the 1980s, a long slump followed. In the New York area, prices peaked in early 1989 and then fell 9 percent over the next three years, according to government data. (Adjusted for inflation, the drop was much bigger.) Not until 1998 did prices pass their earlier peak.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep in mind that the 2000-5 boom was even bigger than the '80s boom and that house prices on the coasts, according to the official numbers at least, have fallen only slightly so far. So it is hard to imagine that prices will rise 5 percent a year, or another 28 percent in all, over the next five years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second reason for skepticism is that buying has never been quite as beneficial as Realtors -- and mortgage brokers, home builders and everybody else who makes money off home purchases -- have made it out to be. Buyers have to pay property taxes on top of their mortgage, while renters have the taxes included in their monthly rent bill. Buyers also face thousands of dollars in closing costs (and, in Manhattan, co-op charges). Renters, meanwhile, can invest what they would have spent on closing costs and a down payment in the stock market, which hasn't exactly delivered a bad return over the last 20 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that famous mortgage-interest tax deduction? Yes, it reduces the borrowing costs that come with a mortgage, but it doesn't eliminate them. Renters don't face any such borrowing costs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost two years ago, I interviewed a thoughtful 37-year-old man named Tchaka Owen, who happens to be a real estate agent. (Whatever the sins of the Realtors' association, there are a lot of smart, helpful agents out there. Just remember that they have a financial interest in getting you to buy a house.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Owen and his girlfriend, Polly Thompson, had recently moved from the Washington suburbs to the Miami area and decided to rent a two-bedroom apartment with spectacular bay views. ''You can get so much more for your money, renting instead of buying,'' he said at the time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure enough, house prices soon began to fall in South Florida, and Mr. Owen and Ms. Thompson started to think about buying a place. A three-bedroom Mediterranean-style house that they liked was originally listed for $620,000 last year, but the price was later cut to $543,000. They bought it in June for $516,000. Since then, the market has fallen further, but Mr. Owen said he didn't mind, because they plan to stay in the house at least a decade. ''We love it,'' he told me.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, there are benefits to owning a house beyond the financial, like the comfort of knowing you can stay as long as you want or can fix the roof without permission. But real estate has been sold as more than a good way to spend money. It has been sold as a can't-miss investment. Back in 2005, near the peak of the market, the chief economist of the Realtors' association, David Lereah, published a book called ''Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?'' The can't-miss argument was wrong then, and it may still be wrong today.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After hearing that radio spot, I called Ms. Combs and asked her whether she thought there was any chance that she and her fellow Realtors had gone a bit too far in promoting the boom. ''I absolutely disagree,'' she said, still cheerful. ''We help people look at the marketplace.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I asked what advice she gave her own clients in Grand Rapids, Mich., where she is an agent. ''We often tell people that they need to stay in a house five to six years for it to make sense,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a nuance that didn't make it into her ''Newsmakers'' interview. In Grand Rapids, where the median home costs $130,000, it is probably good advice. In a lot of other places, it may still be too optimistic.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the national housing market is struggling with rising inventory and weakening home values, the prices and number of apartments selling in Manhattan rose in the first three months of this year, according to data released yesterday by several of New York City's largest real estate brokerages. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales volume in Manhattan was up 12 percent over the fourth quarter of last year, according to data provided by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those two brokerages also said that the average price for a Manhattan apartment, including both co-ops and condominiums, rose 6 percent in the first three months of this year over the fourth quarter of 2006. <span class="companylink">The Corcoran Group</span> said prices rose 12 percent, and Prudential Douglas Elliman put the increase at 5.4 percent. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even greater increases were seen in the prices being paid for the largest apartments in Manhattan and for apartments in Brooklyn. The wealthiest New Yorkers paid 20 percent more for apartments with four or more bedrooms than they did in the first quarter a year ago. Buyers also paid an average of 22 percent more than they did a year ago for Brooklyn apartments, especially those in newly constructed or converted buildings. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market got off to a robust start at the beginning of this year when brokers and real estate analysts reported that prospective buyers were crowding open houses and engaging in bidding wars. One appraiser said he expected that enthusiasm to be reflected in higher prices later on. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the second quarter, I think we're going to see more appreciation because of the high level of activity'' early this year, said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brown Harris Stevens reported that the average price of an apartment in Manhattan rose to $1.22 million in the first quarter of this year, up from $1.14 million in the last quarter of 2006, but down from $1.26 million in the first quarter of 2006. <span class="companylink">The Corcoran Group</span> and Prudential Douglas Elliman reported similar trends. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers indicate that New Yorkers are not resorting to the extremes that were common in the market several years ago, when some buyers fought for apartments they had barely seen. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, demand slowed but more recently picked up, data showed. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People were holding back a little bit more a year ago,'' said Hall Wilkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens, though he added, ''Anybody who was holding back, isn't.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While all of the brokerages reported that sales volume increased in the first three months of this year from the fourth quarter of 2006, they reported vastly different numbers. Several companies reported a 10 percent to 12 percent increase, but Prudential Douglas Elliman reported a 42 percent increase. Dottie Herman, the company's president, said that number might partly be the result of the company's increased reporting of co-op sales. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some researchers noted that even though Wall Street experienced one of its most profitable bonus seasons, those buyers did not drive up the market as much as expected because they had so many co-ops and condos from which to choose. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller, the appraiser and author of the Prudential Douglas Elliman quarterly report, pointed out that Manhattan had 5,923 co-ops and condominiums for sale in the first quarter of 2007, compared with the median quarterly average of 5,200 over the last five years. He said that the large number of new condominiums about to be completed were keeping prices from rising too quickly. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Frankly I was expecting to see a little more appreciation than we had seen,'' Mr. Miller said. ''We had to work off more inventory than I had given it credit for.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers said that the Wall Street money seemed to have the biggest effect on apartments with four bedrooms or more. Buyers paid roughly 20 percent more for an apartment with four bedrooms or more than they did in the same quarter last year. That translated into an average price of $7.9 million, according to data provided by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You are paying a substantial premium for that fourth and fifth bedroom,'' said John Burger, a managing director with Brown Harris Stevens and a specialist in these high-priced apartments. ''The people will only step up to that size point if they need that space -- two children at home, a child visiting from college, a child visiting from a past marriage.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers also seemed more willing to pay higher prices for new condominiums in Brooklyn. Corcoran said the average overall prices in Brooklyn rose 22 percent, to $628,000 in the first quarter of this year from $514,000 in the first quarter of 2006. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Percesepe, a <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> regional vice president based in Brooklyn, said that so far there had been takers for the thousands of units that have been completed. ''The more inventory that we've been getting, the more inventory we've been selling,'' he said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, March 26 -- Sales of new homes unexpectedly fell in February, hitting their lowest level in nearly seven years, according to a report released on Monday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales slid 3.9 percent, to an annual rate of 848,000 units, the lowest since June 2000, from a downwardly revised pace of 882,000 in January, the Commerce Department said. Sales for November and December were revised down as well.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the second consecutive monthly decline and the second consecutive month that sales came in lower than Wall Street expected. The consensus forecast had looked for sales to rise to a 985,000-unit pace.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The drop in sales of new homes in February shows a very weak housing market and suggests that home construction will remain a drag on the economy for much of the year,'' said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed, which held benchmark overnight borrowing costs steady at 5.25 percent at its policy meeting last week, also left its future policy options open by dropping an explicit reference to the possibility of pushing rates higher in the future.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report on Monday showed the downtrodden housing market weighing on investors' spirits. The UBS/Gallup Index of Investor Optimism fell to 78 in March, the lowest level since September, from 90 in February.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Beuzelin, a foreign exchange market analyst with  <span class="companylink">Ruesch International</span> in Washington, said the new-home sales data ''further clouds the economic outlook and provides greater traction to the idea that the Fed's next move will be an interest rate cut.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp sales slowdown led to an increase in the number of homes on the market. At the current sales pace, it would take 8.1 months to clear the inventory of unsold homes, up from 7.3 months in January and the highest rate since January 1991.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed the median sales price of a new home rose 2.8 percent in February, to $250,000. But that was still off 0.3 percent from the year-earlier level.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, a real estate trade group reported a stronger-than-expected February for sales of existing homes, which represent 85 percent of the housing market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales pace of previously owned homes rose 3.9 percent last month, to an annual rate of 6.69 million units, the biggest gain since March 2004, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, foreclosures among subprime borrowers, those with weak credit, are likely to increase the inventory of homes and ''dampen our forecast'' for a recovery in the housing sector this year, the chief economist for the industry group said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-home sales report showed sales rose only in the West, where they increased 24.6 percent. In the Northeast, new-home sales fell 26.8 percent; they decreased 20 percent in the Midwest and 7 percent in the South.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank said on Monday that its national activity index, a gauge of the economy, rose to 0.03 in February, from an upwardly revised negative 0.72 in January, bolstered mostly by strength in production indicators.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, March 23 -- Sales of existing homes unexpectedly rose in February by the largest amount in nearly three years, but some analysts expressed concerns that the recovery for the housing industry will be slowed by spreading troubles in subprime mortgage lending.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported Friday that sales of existing homes rose 3.9 percent last month, pushed higher by a sharp increase in sales activity in the Northeast. It was the biggest increase since a similar increase in March 2004.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases increased in three of the four regions of the country -- rising 14.2 percent in the Northeast, 3.9 percent in the Midwest and 1.6 percent in the South. Purchases were unchanged in the West.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of a median home sold last month dropped to $212,800, down 1.3 percent from the same month in 2006. It marked a record seven consecutive months that the median home prime has fallen compared to the same period a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the price declines were helping to lure buyers back into the market. But analysts expressed concerns about what the growing problems in the subprime lending market will do to the sales prospects.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors, said he believed that demand for homes could be cut by 150,000 to 200,000 annually over this year and 2008 because of the lending troubles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our view is that the tightening in the subprime market will have a negative impact on home sales,'' Mr. Lereah said. ''It probably won't postpone the recovery (in housing) but it will slow it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region of the country, sales were up 14.2 percent in the Northeast, a gain that was attributed in part to warmer-than-normal weather this winter, which spurred sales.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes were up 3.9 percent in the Midwest and 1.6 percent in the South, while sales were unchanged in the West. Mr. Lereah said the reluctance of sellers in the West to trim prices was holding back a rebound in that region.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, March 23 -- Sales of existing homes rose in February by the largest amount in nearly three years, but worsening troubles in subprime mortgages were viewed as a roadblock to a full-fledged rebound.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported on Friday that existing-home sales climbed 3.9 percent last month, pushed higher by a milder-than-normal winter that increased sales in some areas like the Northeast.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the biggest one-month gain since March 2004 and left sales at an annual rate of 6.69 million units, a pace that was still 3.6 percent below a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales were up 14.2 percent in the Northeast, a gain attributed in large part to warmer-than-normal weather.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were also up in the Midwest, by 3.9 percent, and showed a 1.6 percent rise in the South. Sales were unchanged in the West, with analysts assigning part of the blame to a reluctance by sellers in that region to cut prices to attract buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the increase in sales, the median price of homes kept falling, dropping to $212,800 in February, down 1.3 percent from a year earlier. That was a record seventh consecutive decline in prices, measured by comparing them to the month a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After five years in which sales set new records, sales of existing homes dropped by 8.5 percent last year, the biggest annual decline in 17 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' report said that the inventory of unsold homes rose in February to 3.75 million units, up 5.9 percent from the January level.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are now concerned that rising defaults in subprime mortgages -- the loans offered to borrowers with weak credit -- will lead to tighter lending standards that will make it harder for new buyers to qualify for loans. As borrowers default on their mortgages, their properties will be added to an already glutted market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors, said demand for homes could be cut by 150,000 to 200,000 annually over this year and 2008 because of the lending troubles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our view is that the tightening in the subprime market will have a negative impact on home sales,'' Mr. Lereah said. ''It probably won't postpone the recovery but it will slow it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the problems in the subprime market, Mr. Lereah said that he believed that the upturn in sales would prove to be sustainable and that the data would show that housing hit bottom in September last year and is now rebounding.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, March 20 -- Construction of new homes rebounded in February after a steep slide in January, but a further decline in building permits was seen as worrisome for the troubled housing industry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building of new homes and apartments rose 9 percent in February, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.525 million units, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday. Construction fell 14.3 percent in January, to the slowest pace in more than nine years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the better-than-expected rebound, activity remained 28.5 percent below the level of a year ago, underscoring housing's steep downturn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications by builders for new permits, a gauge of future activity, continued falling in February, dropping by 2.5 percent, to an annual rate of 1.532 million units. It was the 12th decline in the last 13 months in building permits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Newport, an economist with Global Insight, forecast that housing construction would decline by 19 percent this year, shaving overall economic growth by nearly one percentage point for the entire year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said the organization's survey of builder sentiment tumbled in early March. Many builders expressed concern that tighter loan requirements prompted by rising mortgage delinquencies would hurt sales.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''About 30 percent of the builders responding to the survey said their sales have been adversely affected since the beginning of the year by the tightening of loan standards,'' Mr. Seiders said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, the West led the gains in construction, posting a 26.4 percent jump, which was the best showing since January 1997. Construction activity was also up in the South, increasing by 18 percent, the biggest percentage gain in that region in nearly two years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction fell by 29.7 percent in the Northeast, the biggest one-month plunge in that region since December 1990. Construction fell in the Midwest by 14.4 percent after a 16.4 percent decline in January.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past few years we've been flooded with national housing-market statistics -- chronicling a boom, predicting a bust. But as any homeowner knows, national numbers don't tell you much about what's happening in the local housing market. For that you have to go deeper. ''What's striking if you look closer is that different patterns emerge,'' says Jonathan J. Miller, chief executive of the New York-based real estate appraisal and consulting firm Miller Samuel Inc. ''In New York, for instance, we're finding bidding wars in some markets and prices dropping in others.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to understand where the housing slump has been hitting is to break the market down according to different price tiers. Judging by local data supplied by brokers (national data don't provide a detailed breakdown), it seems that so far it has struck hardest in the middle. In Miami-Dade County for instance, where condominiums represent about two-thirds of the market and single-family homes one-third, the average price of a condo in the $600,000 to $800,000 range (the middle of the middle tier) was down 1 percent in November 2006 compared with November 2005. At the high end, with most properties ranging from $2 million to $4 million, the average price rose 15 percent over the same period. And at the lower end, for condos between $400,000 and $600,000, the average price rose 2 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend is similar in New York. In Manhattan, with its concentration of extremely high-priced properties, the weak middle has been in the range of $2 million to $4 million. Prices of apartments in that range fell an average of 7 percent in November 2006, compared with the previous November. During the same period, the average price of apartments costing more than $10 million rose by 5 percent, and of those under $1 million more than 8 percent. In Chicago, though, the market has been less variable. The average price of a single-family home in the middle -- the $600,000-to-$800,000 range -- fell 1 percent in November 2006, compared with the previous year, while the top (homes above $1 million) also dropped 1 percent. But the bottom end, those properties below $400,000, remained flat.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Weakness in the market has been concentrated in certain segments,'' says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com. ''We're not witnessing the entire housing market in metro areas caving in.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why is the middle taking the blow? Perhaps because those factors that appear to be causing the slump -- overbuilding and concerns about affordability -- have weighed most heavily on that sector. Demand in the middle-price tiers has been supported by historically low interest rates and resulting high affordability, but not by significant gains in income. As rates began their rise and affordability began to decrease, the demand for housing in the middle price range began to fall.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices at the top, by contrast, have been driven by changes in wealth. In recent years wealth creation in the United States has been spectacular for many at the high end. Fueled by a boom in investment income, low taxes and demand from wealthy foreign buyers, the high end of the housing market has continued to experience strong price gains. ''That's the market where we're seeing bidding wars,'' Miller says. In Miami, for instance, developers are still betting on the high end to perform well. Frank McKinney, a developer of oceanfront properties from Palm Beach to Miami, is going ahead with several single-family home developments priced above $20 million. ''If you look at the ultrawealthy class, it's expanding exponentially,'' he says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end markets in cities like Chicago, Denver and San Diego have been less robust, but that's because the wealthy in those markets tend to be doctors, lawyers and small entrepreneurs, and they haven't experienced the outsize gains of the very rich who work in fields like finance.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the low end, the market has held up well nationwide. But there's an important reason for that, too: the availability of credit. The deciding factor for many first-time home purchasers is not home prices or interest rates; it's whether they can get a mortgage at all. And aggressive lending has been a booming business, allowing even people with a weak credit history or limited resources to borrow to buy a house or apartment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be about to change, though. A group of regulators, including the Federal Reserve, is expected to announce tighter lending requirements for the sub-prime housing market in coming weeks. ''Anyone could get a loan up until the end of last year,'' says Zandi, the Moody's economist. ''But that's changing rapidly. And that will take the wind out of the sails of the lower end of the market.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So watch out. Not too long from now we may be looking at another soft spot.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME sellers beware. Despite what real estate industry data might suggest, sales prices were down by 10 to 20 percent around the state last year -- and prices are still flat in most locales, according to an East Brunswick analyst who keeps day-to-day tabs on New Jersey residential transactions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analyst, Jeffrey G. Otteau, who heads the Otteau Appraisal Group and issues the monthly Otteau Report to subscribing brokers, offered this current reading on the overall market: ''It is just beginning to recover.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the state's largest real estate agencies subscribe to the Otteau Report, and hundreds of brokers and agents attend his periodic seminars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although agency executives frequently quote him, Mr. Otteau does not show the same sort of reverence for the National Association of Realtors and its recent rosy numbers about sale prices in New Jersey.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association's year-end report, for example, cited major jumps in home prices in two cities in the state. For the last quarter of 2006, Atlantic City was singled out as the metropolitan area with the largest single-family home-price increase in the whole nation. The median price of $339,800 was 25.9 percent higher than for the fourth quarter of 2005, according to the association.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the Trenton-Ewing area was credited with having the third-highest jump in median home prices nationwide, rising 18.9 percent, to $289,000. (The Salt Lake City area came in second.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sounds like great news for longtime residents of Atlantic City and Trenton ready to sell their homes, but Mr. Otteau begs to differ. ''The problem is, they are not comparing the same housing stock from year to year,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In both Atlantic City and Trenton, communities badly in need of rehabilitation, a number of spiffy new town-house developments were completed last year and hundreds of units were sold. ''That skewed the median price in both those places,'' Mr. Otteau pointed out.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price represents the price at which an equal number of houses were sold for more and for less. Real estate statisticians tend to rely on it rather than the average price because the average can sometimes be skewed by the sale of a relatively small number of houses at either end of the price scale.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Otteau contends that the meaning of the median-price figure is often misperceived. ''It is important to realize,'' he said, ''that median prices do not reflect the same house being sold in two different years, but rather a changing mix of house sales from year to year.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A condominium that may have sold for $450,000 at the Bella in Atlantic City, a 200-unit converted rental tower with asking prices that went up to $720,000, or at Chelsea View, a group of 60 similarly upscale town houses now under construction, represents a new phenomenon, according to Mr. Otteau.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Historically, the city's median prices were in the lower range for New Jersey,'' he said, ''hovering between $250,000 and $300,000 for many years.'' But as developers have ''discovered'' the seaside casino haven over the last few years, more than 1,500 new housing units have been put in the pipeline.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An influx of new housing that replaces deteriorated old housing in a community may skew the median price higher, even if the average sales price for existing homes is barely moving.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large redevelopment projects most commonly occur in urban areas, Mr. Otteau noted, adding that it is more common to find a skewed price in cities than in suburbs. The spread in price range between the oldest most-deteriorated housing and the newest most-upscale housing is generally smaller in suburbs, so the median price is less easily swayed, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With the suburban market,'' Mr. Otteau said, ''let's say there is a neighborhood of 50 houses with an average value of $800,000. In any given year, maybe five of those houses are likely to sell.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That scenario does not produce a big jump in median sales price.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One place in the New York area that has been experiencing a rise in the median price is Hudson County, which includes the cities of Hoboken and Jersey City, where redevelopment has been rife and numerous new condos have come on the market, Mr. Otteau said. The median price for housing rose by 2 percent there in the fourth quarter of 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, however, the sales price for comparable individual condos in Hudson County declined by about 10 percent. ''When you spot-check comparable condos -- I mean, check the same size condos in the same building year to year, as we do -- prices have fallen and not risen,'' Mr. Otteau said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bergen County, a more suburban area, the median price for a condo fell by 13 percent, according to the Otteau Group's statistics. Less new housing construction -- and far less condo construction -- is going on in Bergen than in Hudson.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau said that he is not interested in pillorying the National Association of Realtors, but only in pointing out that the trade association's method of reporting may overstate the strength of the housing market in some locales.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Walter Maloney, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors, said the organization was currently taking flak from other quarters maintaining that its national data on sales prices is skewed low, rather than high, because of a recent uptick in the number of moderately prices homes being sold and a dip in the number of high-end properties being sold.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The truth is always somewhere in the middle,'' Mr. Otteau opined. ''Last year, when there were cries of a real estate market crash, and people were practically jumping out of windows, the N.A.R. talked about a 'gentle adjustment' going on with the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reality was the market definitely did not crash, but it definitely did correct itself, with significant buildup in inventory of homes for sale, and lower sales prices.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Otteau Group's latest figures, for January, to be officially released this week, by the way, indicate the market ''correction'' has ended. Statewide, there were 10 percent more contracts signed in January 2007 than in January 2006 -- and in booming Hudson County, sales volume was up a whopping 40 percent.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After many years of double-digit appreciation in residential real estate around New Jersey, home values did not rise significantly last year and may have slipped, according to real estate market analysts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the New Jersey Association of Realtors says the median home price climbed 2 percent, another industry analyst says it actually fell 10 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether there has been a correction or not, everyone agrees on some things: The years of rapid housing inflation are over, but there has been no crash. And houses are selling now, especially at the more affordable end of the spectrum.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing things under $300,00 or $400,000 starting to move again,'' said Bill Hanley, president of the state Realtors association. ''The days of double-digit appreciation are over, but there are still multiple offers on homes when they are priced right.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey G. Otteau, the president of the Otteau Appraisal Group Inc., an East Brunswick company that studies industry trends for real estate agents, said his analysis, which matches comparable segments of the market over time, indicates that prices have dropped substantially in 2006. He said the Realtors association overstates the actual market prices in the current year because it fails to account for the larger size of newer homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we experienced was not a crash, but an adjustment of about 10 percent, which was needed to bring affordability back into balance,'' Mr. Otteau said. ''The housing market has now begun its recovery.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hanley, manager of Weichert Realtors in Metuchen, and Mr. Otteau each said there were large inventories in more expensive price ranges -- over $600,000 -- that would take a year or more to work off at the present rate of sales. But in lower price ranges, homes have sold more briskly, they said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You'll find you had more appreciation in central and South Jersey, where the more affordable homes are,'' Mr. Hanley said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau predicted that even with sales picking up, the rapid appreciation of prices that was seen in recent years would not resume.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Although the recovery has now begun, prices will remain at or near current levels, and won't increase anytime soon,'' because the unsold inventory will keep supply above demand, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trends in New Jersey are similar to those in the rest of the suburban region. On Long Island, the median home price dropped in Nassau County and rose slightly in Suffolk in January, compared with a year earlier. In Westchester County, the median price dropped 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with the same period a year earlier, and sales volume was down considerably as well.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive officer of the Westchester County Board of Realtors, said he expected prices to remain flat for at least the next two quarters. On Long Island, Pearl Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, a business group, said she expected prices would continue to fall through 2008 before resuming modest appreciation of 2 to 3 percent.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of renewed optimism in Westchester's housing market are being spotted in real estate offices throughout the county these days, even though -- or perhaps because -- median home prices have fallen and are likely to decline even more in the months to come.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In 2006, buyers sat on the sidelines and waited for prices to adjust,'' said Christopher Meyers, the chief operating officer for Houlihan Lawrence, a privately owned agency with 25 offices in Westchester. ''Now it looks like they're moving ahead.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for a single-family home in the county dropped 3.4 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2006 -- the first time since 1994, when the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service began compiling quarterly sales figures, that the median decreased during the fourth quarter compared with the same quarter a year earlier. The median price for a single family home in Westchester as of Dec. 31 was $630,000, down from $652,250 on Dec. 31, 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the number of sales for single-family homes fell almost 15 percent -- to 1,121 -- at the end of last year, and the dollar volume of sales for that category was down 11.5 percent, to $987 million, according to numbers compiled by the listing service.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the declines in such sales figures actually may be good news in disguise, according to Mark Boyland, a leader of a sales team for Keller Williams Realty, an Austin, Tex.-based real estate franchiser with offices in White Plains and Yorktown.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Prices will continue to come down, but that's what we need,'' Mr. Boyland, who is also president of the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, said, suggesting that a readjustment in prices would entice buyers into the market and in turn boost the number of sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing service noted that many sellers, anxious to get top dollar for their homes, have been in denial during the past two years, refusing to recognize that a correction in the market is under way and runaway price increases are a thing of the past.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As sellers finally readjust their sights and buyers respond to the current reality, real estate offices have been reporting an increase in inquiries and more robust turnouts at open houses, with a significant portion of the renewed activity coming from Wall Street types who are receiving substantial bonuses this spring, said Mr. Meyers at Houlihan Lawrence.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we're seeing is a younger group of buyers in their 30s who are experiencing their first rush of liquidity,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate offices are also reporting a pickup in weekend home sales in North Salem, Bedford and Pound Ridge and in Cold Spring in Putnam County and Pawling in Dutchess County, Mr. Meyers said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are some famous people out there looking for horse country with lots of acreage and plenty of quiet, away from the crowds,'' he said. ''As Bedford has grown, buyers are considering properties that are farther north, where there's more land available and less commotion.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After many years of double-digit appreciation in the value of single-family homes on Long Island, the median price for homes dropped 6.25 percent in Nassau County in January and increased only slightly in Suffolk County, compared with the same month last year, according to real estate market analysts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of sales increased, however, creating optimism among real estate agents that this year's spring market would be stronger than last year's. Real estate agents said the market ''bottomed out'' in the last quarter of 2006 and has started to recover.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a home in Nassau was $450,000 in January, a decline of 6.25 percent from a year before, when it was $480,000, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. In Suffolk, the average price of a home was up 1.9 percent, to $397,500 from $390,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across Long Island, the median price was $437,500, down 1 percent from last year, even though sales staged a considerable comeback, increasing 25 percent over January 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a strong market,'' said Donald Scanlon, president of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. ''When people are used to seeing 15 or 20 percent increases, they say we are losing money. But I've seen bidding wars on houses. If it's priced right, it sells. If it's overpriced, it sits.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pearl Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, a business group, agreed. But, she predicted that prices would continue to decline for the next two years before stabilizing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think you will probably see declines through 2008 of 10 to 15 percent,'' Dr. Kamer said. ''Then the market will start to rise again at 2 to 3 percent annually.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said there was too much demand for housing on Long Island for the market to crash. ''This doesn't mean houses aren't moving,'' she said. ''People still need housing, and we are in a full employment economy. The ones that do move are realistically priced. The homeowner who sticks to a price based on prices of a year ago will not see his home move.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere in the region, home prices were stagnant as well. In Westchester, the turnaround has not become apparent yet. The median price dropped 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006, and sales volume was down considerably. P. Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors, said prices had become too high and he expected them to remain flat for the next two quarters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Prices don't have to decrease, but they have to cease increasing to get more in line with regional income,'' Mr. Mercurio said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, the median price of homes increased about 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with a year before, according to Bill Hanley, the president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors. But sales, especially in the cheaper ranges, increased in January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing things under $300,000 or $400,000 starting to move again,'' Mr. Hanley said. ''The days of double-digit appreciation are over, but there are still multiple offers on homes when they are priced right.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the fall of 2005, the greatest boom in home prices in America was going on in Phoenix. People stood in line just to get on lists to buy new homes. It was possible to make lots of money selling a place on a list well before the house was actually built.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak of momentum in that market, according to the Standard &amp; Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index, house prices in Phoenix rose 49 percent in one 12-month period.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was then. When S.&amp; P. released the final 2006 numbers this week, it reported that Phoenix home prices rose just 0.3 percent in 2006. And it said that home prices peaked in June and fell 2.6 percent in the final six months of the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are notoriously difficult to compare. Every house is different from every other, in location if not in construction. The government compiles national averages of new-home prices, but it is hard to determine what they mean, because regional differences are huge.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp; P. indexes, which now cover 20 regions, try to deal with that by recording all sales in an area, and then comparing the price with the price that house fetched the last time it changed hands. They include only single-family homes, not condominiums or cooperative apartments, which can distort the picture in areas where such apartments form a major part of the housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The graphic shows the performance of the indexes, year over year, for 12 areas. They illustrate the wide regional variances, showing that Phoenix was not the only part of the desert that boomed. Las Vegas, with a 53 percent year-over-year rise in the fall of 2004, set the mark for best annual performance. In 2006, prices there rose just 0.9 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big coastal markets also did very well, although not to that extreme, and are now coming down. Prices in the New York region slipped just a bit in 2006, although that figure is distorted because it ignores Manhattan apartment prices, which have been strong. Larger declines were recorded in Boston, Washington, San Francisco and San Diego, but Los Angeles eked out a 2 percent rise for the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These indexes cover two Florida areas, Miami and Tampa, which seem to still be doing well. But it is condominiums that have the most problems down there, with many of them having been bought by speculators who planned to sell quickly, and now find that difficult to do.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst performance for the year came in Detroit, which never really boomed. With the automobile industry continuing to suffer, prices fell 5.9 percent in 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some areas continue to do well. Prices in Seattle rose 12.1 percent last year, the only double-digit rise, although Portland, Ore., came close with a 9.9 percent gain. In 2005, by contrast, half the areas recorded double-digit gains.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are falling, which is bad news for builders, but for those who already own homes the really important issue is price. So far, prices are not very far below peak levels in most markets, but continued weakness could change that, and create pain for those who must sell, or who need to refinance their mortgages.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of new U.S. homes fell 16.6 percent in January and prices were little changed as the number of new homes on the market decreased slightly, according to a government report on Wednesday showing some weakness in the unsteady housing sector.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly decline was the sharpest in 13 years, since a 23.8 percent drop-off in January 1994.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New single-family home sales fell to an annualized rate of 937,000 units from an upwardly revised rate of 1.123 million units in December, the Commerce Department said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting January sales to dip to 1.080 million from the previously reported rate of 1.120 million units in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the median sales price of a new home rose $400 to $239,800 from $239,400 in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, the supply of new homes available for sale rose to 6.8 months' worth from the 5.7 months' worth in December, which represents a 19.3 percent increase. There were a total of 536,000 new homes available for sale at the end of January, down 0.2 percent from December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's data comes a day after a Realtor trade group reported a stronger-than-expected month of existing home sales. The sales pace of previously owned homes rose 3.0 percent in January, the biggest jump in two years, the National Association of Realtors said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales, which represent 85 percent of the housing market, climbed to a 6.46 million-unit annual rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the regions, the West saw the sharpest decline in new home sales with a 37.4 percent drop. In the Northeast, new home sales fell 18.7 percent while they decreased 8.1 percent in the Midwest and 9.7 percent in the South.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN it comes to home sales in Westchester, spring seems to be arriving earlier than usual this year, according to brokers and others who monitor the residential real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a November and December that were more sluggish than usual, phones are jangling again in real estate offices throughout the county and attendance at open houses is swelling, they report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually, the spring selling season doesn't start to warm up until mid-March, and its early arrival this year may indicate that an upswing in the market is finally under way, according to Greg Rand, a managing partner for Prudential Rand in White Plains, and other brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This does not indicate that residential sales prices will be climbing, however; on the contrary, median sales prices may drop even further before stabilizing, Mr. Rand cautioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time in an October-December quarter since 1994, when the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service began reporting statistics on a quarterly basis, the median price for a single-family home in Westchester dropped from the same quarter a year earlier. The median as of Dec. 31 was $630,000, down 3.4 percent from $652,250 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the number of sales for all residential properties in Westchester dropped 13.6 percent, to 2,077, in the fourth quarter of 2006, and the dollar volume of sales was down by 12.7 percent, to $1.315 billion, compared with the fourth quarter of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median will probably be even lower at the end of the first quarter on March 31 -- perhaps by as much as another 3 to 5 percent, Mr. Rand said, based on his tracking of sales so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These sales numbers, which at first glance could be seen as bad news, may actually be signs of a market that is finally growing healthier in Westchester, one of the most expensive counties in the United States, observed Joseph Houlihan, an owner of Houlihan &amp; O'Malley Real Estate Services in Bronxville.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A continued decrease in the median sales price may be a dose of reality in what has been an inflated and one-sided market, he said. ''There was a growing gap between what sellers wanted and buyers were willing to pay,'' Mr. Houlihan said. ''Now, though, it seems sellers are becoming more realistic and that gap may be closing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an example, he cited the case of a three-bedroom, two-bath split level house in Eastchester that went on the market for $669,000 and sold within three weeks because it was priced in line with what comparable houses in the neighborhood were going for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, Mr. Houlihan said, several of his agency's listings that buyers perceived as overpriced have languished on the market, and some sellers have even taken them off the market altogether hoping that prices will soar again soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many professionals believe that a resurgence in sales prices is not likely to happen in the short run. At the offices of the Westchester County Board of Realtors and the Westchester Putnam Multiple Listing Service in downtown White Plains, P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive of the Board of Realtors, said one reason for the recent slowdown was that ''prices had overshot their mark'' in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the increased realism on the part of sellers, Mr. Houlihan said, there were other factors causing an early flurry of activity in the market -- notably, the handsome bonuses being handed out on Wall Street. ''And even if they're not actually buying yet,'' he said of the current crop of house hunters, ''there's definitely a lot more looking going on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linda Roth, the manager of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage's Scarsdale office, cited a seven-bedroom newly built $4.5 million Tudor with lots of high-end extras on Carstensen Road in Scarsdale as ''just the kind of house that Realtors are hoping will draw Wall Street financial types with bonus money in hand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even investment professionals are exhibiting considerable caution, according to Cynthia Landis, a vice president and brokerage manager in Larchmont for <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> International. ''There's definitely bonus money out there,'' she said, ''but people are being very cagey when it comes to talking about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mercurio agreed that the county ''is very dependent on what happens in New York City,'' but he saw other factors in Manhattan that may also have contributed to the increased activity so early in the season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even during the slowdown, about 24 percent of all single-family home sales in 2006 were in the $1-million-plus range,'' he noted. ''Westchester's high-end market has always shown strength.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He speculated that the thriving condo market and lower-than-average unemployment rates in Manhattan were enabling some owners there to sell and begin their search for homes in the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relatively broad selection of properties on the market is also playing a key role in the pickup in activity, said Mr. Rand, whose company has 21 offices, including seven in Westchester.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester's year-end inventory of 5,774 units in all categories was 21 percent higher than at the end of 2005, according to the latest report from the Board of Realtors. The current levels of inventory are comparable to those of the mid-1990's, ''which supported high-performing markets at the time,'' the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest choice of inventory is occurring in the condo market -- ''everything from new luxury units to ordinary duplexes and 20- to 30-year-old construction,'' Mr. Mercurio said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo market has fared better than the markets for single-family homes, co-ops and two to five-family homes, with the number of condo sales in October through December down only 4.2 percent, to 345, from the same quarter in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, sales for single-family homes were down 14.8 percent, to 1,121; co-op sales dropped 14.8 percent, to 437; and multifamily home sales slid 19.1 percent, to 174.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, mortgage interest rates are expected to remain relatively stable, acting as a further lure for buyers, said Joseph Tringali, a banker with the Melville-based Capstar Mortgage Bankers, which has an office in New Rochelle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've seen an upward trend in rates, but historically they're still low,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there is a concern about possible defaults among a group of people who took out adjustable rate mortgages two years ago and who also borrowed 100 percent of the purchase price of their house, Mr. Tringali said. A house that was purchased for $500,000 then, for example, might be worth less now, and the mortgage rates might be due to be adjusted upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, whatever the reason or combination of reasons, the Westchester market seems to ''have finally passed through the low point,'' Mr. Mercurio said, and appears to be moving ahead.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually, the spring selling season doesn't start to warm up until mid-March, and its early arrival this year may indicate that an upswing in the market is finally under way, according to Greg Rand, a managing partner for Prudential Rand in White Plains, and other brokers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This does not indicate that residential sales prices will be climbing, however; on the contrary, median sales prices may drop even further before stabilizing, Mr. Rand cautioned.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time in an October-December quarter since 1994, when the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service began reporting statistics on a quarterly basis, the median price for a single-family home in Westchester dropped from the same quarter a year earlier. The median as of Dec. 31 was $630,000, down 3.4 percent from $652,250 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the number of sales for all residential properties in Westchester dropped 13.6 percent, to 2,077, in the fourth quarter of 2006, and the dollar volume of sales was down by 12.7 percent, to $1.315 billion, compared with the fourth quarter of 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median will probably be even lower at the end of the first quarter on March 31 -- perhaps by as much as another 3 to 5 percent, Mr. Rand said, based on his tracking of sales so far this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These sales numbers, which at first glance could be seen as bad news, may actually be signs of a market that is finally growing healthier in Westchester, one of the most expensive counties in the United States, observed Joseph Houlihan, an owner of Houlihan &amp; O'Malley Real Estate Services in Bronxville.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A continued decrease in the median sales price may be a dose of reality in what has been an inflated and one-sided market, he said. ''There was a growing gap between what sellers wanted and buyers were willing to pay,'' Mr. Houlihan said. ''Now, though, it seems sellers are becoming more realistic and that gap may be closing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an example, he cited the case of a three-bedroom, two-bath split level house in Eastchester that went on the market for $669,000 and sold within three weeks because it was priced in line with what comparable houses in the neighborhood were going for.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, Mr. Houlihan said, several of his agency's listings that buyers perceived as overpriced have languished on the market, and some sellers have even taken them off the market altogether hoping that prices will soar again soon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many professionals believe that a resurgence in sales prices is not likely to happen in the short run. At the offices of the Westchester County Board of Realtors and the Westchester Putnam Multiple Listing Service in downtown White Plains, P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive of the Board of Realtors, said one reason for the recent slowdown was that ''prices had overshot their mark'' in recent years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the increased realism on the part of sellers, Mr. Houlihan said, there were other factors causing an early flurry of activity in the market -- notably, the handsome bonuses being handed out on Wall Street. ''And even if they're not actually buying yet,'' he said of the current crop of house hunters, ''there's definitely a lot more looking going on.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linda Roth, the manager of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage's Scarsdale office, cited a seven-bedroom newly built $4.5 million Tudor with lots of high-end extras on Carstensen Road in Scarsdale as ''just the kind of house that Realtors are hoping will draw Wall Street financial types with bonus money in hand.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even investment professionals are exhibiting considerable caution, according to Cynthia Landis, a vice president and brokerage manager in Larchmont for Sotheby's International. ''There's definitely bonus money out there,'' she said, ''but people are being very cagey when it comes to talking about it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mercurio agreed that the county ''is very dependent on what happens in New York City,'' but he saw other factors in Manhattan that may also have contributed to the increased activity so early in the season.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even during the slowdown, about 24 percent of all single-family home sales in 2006 were in the $1-million-plus range,'' he noted. ''Westchester's high-end market has always shown strength.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He speculated that the thriving condo market and lower-than-average unemployment rates in Manhattan were enabling some owners there to sell and begin their search for homes in the suburbs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relatively broad selection of properties on the market is also playing a key role in the pickup in activity, said Mr. Rand, whose company has 21 offices, including seven in Westchester.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester's year-end inventory of 5,774 units in all categories was 21 percent higher than at the end of 2005, according to the latest report from the Board of Realtors. The current levels of inventory are comparable to those of the mid-1990's, ''which supported high-performing markets at the time,'' the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest choice of inventory is occurring in the condo market -- ''everything from new luxury units to ordinary duplexes and 20- to 30-year-old construction,'' Mr. Mercurio said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo market has fared better than the markets for single-family homes, co-ops and two to five-family homes, with the number of condo sales in October through December down only 4.2 percent, to 345, from the same quarter in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, sales for single-family homes were down 14.8 percent, to 1,121; co-op sales dropped 14.8 percent, to 437; and multifamily home sales slid 19.1 percent, to 174.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, mortgage interest rates are expected to remain relatively stable, acting as a further lure for buyers, said Joseph Tringali, a banker with the Melville-based Capstar Mortgage Bankers, which has an office in New Rochelle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've seen an upward trend in rates, but historically they're still low,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there is a concern about possible defaults among a group of people who took out adjustable rate mortgages two years ago and who also borrowed 100 percent of the purchase price of their house, Mr. Tringali said. A house that was purchased for $500,000 then, for example, might be worth less now, and the mortgage rates might be due to be adjusted upward.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, whatever the reason or combination of reasons, the Westchester market seems to ''have finally passed through the low point,'' Mr. Mercurio said, and appears to be moving ahead.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IS the housing market about to climb out of the cellar or sink further? The stock market was rattled last week, just briefly, by data showing a 10-year low in housing starts. Even so, one economist is beginning to glimpse signs of recovery that he says may be confirmed this week by a pair of reports on home sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Bloomberg News poll of economists forecasts a slight increase in the Tuesday report in sales of existing homes, to an annual rate of 6.24 million units in January from 6.22 million in December. On Wednesday, sales of new homes are expected to record a drop to a rate of 1.08 million units in January, from 1.12 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state of the housing market has been so bleak that Robert MacIntosh, chief economist at the fund manager Eaton Vance, will take a .500 batting average as a sign of a rebound. He considers inconsistency to be an economist's friend in a declining market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those numbers have been all over the lot lately,'' he said, pointing to an improvement in sentiment among builders to an eight-month high, even as housing starts have been plunging.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing market is in bad shape,'' but the wide dispersal of data ''tells you it might be nearing some kind of a bottom,'' Mr. MacIntosh said. ''When you get mixed numbers on the same sector when it has moved dramatically, it tells you it's bottoming out.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Rosenberg, chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, is not so sure. The latest swoon in housing starts brought the decline over the preceding 12 months to 38 percent, close to the level at which the trough in starts typically arrives, he said in a note to Merrill clients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other indicators, like mortgage applications and housing completions, suggest to him that ''there are still more chapters of the story to be written.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With completions running more than 30 percent ahead of housing starts,'' Mr. Rosenberg wrote, ''we believe that the worst of the decline in overall residential construction, employment and housing-related manufacturing output is actually still ahead of us.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He warned that a recovery might be nine months away and that economic growth and employment would be sluggish in the meantime.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. MacIntosh is far more hopeful.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To me the economy is in a neat state of equilibrium,'' he said. ''We're creating just enough new jobs to absorb people coming into the labor force, foreigners are willing to invest here, the current-account and trade deficits are nonevents. It's all good, and a positive story for the financial markets.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DATA WATCH -- The public may not think that it is all quite as good this month as last.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bloomberg poll predicts a dip in consumer confidence, to a reading of 109 from 110.3 in January. The confidence report, from the Conference Board, a private research group, is on the calendar for Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to the nation's factories, it all may be a bit better. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey for February, to be reported on Thursday, is expected to show a reading of 50, indicating perfect balance between growth and contraction, after a reading of 49.3 last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Graph tracks the annual rate for existing home sales from January 2006 to forecasted January 2007.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE are signs that the residential market slowdown is over -- at least for new condominiums, especially if they are near the water. At a number of condo projects, sales are going well enough that buyer incentives like free upgrades or discounted prices are being reduced or eliminated  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We still like to incentive-ize our buyers,'' said Chris Winslow, director of marketing for the northeast at the Tarragon Development Corporation. ''We felt the need to retool, though, because of the strength of the market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Tarragon cut two juicy incentives that it had been offering at its Trio condo complex in Palisades Park: a $10,000 credit toward closing costs and a 4 percent discount off list prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In downtown Hoboken at Tarragon's 1100 Adams building, an incentive of up to $9,000 toward closing costs was reduced to $5,000, and as of March 1, buyers will no longer be eligible for a year's free common charges, Mr. Winslow said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in Edgewater, where Tarragon is building a high-rise tower beside the Hudson River called One Hudson Park, all incentives have been removed. The major come-on had been an offer of two years without monthly common charges, which was worth up to $25,000, depending on the size of the apartment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Edgewater complex will begin opening for occupancy by summer, and sales have been brisk in recent months, Mr. Winslow said. ''We've noticed stronger sales at One Hudson Park, Trio and 1100 Adams since about mid-December,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When sales opened earlier this month at another Edgewater project, Peninsula at City Place, buyers were offered a year's free common charges. But within 10 days, 20 contracts had been signed, and Savanna Partners, the developer, decided it didn't need to stimulate sales at the 201-unit converted rental apartment building, said Sean Osher of CORE Marketing, which is handling sales promotion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are not going to continue doing it because we don't have to,'' Mr. Osher said. ''We've evidently had the good luck of coming to the market at the turn of the upswing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Osher and other market watchers said they could only speculate as to why the residential market is picking up along the Jersey ''Gold Coast.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers and sales agents mentioned the plus-size year-end bonuses handed out to Wall Street financiers as one factor spurring home purchases generally. In addition, the exceedingly tight -- and pricey -- market in Manhattan may be producing a significant ''spillover effect'' along the western banks of the Hudson, they said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, the Jersey waterfront has begun to exert its own appeal to people who might be Manhattan-centered, according to Benjamin D. Jogodnik, a senior vice president at the City Living division of Toll Brothers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Two or three years ago, all that mattered was that you could get a 40 percent price break coming across to the Jersey side,'' Mr. Jogodnik said. ''It was all about the price break, and people thought they were compromising to gain dollars and cents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now, with the Hudson County side coming to fruition, builders really delivering and amenities like a 30 percent increase in park space in Hoboken becoming reality, and new retailers coming, people are seeing how neat it all is -- and they are showing up in droves at our sales centers,'' Mr. Jogodnik said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For City Living's latest condo project in Hoboken, the high-end Harborside Lofts now being created in an old warehouse building at the Hudson Tea complex, no incentives are being offered -- and yet, as many as 75 home shoppers show up each weekend day, he said. Sales opened last fall, and the 115-unit building is now about 70 percent sold out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Maxwell Place in Hoboken, which Toll Brothers is building in partnership with the Pinnacle Companies, Mr. Jogodnik said 300 of 376 units in the second tower have been sold preconstruction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and other developers said that distinctive condos at the high end of the scale seem to be the hottest properties right now -- even at locations that are not on the waterfront.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chatham, Sterling Properties is building a group of 56 town homes with prices starting at $1.225 million. Twelve of 18 units in the first phase of development at the project, which is called Rose Valle, were sold over the last few months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Wall, where Franklin Development Group is building Cedar Hollow Estates, a group of 11 condos set in horse country, free upgrades that were worth as much as $100,000 and included an in-home elevator have been eliminated. Interest in the six homes that remain available -- all of which offer up to 5,000 square feet and are priced in the $1 million range -- is sufficient to warrant this, the developers said this month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, signals point to the possible end of the housing decline in New Jersey, said Jeffrey Otteau, who analyzes market data for brokers. December was the first time in 16 months that there was a higher number of homes sold than in the comparable month a year earlier, he recently reported. Sales were up 2 percent, according to Mr. Otteau.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is compiling comparable figures for January and said he expects sales to be up even more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau does not compile separate figures for condo sales. But he said that in Hoboken -- where large numbers of condos have been sold in recent years -- the pace of sales was up 55 percent in December 2006 over December 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Osher, the marketer of the Peninsula at City Place in Edgewater, said, ''I think we're seeing a general rising tide,'' after 250 brokers and potential buyers attended a party 10 days ago at the opening of sales. ''I spoke with brokers from all over the area today, and everyone is saying things are definitely looking up.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A front-page article on Monday about the resurging residential real estate market in parts of New York City misstated the surname of a woman who has not been able to find a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan for less than $750,000. She is Katalin Staveley, not Shavely.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Thu Feb 22 2007   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the new year began, a burst of activity has broken out in Manhattan and several Brooklyn neighborhoods as New Yorkers frenetically hunt for co-ops, condominiums and town houses, sending prices higher despite sluggish sales in many other cities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preliminary indications from real estate firms showed that this increased activity, with open houses jammed and bidding wars taking place, has occurred in all price ranges -- from tiny studios in the East Village to red-brick mansions on the Upper East Side -- in counterpoint to the heavily weighted record sales of luxury properties that led the market in the late summer and fall.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate brokers and statisticians are quick to point out that not every single apartment is flying into contract. During the last quarter of 2006, the major real estate agencies differed on which way prices were headed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, the three largest real estate companies in the city agree: for January, at least, both prices and the number of signed contracts rose in double-digit percentages compared with the same month in 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With higher Wall Street bonuses, a strong regional economy and pent-up demand from New Yorkers who were once worried that the city's real estate market would crash, buyers' attitudes have done an about-face. ''Their psychology has changed,'' said Frederick W. Peters, the president of the Warburg Realty Partnership. ''For almost two years, they've been scared that the market would plummet and they'd end up like fools who paid too much.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate experts say they see no reason for the trend to not continue, with economists predicting stable mortgage rates and a continuing city budget surplus. However, other factors may alter New Yorkers' renewed interest in buying real estate, including an expansion of the Iraq war, a changing employment picture or another terrorist attack.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, there is ''cautious exuberance,'' according to Steven L. James, director of Manhattan sales for Prudential Douglas Elliman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week ago, one open house attracted 100 people to an Upper West Side one-bedroom; a $2.475 million house in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn sold in a day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the board, the prices of Manhattan apartments are rising. Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm, said the number of contracts signed this January was 19.4 percent higher than in January 2006. Prices were up 14.4 percent in the same time period. Inventory, which was mounting last summer, is shrinking fast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, according to Mr. Miller, statistics showed that sales of studio and one-bedroom units, stagnant over the past year, were up 13.7 percent in January. ''It's not like a lot of huge sales at the high end skewed the average up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a report released last week by the National Association of Realtors, prices are falling in many other metropolitan areas around the country. The report covered only the last quarter of 2006, and showed a modest increase of 3.1 percent for the New York area, which includes parts of northern New Jersey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anecdotally, there isn't much talk of falling prices in Manhattan and in the most sought-after neighborhoods in Brooklyn, where young people looking for a break, empty nesters looking for a guest room and foreigners looking for a pied-a-terre say they want to live.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Katalin Shavely, a 30-year-old bedding designer in Manhattan, devotes her weekends to scanning the classifieds and attending open houses, searching for just the right one-bedroom apartment for less than $750,000. She can't find it. ''I made a mistake,'' she said last week. ''I should have started looking before Thanksgiving.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said New Yorkers had been reluctant to buy because of the feeling of an impending crash. ''Last summer, a lot of information was being dumped on the consumer: stories about the glut of condos in Miami, Washington, D.C., and Las Vegas, exacerbated by the constant debate on the blogosphere about housing bubbles, mixed together with a barrage of negative predictions,'' he said in a telephone interview.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although no one can pinpoint the moment when New Yorkers started feverishly buying again, Kirk Henckels, the director of the private brokerage division of Stribling &amp; Associates, said he thought the luxury market picked up after Labor Day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and others said the resurgence was partly fueled by the fall's record-setting (and well-publicized) sales of a few multimillion-dollar apartments and town houses, like the Stanford White limestone palazzo at 25 East 78th Street bought by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for $45 million and the Harkness mansion at 4 East 75th Street sold in October for $53 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came this year's stratospheric Wall Street bonuses, and the market exploded, real estate executives said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The plunger that freed up all the hesitation at all price levels was those bonuses,'' said Diane Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property. ''It cleaned the pipes and gave confidence to even small apartment buyers.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the last month, the Corcoran Group, Halstead and Prudential Douglas Elliman, three of New York City's largest real estate sales firms, say they have recorded double-digit increases in contract prices and in the number of transactions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a real estate market where 18 and 22 percent price increases were recorded in 2004 and 2005, last year's 6 percent increase was depressing, Mr. Miller said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, the president of the Corcoran Group, reported that the company's contracts for this January totaled $1.3 billion, an increase of 53 percent from January 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in many areas of Brooklyn are going up, too. According to Marc Garstein, the president of Warren Lewis Realty in Park Slope, prices in what he called the downtown neighborhoods -- including Brooklyn Heights, Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Prospect Heights and Windsor Terrace -- are now approaching 2004 highs, after being off about 10 percent in the last two years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A town house at 171 Garfield Place in Park Slope, priced at $2,475,000, sold for the asking price one day after it was put on the market. Fifty people had shown up at the open house, Mr. Garstein said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Customers said they had expected a buyer's market in which they could call the shots, but found a race track, instead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jane LaFarge Hamill, a 25-year-old painter who lives in a ''small, kind of stinky'' studio in Chinatown, said she had looked at 60 apartments over three months, trying to take advantage of the lull she had noticed. ''We decided to look while sellers were still worried that the market was crashing,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she started looking last fall, there was still ''wiggle room,'' she said. But now, there is frenzy, said her mother, Leita Hamill, who, with her husband, Bill, is helping her daughter search for and buy a new home. The Hamills had gotten into a bidding war, one of many reported by brokers these days, for a two-bedroom co-op in Gramercy Park. They had started bidding above the asking price, but it wasn't enough.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were people bidding on the apartment sight-unseen,'' Mrs. Hamill said. The victors got the co-op through a sealed bid, she said. ''It was like a pair of shoes that you absolutely had to have,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate executives say they do not know how long the market's heat will be turned up, although they say the regional economy looks strong.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also say that the first two quarters of the year -- the spring market -- are traditionally stronger than the last two. Thus, the average for the whole of 2007 may or may not show the double-digit growth that the first part of the year is showing. ''It'sall about price now,'' Ms. Ramirez said. ''The market is not in a spike mode, when anything, for any price, will sell.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ramirez, who has sold real estate for more than 30 years, said she expected that the current rocketing growth would be followed by a period of slower yet steady increases. ''I don't want to hear, 'Oh my gosh, the market is slowing up again,' '' she said. ''With the number of deals we had last week, it has to calm down. But I feel much more confident than at any time in the last five years when the market had fits and starts and there was always a certain underlying nervousness.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toward the end of 2004, the real estate market in the city was booming. But then, brokers started seeing ''great concern among clients that mortgage rates were about to jump and that house prices would suffer a sharp correction,'' Mr. Miller said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, there has been change of leadership in Congress, Mr. Miller noted. In the region, unemployment has dropped. Mortgage rates didn't soar. ''Two years ago, we were predicting they'd be up to 8 percent now,'' he said. (Rates for a 30-year fixed loan on a New York City co-op hover around 6.25 percent, according to the Manhattan Mortgage Company.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After months of trying to push shoppers over the edge of indecision, brokers now say they spend time warning house hunters not to rush in heedlessly -- advice the would-be buyers don't always listen to.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When my wife and I got into the market in mid-December, people told me there was a glut of one-bedroom apartments and I could take my time,'' said Shelly Cohen, 51, an empty-nester. ''When we actually got into the market, I found it was just the opposite.'' He just found a newly created condominium in a beige brick high-rise at 1438 Third Avenue at 81st Street and quickly signed the contract. He said he felt he had to.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Hamill, the mother of the young artist in Chinatown, offers her own advice to friends.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now I tell everybody: Be ready to write the check the minute you see something you love,'' she said. ''If it's any good, it'll be gone by the next day.'' She paused. ''Or, even by that same day.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders, grappling with a slump in demand, slowed construction on new homes in January to the lowest level in almost a decade.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported Friday that its seasonally adjusted annual rate of new construction fell 14.3 percent from December and 37.8 percent from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of building permits issued last month also dropped, signaling that the months ahead could be equally bleak in the residential construction business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new construction data contradicted the notion among some builders and economists that the housing market has recently shown signs of bottoming out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't blame this one entirely on the weather,'' said Richard F. Moody, chief economist of Mission Residential, a real estate investment firm. ''We continue to maintain the worst is not over for housing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northeast was the only region in the country where building did not decline. Builders there boosted construction by 8.9 percent compared with December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest of the country, however, did not fare so well. The West saw the sharpest drop, with construction declining 28.5 percent from December. In the Midwest, construction fell 15.2 percent; in the South it dropped 11.8 percent.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By JEREMY W. PETERS  </div><div>734 words</div><div>17 February 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The predicted bottoming-out of the housing market appears, for now, to still be just a prediction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said yesterday that construction of new homes in January slowed to the lowest rate in almost a decade. And in a sign that the months ahead could hold further gloom for the residential real estate market, the number of building permits issued last month also declined.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seasonally adjusted annual rate of home starts dropped 38 percent compared with a year earlier, to 1.4 million in January, meaning that builders would start construction on only 1.4 million new homes this year if that rate continued. That compares with a rate of 2.3 million in January 2006. The number of building permits authorized fell to a rate of 1.6 million, from 2.2 million a year earlier -- a 29 percent decline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said that some of the decline could be attributed to the weather -- January was the first month this winter that was cold enough in many regions of the country to disrupt construction. But economists seemed to agree that most of the drop-off in residential construction indicated that builders were pulling back from a market that was oversaturated with unsold homes and short on buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think this is a weather story,'' said David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders. ''I think this is real stuff. The question is, Where is the real bottom for starts and permits?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northeast was the only region where construction did not decline. Builders there increased construction by 9 percent, compared with December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharpest drop was in the West, where construction declined 29 percent. In the Midwest, construction fell 15 percent; in the South, it dropped 12 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp decline in January followed two month-to-month increases in new-home construction. Those numbers, combined with some encouraging mortgage application data and other signs of tentative improvement in housing, led some economists to conclude that the worst of the slump had passed. But the new statistics contradicted that notion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People started getting a little too excited,'' said Richard F. Moody, chief economist of Mission Residential, a real estate investment firm. ''Over the longer term, the outlook for housing is fairly positive. But it's going to take us some time to unwind the excess buildup.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help shrink the growing backlog of unsold homes, builders are increasingly paying closing costs and offering other incentives like free vacations. In January, 52 percent of builders surveyed by the home builders' association said they were paying closing costs. When the housing market was at its peak in 2003, as few as 10 percent of builders said they were doing so.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because new homes account for only about 15 percent of all homes sold in the United States each year, some economists have pointed to signs of improvement in the market for previously owned homes as evidence that the housing downturn is stabilizing. The sales rate for existing homes rose in October and November, and was down less than 1 percent in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress that ''some tentative signs of stabilization have recently appeared in the housing market.'' He also noted the rather limited impact the slump had had on the rest of the economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all that could change. And as Mr. Bernanke noted, the extent of the housing correction ''may prove greater than we anticipate.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey yesterday showing slipping consumer confidence was a reminder of how fickle economic forces can be. The Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment slipped in February to 93.3, from 96.9 in January. A measure of how Americans think the economy will perform in the future also slipped from January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the bright side, the Labor Department said yesterday that its index of wholesale inflation declined in January as energy prices fell. When energy and food prices were excluded, however, the rate of inflation rose.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no sugarcoating the latest news on the United States housing market. The slump in home prices from the end of 2005 to the end of 2006 was the biggest year-over-year drop since the National Association of Realtors started keeping track in 1982. There are no reasons to believe that's the worst of it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices fell in 73 of the nation's 149 major markets in the last quarter of 2006, compared with 45 declining markets in the third quarter, revealing a downturn that is not only deep but wide.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the number of existing-home sales declined in 40 states, with precipitous drops in previously red-hot markets like Arizona, Florida, Nevada, California and Virginia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of that, a glut of unsold homes virtually ensures that prices will fall further before sales pick up. At the end of 2006, the vacancy rate for family homes was the highest it has been since the Commerce Department started keeping records in 1956.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet it came as a shock to many economists yesterday when the government reported that construction of new homes fell in January by 14.3 percent. The consensus forecast had been for a drop of less than 3 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bust will slow job growth this year in construction and related industries and, with it, consumer spending. The severity of these economic side effects will depend on the strength of the overall job market and the stability of interest rates -- both of which are anybody's guess.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Squarely in harm's way, however, are low- and middle-income homeowners, many of whom have mortgages with rates that are due to adjust upward this year and next. With delinquencies already surging, it is inevitable that a combination of higher mortgage payments and weakening home prices will cause many homeowners to default.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders and regulators should prepare to do all they can to help. During the housing bubble, regulators stood by as mortgages were extended to borrowers with poor or no credit and little or no money for a down payment. Now that delinquencies and defaults are rising, lending standards are being tightened dramatically. That will make it harder for many existing homeowners to refinance their loans, thus hastening defaults. Lenders and regulators must use the utmost flexibility in applying the new standards. They got marginal buyers into the homes in the first place. They should now make every effort to keep them there.   </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home Prices Fall in More Than Half of Nation's Biggest Markets  </span>
</div><div class="author">By VIKAS BAJAJ  </div><div>984 words</div><div>16 February 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for single-family homes fell in more than half of the nation's 149 biggest metropolitan areas in the last three months of 2006, according to data released yesterday by a trade group for real estate agents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures from the National Association of Realtors show that the housing market weakened noticeably in many parts of the country at the end of last year and indicate that suggestions by some industry officials that the market has hit bottom could be premature. In the previous quarter, prices fell in one-third of all metropolitan areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest price declines were concentrated primarily in two kinds of cities: the formerly booming markets along the coasts and in the Southwest, and in Midwest and Northeast cities hurting from the loss of manufacturing jobs. The biggest declines, for instance, were in Florida -- Sarasota-Bradenton (down 18 percent), Palm Bay-Melbourne (17 percent) and Cape Coral-Fort Myers (11.7 percent). The declines in prices were especially steep for condominiums.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have two kinds of weakness here: there is the traditional economic-driven weakness in parts of the Midwest, and there is the bubble-bursting weakness,'' said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs. ''That's what is bringing down the national home price appreciation rate.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the 10 cities with the biggest declines was New Orleans, which has struggled with a slow pace of reconstruction since Hurricane Katrina hit the area in August 2005. Median prices -- half the homes sold for more and half for less -- fell 9.3 percent there, to $162,100. Mr. Hatzius said the decline in New Orleans might also reflect a correction, because prices there shot up in the months after the hurricane.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the median price of single-family homes fell 2.7 percent, to $219,300.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantic City and Salt Lake City topped the list of metropolitan regions where prices increased in the fourth quarter. Broadly speaking, prices were strongest in the Northwest and in some parts of the South.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the number of homes sold fell in 40 states and in the District of Columbia. Nevada and Florida each reported declines of more than 30 percent; in Arizona, Virginia and the District of Columbia, sales fell by more than 20 percent. Nationwide, sales fell 10.1 percent in the fourth quarter from the same period in 2005, to an annual pace of 6.24 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased in six states -- Alaska, Mississippi, Kentucky, Texas, Arkansas and Illinois -- and were flat in Utah. The Realtors did not have enough data on sales in Idaho, New Hampshire and Vermont.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to weaker sales and declining prices, the number of homes on the market has been climbing. That suggests, economists say, that prices may have to fall further for sales to pick up and the overall housing market to recover. In the fourth quarter, the vacancy rate for owner-occupied homes was 2.7 percent, up from 2 percent a year before and the highest it has been since the Census Bureau started compiling the data in 1956.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That means we have got a while before this thing fully adjusts,'' said Edward Leamer, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles. Mr. Leamer noted that individual sellers often preferred to wait rather than cut the price to a level that would be agreeable to most buyers. That gap between seller and buyer is reflected in the decline in sales and the buildup in the number of homes sitting vacant.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Realtors group said it expected home sales and prices to rise in the spring. ''Home sales are leveling at historically high levels, and examination of data within the quarter shows home prices stabilizing toward the end,'' David Lereah, the group's chief economist, said in a statement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike some other sources of data, the Realtors group does not adjust home prices to reflect changes in the kinds of homes being sold. So if this year's sales include a larger number of cheaper homes, compared with a year ago, it will appear that home prices are falling even if the actual price of any given home has not declined.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some indexes, including one compiled by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, the federal agency that oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, do take into account the kinds of homes sold. The government index shows that prices were still rising through the third quarter of 2006, albeit at a far slower pace than in 2005.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City, in the throes of the biggest residential building boom in three decades, issued permits for 30,927 new units of privately owned housing in 2006 -- a near-record number, according to figures released yesterday by city officials. The 2006 number falls just short of the 31,599 units for which permits were issued in 2005, according to the new figures, which were collected by the United States Census Bureau. But the combined total for those two years is the highest two-year total since 1965, the first year for which city officials say there are reliable statistics. The 2005 number is topped only by the 33,084 permits issued in 1972, at the height of the Mitchell-Lama subsidized housing program. JANNY SCOTT  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is easy to calculate the worst time to buy a house: usually, it's exactly when you are looking for one.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it's a buyer's market, then interest rates may be so high that you can't afford anything decent. But if interest rates and prices are nice and low, then smarter, quicker buyers are sure to find the best deals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That can be how it seems, anyway, when so much money is on the line. But a chart from the National Association of Realtors shows that some years are actually much easier on the bank account for the average home buyer, based on the convergence of interest rates, median home price and median family income.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In these days of no money down, the chart somewhat quaintly (and prudently) assumes a 20 percent down payment and 25 percent of gross income going toward mortgage principal and interest. Given those assumptions, the early 1980s, when interest rates soared into the double digits, were the worst time to buy a home, while the early '70s were the halcyon days. PHYLLIS KORKKI  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 -- New-home sales increased in December for a second consecutive month, raising hopes that the worst of the housing downturn is coming to an end.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported Friday that sales last month rose 4.8 percent after a 7.4 percent rise in November.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those two increases, however, were not enough to salvage the full year, which had sales of 1.06 million units, down 17.3 percent from 2005. That was the biggest decline since 1990, when sales fell 17.8 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing bust has come after a boom in which sales of both new and existing homes set records for five consecutive years. Helped by the lowest mortgage rates in four decades, the sales surge was bolstered by investors buying in hopes of reselling the properties for quick profits. Analysts attribute the declines in 2006 to a cooling of that speculation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home sold in 2006 rose 1.8 percent, to $245,300, compared with a 9 percent gain in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said he looked for home prices to remain depressed in 2007 as builders try to reduce high levels of unsold homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said his organization's January survey of builder sentiment showed continued use of incentives to clear the backlog, with 60 percent of builders surveyed offering optional items like kitchen upgrades or decks at no charge, compared with 41 percent at the beginning of 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other incentives include paying closing costs, which 52 percent of builders said they did, compared with 31 percent a year earlier, and paying buyers' financing points on loans, something 30 percent said they did.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report on new homes came after a report on Thursday that sales of existing homes fell 8.4 percent last year, to 6.48 million units, the biggest decline since 1989.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in December rose in all parts of the country except the West, which posted a 4.4 percent decline. Sales rose 27.3 percent in the Northeast, 26.6 percent in the Midwest and 0.3 percent in the South.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding another sector of the economy, the Commerce Department said orders to factories for big-ticket manufactured goods rose in December by 3.1 percent, the largest gain in three months, giving hope that manufacturing will not be seriously affected by the slowdown in housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase was led by demand for commercial aircraft and the biggest increase in orders for cars and trucks in more than two years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding transportation, these orders increased 2.3 percent, the best showing in that category since March and better than analysts had expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2006, new orders rose 7 percent, compared with an 8.6 percent increase in 2005.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 -- Sales of existing homes fell last month, closing out a year when demand for homes slumped by the largest amount in 17 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes were down 0.8 percent in December, a bigger decline than had been expected. For the year, sales fell by 8.4 percent, the biggest annual decline since 1989, when sales of existing homes fell by 14.8 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales figure underscored the sharp contraction in the once-highflying housing market, which before last year had set sales records for five straight years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the sharp decline in sales last year, the median price of an existing home sold in 2006 managed to rise 1.1 percent. But that was far below the double-digit gains during the boom years. The median home price rose by 12.4 percent in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said they believed that the low point for housing had been reached, and they were forecasting a slow rebound in 2007. Because of that optimism, analysts say they do not believe the slump in housing will drag the overall economy into a recession.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 0.8 percent drop in sales in December came after two straight months of improving sales, the first back-to-back sales gains since the spring of 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors, said that he believes that sales of existing homes have hit bottom and will start to gradually improve.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that in 2005, 40 percent of the market represented purchases of second homes and investors buying homes looking to resell them for quick profits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said speculators had now left the market and that should leave sales at a more sustainable level.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economics news, the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits shot up last week by the largest amount in 16 months, reversing two weeks of big declines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department reported that 325,000 newly laid-off workers filed claims for jobless benefits last week, an increase of 36,000 from the previous week. That was the biggest one-week rise since a surge of 96,000 claims the week of Sept. 10, 2005, when devastated Gulf Coast businesses laid off workers after Hurricane Katrina.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GARDEN CITY, Jan. 24 -- In 2000, 60 percent of the homes sold on Long Island could be classified as ''affordable'' for families earning up to $100,000 a year, under the old rule of thumb that buyers should spend no more than 2.5 times their income on places to live.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, according to a new report, just 2 percent of the houses sold on Long Island were in that range for families with such earnings, which make up more than 60 percent of Long Island households.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The staggering drop over six years, according to the Long Island Index, an annual study of local economic and social trends, is the result of sluggish income growth and soaring housing costs, among other factors that have made the area increasingly unaffordable and driven many people away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It took our breath away, that the change has been so dramatic in such a short period of time,'' said Ann Golob, director of the study, which is scheduled for official release Friday. The report, titled ''In a Tough Spot,'' puts it bluntly: ''The image of our region as a wealthy suburb is far from reality for a growing number of Long Islanders who are struggling to keep up with high and rising costs.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though home prices have retreated in recent months, they remain at near-record levels, a bonanza for many homeowners, at least on paper. Those already living here are insulated from the entry barrier of high prices first-time buyers would face.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the nation's first post-World War II suburb, Long Island flourished for decades as a middle-income alternative to New York City and is now home to nearly three million people.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factors contributing to the affordability problem include the loss of higher-paying jobs and growth of lower-paying ones. A decade ago, wages here exceeded the national average by 16 percent; that has shrunk to 5 percent, and average pay has stagnated since 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the number of residents using food stamps rose 20 percent from 2000 to 2003, the most recent data available.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now our income advantage is disappearing, pushing some families near the breaking point,'' the report says. In the report's survey of 808 residents, 58 percent complained of difficulty paying their monthly housing bills, while 54 percent said they were thinking of abandoning Long Island for lower-cost areas. Still, 82 percent called Long Island a good or excellent place to live, but only 48 percent said it was on the right track.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I find it hard living on just a pension and Social Security, and I feel bad for the younger people,'' said John Schnitzler, a retired banker in East Meadow, N.Y. Still, Mr. Schnitzler said he enjoyed his three-bedroom home and being ''45 minutes from the city, 10 minutes to the beach, with the malls right here.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, sponsored by the Garden City-based Rauch Foundation, has been produced annually since 2004, with the advice of academic, civic, labor and other groups.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Taken as a whole, Long Island's story has been a success story,'' it says. ''But our continued success is now in doubt. We face significant problems, which yearly grow worse.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a competitive economy, the report warned, Long Island will lose out to other areas unless it expands business and housing and reduces taxes. ''In an era of easy mobility, a region defers change at its peril,'' it said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2.5-times-income formula for home prices is often ignored across the New York metropolitan area, where many residents spend disproportionately for shelter and shortchange other parts of their budget compared with other parts of the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report did not adjust housing prices for changing mortgage rates, which were about two percentage points higher in 2000. But Ms. Golob noted that homeowners who bought then were able to cut carrying costs by refinancing as rates fell.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond home prices and mortgage rates, an additional factor in the cost of housing is property taxes. They are notoriously high on Long Island and have jumped faster than inflation, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many residents are under financial stress because of scant income growth, up 2 percent on average since 2000. Meanwhile, they are squeezed by the rising costs of taxes, heating, electricity and gasoline. Even for families with incomes above $110,000, 43 percent report difficulty in paying housing bills.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island has yet to replace the aerospace and defense industry that once drove the economy, Ms. Golob said. Venture capital investment and federal research grants have fallen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory has generated businesses. Its president, Dr. Bruce W. Stillman, said the island needs more cooperation by government, academia and business. Finding housing for researchers is so difficult that the lab assigns an administrator to help place them, sometimes in houses it bought for that purpose.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People love their hometown of Long Island -- they just can't afford it any more,'' the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, said in response to the report. ''We remodeled the Levitt houses, and now we have to remodel the suburban paradigm.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''Unaffordable Suburbs''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardly any of homes sold on Long Island last year were affordable to families earning up to $100,000 a year, a group that makes up more than 60 percent of Long Island's households. This is based on the standard formula that a home should cost no more than 2.5 times income.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Real estate sales in parts of Bulgaria have topped Europe's hottest properties lists for the last two years, fed by a booming tourism sector and investment-hungry British and Irish buyers. In contrast, neighboring Romania continues to see big gains, but without yet appearing on the foreign buyer's radar.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both countries joined the European Union on Jan. 1, and real estate analysts say the effects include an increase in confidence -- and, eventually more sales -- from foreigners wanting second homes or investment properties.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's more of a psychological factor from the viewpoint of foreigners who thought Bulgaria and Romania were risky countries,'' said Georgi Dutchev, the editor in chief of Properties Xpress, a magazine published in English and Bulgarian here. For them, E.U. membership ''means transparency and certainty for investment, even though it's not that way, or at least not immediately.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The countries have the lowest property prices in the 27-member bloc, even though they have experienced years of sharp price increases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, a 70-square-meter, or about 750-square-foot, apartment in Sofia would have sold last year for about 48,160 euros, or $62,608, according to figures from the country's National Statistical Institute. That is twice as much as the apartment would have sold for in 1993, when it would have been the equivalent of 24,364 euros, or $31,500. (One square meter is about 11 square feet.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in Romania, the real estate company DTZ Echinox estimates that residential properties in middle-class parts of Bucharest sell for an average of 1,000 euros, or $1,292, per square meter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For comparison, average sale prices in London, where real estate prices are the highest in the European market, are the equivalent of 5,758 euros, or $7,444, per square meter, while those in Genoa, Italy, considered a mid-sized market, average 3,500 euros, or $4,524, according to Colliers International, a real estate consulting firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Milan Khatri, chief economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in London, said two key factors -- lending and increasing incomes -- indicate that local buyers will continue to fuel price increases, at least for now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage lending, which began on a large scale in both countries during the last few years, will expand as banks see there is less risk and interest rates decline, he said. Also, rising incomes will add to residents' buying power, while giving investors added security. ''In that sense, the picture is very positive,'' Mr. Khatri said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another major factor in both countries is the growing demand of people who live in shabby communist-era apartments for bigger, more modern and comfortable housing -- and the shortage of supply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't see a massive price rise, I see a flight to quality,'' said Mike Lloyd, chief executive of TriNation, the Romanian development company that is building the 1.1 million-square-meter, or 11.8 million-square-feet, Baneasa project in Bucharest. The 1.2 billion euro, or $1.55 billion, development will create an entire neighborhood, with residential, commercial and office components.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lloyd said that, while he has encountered speculators who want to buy now in the expectation of selling at higher prices later, he thinks the main impact of E.U. membership will be to educate Romanian buyers about European property standards. ''The junk being built now will struggle to find prices,'' he said. Romanians ''won't accept the low quality that they have in the past.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Orlin Vladikov, chairman of the Bulgarian national property association, said that the country's E.U. membership and the resulting increase in foreign investment will help sustain Bulgaria's property boom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, he said, last September the European Commission confirmed Bulgaria's membership -- and foreign investment in the fourth quarter of 2006 rose 24 percent over the same period in the previous year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vladikov also noted that, while Bulgaria's sales to foreigners initially were along the Black Sea coast and in the Bankso ski zone, new projects are near historical, cultural and natural sites, especially spa areas like Sandanski and Velingrad.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect this development to continue in full force,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others agree. ''I think it's going to bring in another 10 to 15 percent of people who have been hovering a bit,'' said David Smith, sales director of Bulgarian Dreams, a London-based real estate agency.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for future growth, Mr. Smith said, ''I contend that the main reasons will be cheap airfares and cheaper money,'' Two discount airlines -- Wizz Air and Sky Europe -- now serve Bulgaria and Mr. Smith expects more to enter the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some real estate experts are less positive about immediate changes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clara Satchi, chief executive of Engel East Europe, an Israel-based developer, noted that there was great excitement about real estate prospects in eastern Europe just before the E.U. expanded in 2004 -- but then there was a period of stagnation.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Satchi, whose company is building 1,689 residential units in a total of eight projects in Bulgaria, said that while demand is growing, the development of new housing in both countries is about 15 times slower than that in richer E.U. countries.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Jan 19 2007   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- David Franco's illuminated model of a proposed 10-story condominium tower dominates a sales center that, in spite of the ''Now Selling'' banner still fluttering outside, is conspicuously closed for business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We could have waited it out and kept pushing and pushing,'' Mr. Franco said about the decision to abandon plans to sell 180 luxury condominiums with floor-to-ceiling windows offering views of the Washington Monument and Capitol Hill. ''But it would have taken significantly longer.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After six weeks of failing to lure more than a couple of dozen buyers, Mr. Franco and his partner, Jeff Blum, joined the builders of nearly 6,000 condominium units in the Washington metropolitan area who have decided in the last three months to recast their projects as rental apartment buildings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the middle of 2006, the frenzied condominium market here and in several other big cities like Las Vegas, Miami and Boston has collapsed. Once roaring sales have slowed to a trickle, sparse inventory has mushroomed into a glut and soaring prices have flattened out and started falling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cities, banks have significantly scaled back loans to condominium builders. Some have demanded that developers sell half or more of the units in a building before even beginning construction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In hopes of salvaging something from their costly plans, hundreds of developers like Mr. Franco are looking to the strong market for apartments, planning to rent their units for at least a couple of years while waiting for today's condo surplus to shrink. Mr. Franco and Mr. Blum hope to break ground on what will be a somewhat less expensive building this spring.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, developers are even turning older buildings back to rentals after a brief or aborted attempt at condo conversion. Meanwhile, another 2,500 proposed condominiums in the Washington area have been scrapped altogether, according to Delta Associates, a real estate research firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest salvage operation on the part of condo developers is far from a sure bet, however. Condominium buildings generally cost more to build and operate than those built for apartments from scratch. And while rents are high and rising in most cities, in many cases they still are not sufficient to turn a profit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry analysts also point out that rents may start sagging if too many condos are converted into apartments too quickly. While rents were rising at a robust 6.1 percent annual pace in the Washington area late last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, some buildings in the suburbs have recently started promoting move-in specials and other incentives to lure renters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can do it, but it isn't as attractive,'' Tom Meagher, a Boston real estate consultant, said about converting condos into apartments. ''You are not going to get enough rent to cover the cost. You might have to go back and redesign the floor plans.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Boston area, Mr. Meagher is tracking 600 condo projects representing about 49,000 units in various stages, from applying for permits to active construction. While the recent slowdown is forcing developers to consider converting their projects to apartments and offices, he expects as many as a third of them will never be built at all.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Franco said that he and Mr. Blum were able to cut 10 percent from the costs of their planned building, on land in the trendy U Street corridor. That should be enough to make a profit, he said. Beyond switching to some less expensive materials, they also decided to subdivide some larger units into smaller apartments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partners are now going through a similar financial exercise on another proposed building across the street, which was to house 225 condominiums but now could be recast as a rental building as well.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders started tightening the purse strings for the condominium market in early 2006 as sales weakened first in cities like Miami and Las Vegas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Did the lenders pull back soon enough?'' asked Robert Brennan, managing director of real estate finance at Credit Suisse in New York. ''I don't think we know yet.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate experts say condos are more susceptible to booms and busts than single-family homes are because they attract more investors who do not intend to live in them and are easier to build than a new subdivision in many cities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while there are tentative signs that the worst of the overall housing slump may be easing as builders cut back and interest rates remain relatively modest, condo markets continue to suffer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the owner trying to sell a spacious two-bedroom condo for $879,000 in the former Columbia Hospital for Women, which closed in 2002, in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington. In 2004, the investor was so confident that he would make a handsome resale profit that he told his agent, Thomas P. Murphy, he wanted to buy five condos. Mr. Murphy said he flatly told his client he would only assist him in purchasing one unit in any one building.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He needs $890,000 to break even, but the offers are at $800,000 to $840,000,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''He does remember that I told him he was not getting five of them.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could he rent the condo? Yes, but that option is not appealing, either. Mr. Murphy estimates that the unit could rent for $4,000 a month, far short of the $6,800 a month the condo costs in mortgage interest, maintenance fees, insurance and taxes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have a choice of how they want to lose it,'' Mr. Murphy said of investors and condo developers. ''Drip by drip or in one slap.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Murphy said he believed condo sales had picked up somewhat lately and he even ran a four-way bidding contest on one well-priced condo in Foggy Bottom, near the State Department. But the supply of newly built condos is so large and so many of them are similar to each other that many sellers are having to sharply cut their asking price. Others have simply given up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of 2006, 24,200 units were on the market in the Washington area, up from 13,000 at the start of 2005. Sales have slowed to 663 in the fourth quarter of 2006 from 3,520 in the first quarter of 2005, according to Delta Associates. Recorded prices have been flat, which probably masks an effective decline since only the most attractive properties are selling and many owners throw in extra inducements that do not show up in official figures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the few exceptions to the trend is in Manhattan, particularly at the high end. Condo and co-op sales increased to 2,441 in the fourth quarter, from 1,574 a year ago, and inventory was relatively flat at 5,900, said Jonathan J. Miller, an appraiser. Much of the increase can be attributed to a legal change in how sales of co-ops are recorded, but Mr. Miller said a 5.5 percent drop in prices from the third quarter also helped.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, condominium sales have fallen further than those of single-family properties, 13.6 percent from November 2005 to the same month in 2006; free-standing homes showed a 10.7 percent decline in the same period. Inventories have risen 38.1 percent for condos and 29.6 percent for individual homes, according to the National Association of Realtors. The national median price -- half the condos sold for more and half for less -- was $224,600 in November, unchanged from November 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is no comprehensive, national source of data for new condominiums sales. The Realtors group only measures sales of existing units and the Commerce Department, which tracks sales of new single-family homes, does not collect data on condominiums.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the recent housing boom, many cities welcomed condos, hoping the young, upper-income set they attract would help revitalize older neighborhoods. In some cities, condominium construction also gave municipal officials an opportunity to demand that developers set aside some units for affordable housing in exchange for zoning and building approvals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, the area around 14th and U Streets was one of several formerly run-down neighborhoods to get a facelift largely from new condo projects. The area was once a hub of African-American civic and cultural life, but the neighborhood was ravaged by riots in 1968 after Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination and fell into decades of neglect and disrepair.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area has now become home to trendy cafes, a Whole Foods grocery and other stores. But signs of its hardscrabble past linger on in dilapidated apartment buildings and storefronts. The influx of transplants from nearby Dupont Circle and Adams Morgan has also raised the usual strains that accompany gentrification -- rising rents, increased traffic and the displacement of local residents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Franco, who lives in the neighborhood, said he was sensitive to those concerns. His company, Level 2 Development, contributed $1 million to help a group of tenants in low-income apartments buy their building as part of a deal with the local government for the approval of his condo project.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had hoped to take up residence in a 3,200-square-foot corner unit with an expansive terrace, which will now be cut up into smaller rental apartments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as he drove around the neighborhood recently pointing out rows of redeveloped buildings, he acknowledged that the market might have reached its limit for now. As an example, he pointed to a used car lot that seemed to be a vestige of a bygone era.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reality is not everything can make way for condos,'' Mr. Franco said. ''This guy may be doing so much business that it has far more value than what a real estate sale can fetch.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSING bulls took heart on Dec. 27, when the Commerce Department reported that sales of new one-family homes rose 3.4 percent in November from October. While the figure was still well below the rate of November 2005, it represented a recovery from the sharp declines of the summer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sales of new and existing homes showed tentative signs of stabilizing, although at levels well below their mid-2005 peaks,'' the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee said at its December meeting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those who think that the worst may be over for the housing market should take another look at the data, economists say. For the figures on new-home sales have a strange wrinkle that, in the current environment, may lead the government to overstate sales (and to understate inventory) by up to 20 percent. ''The market is weaker than the data say,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's/Economy.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales are tallied by the Census Bureau, based on a sampling of contracts signed by home buyers. Running at a pace of more than one million a year for the last four years, new-home sales have been a significant contributor to the housing boom -- and to the economy. (Existing-home sales, reported monthly by the National Association of Realtors, count actual closings.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here's the rub: If a contract to buy a home, signed in November, is canceled in December, the Census Bureau does not subtract the failed transaction from the number of sales, or add the house back to its inventory total. In the last year, as the housing market has cooled, the volume of cancellations has risen to epidemic proportions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speculators who signed contracts to buy homes in new communities in hot markets like Florida simply walked away from their deposits when they realized they couldn't flip the houses for a quick profit. And as prices and interest rates rose, noted Joseph Carson, chief economist at AllianceBernstein, ''people who committed to making new home purchases found they were having difficulty selling their own houses.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, in the quarter ended on Oct. 31, Toll Brothers, the high-end home builder, noted that cancellations totaled 37 percent of contracts signed in the quarter, up from 18 percent in the same quarter the previous year. Pulte Homes, the builder based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., reported a 36 percent cancellation rate in its third quarter, up from 17 percent in the 2005 third quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Cancellations have really affected big, publicly held builders the most, because they are relatively heavily concentrated in what had been the hottest markets,'' said Dave Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. Basing his findings on a survey of 30 large builders, Mr. Seiders concluded that in November 2006, cancellations constituted 38 percent of gross sales, compared with 26 percent in November 2005 and about 18 percent in the first half of 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the large publicly held builders comprise a minority of the home-building industry. Lawrence Yun, senior economist at the National Association of Realtors, noted that ''smaller home builders aren't affected as much by cancellations because they generally try to sign up clients before they start construction.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its Web site, the Census Bureau acknowledges: ''As a result of our methodology, if conditions are worsening in the marketplace and cancellations are high, sales would be temporarily overestimated.'' By how much? Mr. Carson of AllianceBernstein estimates that the government is overestimating the pace of annual sales by 100,000 to 150,000. Mr. Zandi of Economy.com estimates that the differential is even greater. ''Given the rise in cancellation rates, it suggests that between 150,000 and 200,000 home sales are being counted that actually did not occur.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the rising tide of cancellations leads the Census Bureau to overreport sales in the short term, it leads the government to underreport inventories. New homes on which contracts are not consummated are not added back into the inventory figure. The most recent report found that the seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of November was 545,000, or 6.3 months of supply. Given the high rate of cancellations, it's likely that inventory is substantially higher.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This much is clear: Given the failure of the reports to account for cancellations, demand isn't as strong as it appears, and supply is greater than it seems.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large builders are clearly taking action to remedy the situation. In recent months, they have thrown in extras and cut prices as part of an effort to reduce inventory. These moves may have stemmed the tide of cancellations. ''In our survey of big builders, the absolute volume of sales cancellations did seem to top out in the third quarter,'' Mr. Seiders said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's good news. But it may also mean that the housing market's recovery and stabilization may turn out to be like ski trips planned in the Northeast for the week between Christmas and New Year's. Given the climate, both have been postponed until 2007.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-year building boom on Staten Island, long the city's fastest-growing borough, is decelerating drastically, thanks largely to a reining-in of the island's freewheeling zoning laws, officials say. According to city figures released yesterday, permits for new buildings plunged by 43 percent last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So substantial was the decline that Staten Island almost single-handedly accounted for a 10 percent dip in building permits citywide last year, which was the first drop in the city in a decade.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the other four boroughs, permits fell by 1.6 percent, the figures from the City Buildings Department show.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the real estate market has been cooling all over the city and the country, but city officials and real estate professionals attributed the disproportionate chill on Staten Island to zoning and tax changes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New zoning rules passed in 2004, which were aimed at stemming a flood of town house developments that residents complained were disfiguring communities and overloading streets with traffic, require larger lots and yards and more parking. A tax abatement for new one- and two-family homes was also rescinded last year, further discouraging construction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's one of these perfect-storm situations,'' said Sandy Krueger, chief executive officer of the Staten Island Board of Realtors. ''Everything kind of came together at once: the downzoning, the tax abatement removal and the change in the market. I think everybody is sort of taking a breath here and waiting this out a little bit to see what happens.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, 826 permits for new buildings were issued in Staten Island, compared with 1,441 in 2005 and nearly 2,000 in 2003. Permits for new units of housing also declined more than 40 percent through November, compared with a 1 percent drop elsewhere in the city, according to census statistics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downturn was broadly welcomed in a place where for years development appeared to proceed with pile driver and shoehorn. A one-acre parcel where 18 units of housing could once be built is limited to 7.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't want Staten Island to stop growing,'' said the borough president, James P. Molinaro, who helped lead the drive for the zoning changes, ''but I want proper growth.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in new housing permits issued on Staten Island affected multifamily dwellings as well as smaller buildings. Permits for one-family homes fell 49 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials pointed to several developments planned for the island that they said would be more carefully managed, including a 700-unit waterfront complex in Stapleton, north of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which is expected to bring new life to a vacant port.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the slight citywide drop in new building and housing permits outside of Staten Island, the city's deputy mayor for economic development, Daniel L. Doctoroff, said he saw little cause for concern. New housing construction is slowing dramatically across the country, he said, and total construction spending in New York City is increasing as builders focus on commercial projects.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Particularly relative to the overall national housing market,'' Mr. Doctoroff said, ''and taking into account the fact that through much of the year interest rates were rising, I think by every indicator the market here was very resilient.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Naso, one of Staten Island's biggest builders and the former president of the Building Industry Association of New York City, a trade group, said that zoning changes had been long overdue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We needed some kind of reform,'' he said. ''We'll continue to build, but instead of building 10 you might build 6. It's not the end of the world.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Naso was more upset about the loss of the tax abatement, which cut a homeowner's property taxes for the first eight years after purchase and allowed many first-time buyers into the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Gallo, an opponent of sprawl and a member of the Preservation League of Staten Island, who lives in a turn-of-the-century Victorian house in Stapleton, said he had noticed a slight calming in the air.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a feeling out in Staten Island now that you just can't get away with everything,'' said Mr. Gallo, a real estate broker who works in Brooklyn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since the Verrazano-Narrows bridge was completed in 1964, linking Staten Island to the rest of New York City, people have flocked to the island, developers have worked frenetically to accommodate them, and longtime residents have bemoaned the disappearance of open space and the strain on the island's infrastructure. During the 1990s, Staten Island's population grew by 17 percent and civic discontent skyrocketed. Eventually the clamor brought results.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the zoning change, you were permitted to build a house with a 4-foot backyard,'' Mr. Molinaro said. ''Now you have to have a minimum of 30 feet. You were able to buy a house on Staten Island where your bottom step was the street -- there was no sidewalk. That was legal! You can't do it no more.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staten Island, still by far the least-populous borough in the city, was the fastest-growing county in the state, according to the 2000 census.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not even the fastest-growing borough in the city anymore, having fallen into a virtual tie with Manhattan. From 2003 to 2005, the population in both boroughs grew by about 0.9 percent, according to census estimates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helen Siegel, 52, a schoolteacher who lives in New Springville, in the center of the island, thought back yesterday to the days when cows and pigs from nearby farms used to stroll across her yard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It might have been better had they done this sooner,'' she said. ''It's all built up on every spare inch of land already.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''Drop in Building Permits''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits issued for new buildings on Staten Island have declined sharply since 2003 while increasing in Queens and Bronx and remaining relatively static in Brooklyn and Manhattan, where most buildings have many units.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sale prices for Manhattan apartments fell in the last quarter of 2006, while the pace of sales was reported to be strong and the backlog of unsold apartments fell, according to several market studies released yesterday by large real estate brokerage firms. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new quarterly numbers led brokers and market analysts to conclude that the Manhattan real estate market -- with its legendary high prices -- appeared to have so far escaped the worst of the real estate market excesses, like large price cuts by developers, reported across the country. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It shows us that we hit the soft landing that a lot of people were hoping for,'' said Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared market studies for two brokerage firms, Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new figures were also reported in a series of competitive and sometimes contradictory studies. One report, released by Prudential Douglas Elliman, reported a 5 percent decline in the average apartment sale price, compared with the previous quarter, while one by the Corcoran Group put the decline at 1.5 percent. Both put the average sale price for all apartments at more than $1.2 million. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third study by Mr. Heym showed that average apartment prices actually increased by 5 percent from the prior quarter. But even this study showed weakness in the market. It found that prices for co-ops, the older apartments that make up most of Manhattan's residential real estate, declined by 5 percent, with these declines offset by increased sale prices for condominiums. He said more than half the sales were in new luxury buildings that command premium prices. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet what heartened many market watchers was the market's overall stability, and the rising sales, according to the Prudential report, in what is traditionally a weak quarter. Average prices were higher last quarter than they were in the same quarter a year ago. For all of 2006, average prices were also higher than the previous year, which included the peak quarters of the recent real estate boom. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of December, the Prudential report found that the backlog of unsold apartments had dropped to 5,934 from 7,623, a decline of 22 percent and slightly below the inventory reported a year before, as apartments were sold and overpriced apartments were taken off the market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the Prudential report tracked 2,441 sales in the last quarter of 2006, an increase of 15.5 percent from the prior quarter and a 55 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2005. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., prepared the Prudential report. He said some of the increase in sales might be exaggerated because of improved reporting by New York City, which last summer began providing sales information for previously undisclosed co-op sales. But he said that the increase in reported sales was the largest he had seen in several years, especially in the fourth quarter when sales typically decline an average of 8 percent. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said that he believed the market was strengthening and that it was now ''just barely'' a buyer's market, but one in which buyers were frustrated because sellers were not making significant concessions. He found that the average discount from the final asking price for an apartment fell to 2.8 percent from 4 percent in the previous quarter. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, president of the Corcoran Group, said that sellers are now generally pricing their apartments realistically, and that with the economy strong and Wall Street bonuses high, ''the psychology of the market is very positive.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The big story here is the story that never happened,'' she said. ''The story was supposed to be that prices would crash in 2006, and a strong buyer's market will emerge. Buyers can certainly pick and choose, but those who think they are going to have a field day out there right now are mistaken.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Liebman said the fear of a price collapse caused by a construction boom has not been borne out so far, and the outlook remained good for this year. She said several thousand planned condominiums have instead been turned into hotels and office buildings, as hotel profits and office rentals have risen. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trends in the Manhattan real estate market have always been something of a puzzle, since the average and median prices tend to move up and down with the changing mix of large and small apartments and of apartments in old and new buildings. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the various market studies augment public records of sales with private databases compiled by brokers and appraisers of recent closings that have not yet been reported by the city. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New building sales also distort the data, since sales often close up to a year or more after they go to contract. Ms. Liebman predicted that average sale prices would rise next year as contracts already signed at new expensive luxury buildings with multiple sales of more than $10 million, like 15 Central Park West and the Plaza on Fifth Avenue, are completed. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several reports showed significant price increases in very large apartments with four or more bedrooms and in studios. The reports generally showed the largest increases in very large apartments with four or more bedrooms, with declines in average prices for two-bedroom apartments, which still averaged above $1.5 million per apartment. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, 2006 ended with an average price increase of 6 percent over the previous year's sales, Mr. Miller said, while the median went up by 11 percent. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heym, the economist at Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, attributed the continued strength of the market to the local economy, which he said has produced more jobs last year than in any year since the 2000 boom, and that interest rates that have remained low. Mr. Heym said, ''2006 turned out to be a really good year, much better than people thought.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOUTHOLD -- FORTY-NINE slips of paper with names printed on them tumbled around inside a spinning gold-colored drum at Southold Town Hall one day in early December, as a crowd of nearly 100 waited to see who would be the 22 given the chance to buy homes at prices they could afford.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alison Reiter, 31, an X-ray technician who is living with her parents in nearby Cutchogue, was the first to have her name called. She strode to the front of the room, seeming more nervous than excited. ''I'm still in shock,'' Ms. Reiter said later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She now has the opportunity to buy one of 22 homes to be built on a 7.4-acre wooded parcel in the hamlet of Mattituck, in the town of Southold on Long Island's eastern North Fork. But despite her good fortune, Ms. Reiter is not certain at this point that she will buy one of the houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Community Development Corporation of Long Island, a nonprofit housing organization, bought the land in May for $895,000. Over the previous year working with the town, the group gained approval to rezone the parcel from two-acre residential to ''affordable housing district.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That zoning code, created in 1985, has been amended over the last two years to include restrictions on the prices that owners can set when ready to sell. The new rules also limit owners' rights to alter the property or to create accessory apartments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 22 houses in the development, called the Cottages at Mattituck, will all be two-bedroom 1,100-square-foot single-family homes. Work is to start in January. Prices will be $175,000 for those earning up to 80 percent of the median income on Long Island ($81,900 for a family of three), or $214,000 for those earning 80 percent to 100 percent of the median.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 49 whose names were in the hopper came from a pool of nearly 150 who applied to be in the drawing in August 2005. Applicants were required to meet the income guidelines, be Southold residents and show an ability to secure a mortgage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Community Development Corporation counseled the prospective buyers and approved them for the lottery, said Marianne Garvin, president of the organization. Suffolk County will buy the land from the corporation and transfer ownership to the town, removing the land costs from the purchase price of the homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southold's affordable-housing initiatives are similar to others across the New York metropolitan region. On the East End of Long Island, where some hamlets have median prices topping $1 million, the lack of housing within reach of teachers, police officers, firefighters and others is most acute.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you lose your middle class,'' said Thomas Ruhle, director of housing and economic development for the town of East Hampton, ''what you're left with is poor people and wealthy second-homeowners.'' The town has built about 53 homes in the last five years and is now building 26 affordable rental apartments and planning 26 more homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Long Island Housing Partnership, another nonprofit in the field, has helped to build 115 affordable homes in the five East End towns (East Hampton, Southampton, Riverhead, Southold and Shelter Island). More are planned or under way.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Southampton development, called the Bridgehampton Mews, will have 12 homes, 4 with accessory apartments for elderly residents to rent below market rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suffolk County is creating an affordable-housing project in Yaphank that would guarantee a percentage of homes for local fire and emergency medical volunteers. These services are suffering from the strain of expensive real estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It used to be that folks would work 9 to 5 and have some time to volunteer for community service,'' said Steve Levy, the Suffolk County supervisor. ''Now that time is dedicated to a second job to pay the bills.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Southold, the median home price has shot up over the last few years to $500,000, according to Phillip Beltz, Southold special projects coordinator, who was closely involved in creating the Mattituck development. That is well beyond what local people can afford, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As names were called at the lottery, reactions were eloquent. Some embraced; one woman bowed her head and cried.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Russell Smith, 39, heard his name, he jumped up, pumped his first and burst out with ''Yesss!'' Moments beforehand, he said, he had been praying. ''I had my church family praying for me,'' he added. ''My co-workers were praying for me.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smith grew up in Greenport and still lives with his parents in their house. ''I don't want a handout,'' he said, explaining that he works two jobs, totaling 60 hours a week, teaching and assisting developmentally disabled adults in Greenport, Jamesport and Westhampton.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Ms. Reiter, she said she was still weighing the restrictions that come with buying the homes. The most important, she said, is the limit on the resale price. It must be no higher than the original price plus the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index, a federal measure of price changes, during the time of ownership. In recent years, house prices have tended to rise much faster than the overall price index.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The restriction on the resale price is a result of lessons learned from past affordable-housing attempts, Mr. Beltz said. ''We were trying to find something that would allow homeowners to make some profit, but to limit that,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some ''affordable'' homes of the past are sold today at market rates, Mr. Beltz pointed out. Houses bought for $125,000 in 1992, for example, were on the market in 2004 for $450,000. Without the resale restriction, he maintained, ''you're never going to have an inventory of affordable homes.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Ms. Reiter says she is apprehensive. ''I always thought that if you buy a home, you will make money on it,'' she said. At first blush, that might sound opportunistic. But, for many, making money on a real estate sale on the East End has become a requirement for staying.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Ms. Reiter is not yet married, she foresees a future that includes children. By then, two bedrooms may not be enough.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think prices will go up in Southold a lot,'' Ms. Reiter said. ''So if I sell, I won't be able to afford to buy another house here.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smith, however, agrees with the restrictions on the Mattituck homes, believing they will ensure that other working people can buy homes there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My goal is just to have my own home,'' he said. ''If I have to sell, then I have to do what I'm supposed to do. It should always remain affordable.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a builder's perspective, affordable prices lower the risk of developing a project as long as there are enough units per acre to offset land costs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's good work because affordable housing sells no matter what the market is,'' said Michael Dubb, whose firm built Southwind Village, a 78-unit affordable community in Bay Shore, that many credit with helping to start a revitalization in that village.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island and in other suburbs, Mr. Dubb said, communities often resist allowing builders to exceed town limits on the number of homes per acre. That is why fewer affordable homes are built, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Reiter, meanwhile, said her reservations had not completely overshadowed her excitement about the idea of having her own home. She makes about $48,000 a year, she said, working a full-time and a part-time job. She also volunteers as an emergency medical technician.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To stay in Southold,'' she said, ''the cheapest house is $400,000. That's just way above my means.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales rate for previously owned homes rose in November for the second straight month, an industry group said yesterday, as homeowners eager to unload their properties in a crowded market cut their prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group, the National Association of Realtors, reported that sales of existing homes increased 0.6 percent over October, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.3 million. But sales remained significantly behind last year's levels, falling 10.7 percent from November 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price, the midpoint of prices for homes sold, dropped to $218,000 in November, down 3.1 percent from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said falling prices -- November was the fourth consecutive month in which the price of a previously owned home declined year over year -- were starting to draw back buyers who had been wary after years of double-digit home price increases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Prices coming down are bringing people back to the marketplace,'' said David Lereah, chief economist of the Realtors association. ''That's bad news for people who own houses, but it's working.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While recent signs have led some economists to speculate that the worst of the housing slump has passed, many, including those at the Realtors association, are taking a wait-and-see approach.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe we've hit bottom,'' Mr. Lereah said. ''I'll need another month before I can get comfortable with that statement.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the back-to-back monthly increases in sales of previously owned homes, coupled with a report Wednesday showing a rise in sales of new homes in November, suggests to some economists that the housing decline is starting to stabilize.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Bigg, an economist with Bank of America, said in a research note that the housing reports from this week suggest ''that housing demand has firmed, albeit at a lower level than in 2005.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upturn last month in sales of previously owned homes was largely a result of a 6 percent rise in the Northeast that offset flat sales in the Midwest and a 1.6 percent decline in the South. Sales in the West rose 0.8 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices declined in each region of the country, led by the Midwest, where it fell 3.5 percent, to $165,000, from a year earlier. Prices in the South fell 3.2 percent, to $179,000. In the Northeast, they were down 2.2 percent, at $269,000, and the West was down 0.8 percent, at $351,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the months ahead, selling off the huge supply of unsold homes will be crucial to determining whether the housing market will rebound, analysts said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the time it would take to sell all the existing homes on the market fell to 7.3 months, down from 7.4 months in October. The October number represented the biggest backlog of single-family homes since May 1993.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We still need to clear a huge amount of inventory,'' said David Kelly, an economist with Putnam Investments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a decline in residential construction lopped more than one percentage point off the nation's gross domestic product in the third quarter, strength in other areas of the economy has prevented the housing slowdown from becoming too much of a drag.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The encouraging sign is that the rest of the economy is O.K.,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''And we're really running out of time for housing to hurt the rest of the economy.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, a pair of economic reports suggested that the economy outside of housing is on sturdy footing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence rose this month to the highest level since April. And a report on business activity in the Midwest showed an increase this month, according to the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago. Last month, the report showed a contraction in business activity for the region.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE Napa Valley ranch house, built in the 1970s, wasn't much of a looker. And with a price tag of nearly $1.4 million, it wasn't cheap either. But its location on Highway 29, the main drag through wine country, on an acre of land in the undeniably quaint town of St. Helena caught the attention of Jocelyn Singh. She had spent the last 12 years driving north from her home in Modesto, Calif., to stay in rental homes and increasingly expensive hotels during her regular wine country retreats.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Ms. Singh and her parents, the time was ripe to buy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buy? In this market?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We ended up getting it for $975,000,'' said Ms. Singh, noting that the seller's final price wasn't too far from her initial offer of $950,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the money saved on the purchase price, she was able to plow $120,000 into renovations, raising the ceilings and ripping down walls, and will soon plant grapes on the land. ''By the time we are done with it, it will look very wine country,'' Ms. Singh said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty percent price cuts in asking prices for homes aren't the norm, but stories like this -- with sellers willing to negotiate or even drop their asking prices -- are increasingly popping up in suddenly cooling vacation home markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among second-home shoppers these days, to buy or to rent is often the question. Until this year, the answer was pretty straightforward. Why rent when real estate prices in desirable areas -- from coastal enclaves in Florida to beach towns in the Northeast to desert hideaways out West -- saw a steady annual appreciation of 15 to 20 percent or more?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in prices had buyers lined up at developers' doorsteps, eager to pick up a condo (or two or three), and even the noninvestor types were patting themselves on the back watching their equity rack up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's no secret that real estate activity has nearly ground to a halt this year. Sales volumes are down, inventories of homes on the market are up, and it's simply taking longer, a lot longer in some cases, to move listings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, in many areas where second-home buyers flock, prices are trending downward. Home prices have already taken well-publicized hits in areas like South Florida and the Phoenix area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar areas have witnessed a slowing in sales and an increase in inventory, and price drops may be on the way in those places as well, according to Cynthia A. Kroll, a senior regional economist at the University of California, Berkeley.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since different factors motivate sellers of second homes (after all, a vacation home seller usually doesn't have to unload a property immediately to, say, move to a new job), they simply might take their homes off the market or wait longer to reduce prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's one of the reasons the price effect can lag,'' Dr. Kroll said. ''It can take awhile for the sellers to accept the reality of lower prices.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While second-home buyers aren't as sensitive to pricing as other buyers, slower appreciation sent investors -- who had fueled much of that appreciation -- out of the market. The National Association of Realtors predicts that 30 percent of all home sales for 2006 will have been second homes, down from 40 percent last year, and attributes much of that drop to the exit of investors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the places that saw the biggest influx of investors and the most heated activity are likely to see the biggest price drops. ''Areas that had the highest appreciation and that were the hottest can cool the most,'' said Edward E. Leamer, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the decision whether to rent or own might require the assistance of a crystal ball. After all, is $250,000 for a summer rental in East Hampton ever a wise financial move? Buyers hoping to swoop in on Hamptons bargains will probably be disappointed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sky is not falling,'' said Cee Scott Brown, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group in Sag Harbor, N.Y. ''There really are no good deals.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said prices haven't budged much one way or the other because of ''the standoff'': ''The seller is saying 'I'm willing to sit here,' and the buyer is saying 'I don't want to pay what the last person paid,' '' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A result is that the number of transactions in Hamptons towns like Sag Harbor are off 20 percent from last year, although Mr. Brown said there had been a small surge in recent weeks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farther south, the rental decision seems much clearer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are now in a market across the state of Florida of declining prices,'' said Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla., who tracks the rental market. ''No one wants to buy into a falling market and risk that their home might be worth less than the amount of their mortgage.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So there is a larger rental inventory than usual and ''right now it does make good sense to rent rather than buy,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in some Florida communities have the potential to dip more, according to Mr. McCabe, because of continued activity among condominium developers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Miami right now has over 22,000 condos that are under construction with tens of thousands more announced,'' he said. ''It is the poster child for the bubble. The vast majority will reach the market in 2007 and 2008 and that is when it will get bloody.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ACCORDING to the Florida Association of Realtors, median prices are already falling. In Port St. Lucie and Fort Pierce, median prices for single-family houses dropped around 5 percent in November from a year earlier. The median price for a house in Palm Beach County dropped 6 percent in August from the year before, the first such decline since 1999, and slipped even more the next two months compared to 2005. In Panama City, condo prices were down 28 percent in the third quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real price pressure is even more pronounced when you consider that many sellers are resorting to incentives, anything from free flat-screen televisions to a few months of homeowners' association dues, to lure buyers and their agents. Cathleen Flanagan of ZipRealty in Hollywood, Fla., said she received a flier for a house offering the buyer's agent a commission of 4 percent plus $25,000, if the property sold by the end of the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Provincetown, Mass., there are signs that next summer's rental business might get a boost from the slow sales market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are getting more calls for rentals for next year over last year at least in the three- to four-bedroom range for single-family homes,'' said JD Bower, a sales associate with Provincetown Realty Group, noting that in early December he had already booked homes for July Fourth weekend and for August. ''Everyone across the board is holding off because they think prices are dropping. Sellers are hoping to have properties under contract within the next month and a half, and if they don't, then they will rent it out.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in North Carolina have held up better than most places, but the Outer Banks is among the toughest areas hit, with the average sales price dropping 13 percent in October, and volume off some 30 percent. Investors who bought beach homes to rent are facing higher insurance premiums and higher mortgage payments as adjustable-rate loans were reset to higher rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They bought these big homes expecting rental income,'' said Scott Leggat, vice president of marketing at Outer Beaches Realty. But he added that competition and higher costs has caused their rental income to erode. ''We are even seeing the occasional foreclosure,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters on the Outer Banks should expect a flat market this year, according to Mr. Leggat, with only the most luxurious properties able to command higher rates, a 5 percent jump, over last summer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Northern California, ''properties under $1 million have reverted back to last year's prices,'' said Mike Silvas, the owner of Morgan Lane, a real estate agency with offices in wine country and in coastal areas of Northern California. ''The Carmel market is the one that has really ground to a halt. Prices got to more than $1,000 a square foot and buyers finally balked.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Carmel, prices were off 5 percent this year through October, said Mark Wilson, an agent with Morgan Lane in Carmel. Properties in Monterey County, which includes Carmel, are sitting on the market for an average of 113 days, more than twice as long as a year ago, while in Carmel the average home is taking 93 days to sell.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cape Cod has seen an influx of inventory this year, but that appears to be easing. Sellers, said Jack Cotton, the broker at Sotheby's International Realty of Cape Cod, are seemingly coming to grips with the realization that big-time appreciation is gone. He told of a house with an asking price of $995,000 that sat untouched until the sellers whittled it down. ''It dropped to $750,000 and had five offers,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting, no doubt, isn't for everyone, and some buyers have already been waiting out the market, anticipating a dip. Cindy Lull bought a one-bedroom co-op in Fort Lauderdale this summer after several years of combing through listings, and paid about $75,000 less than the asking price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just as I was ready to tell my agent that we would meet their price, they came down another $1,000,'' Ms. Lull said. ''We waited it out and I'm very glad. We paid a lot less than we would have a year ago.''  </p>
